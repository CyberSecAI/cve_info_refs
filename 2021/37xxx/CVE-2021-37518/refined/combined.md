| **Describe the bug** Attacker can use vimium omnibar feature to execute arbitrary JS code over any site. This can be caused by combination of low entropy PRNG used as vimium "secretToken" as well as invalid messages sent between different content-scripts in page.  **Full Technical Description:** <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BdsJ3IRV05dodVfgWHLDRgM1FTkgswiMPxGHl_ufNho/edit>  **Bug Video:** <https://youtu.be/bklyYCtECF0>  **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behaviour:   1. Checkout this GitHub:    <https://github.com/barakolo/VimiumUXSS> 2. Find out current "VimiumSecret" (This can also be extracted by simple brute-force because of bad PRNG as I explained in the sharable docs):    To do that -    \*\* open Chrome DevTools, and change the Javascript context to “Vimium extension” (Under the Console tab -> click on the arrow sign below it).    b. Now Run this line of code (we are now running it in zotero content-scripts context):    chrome.storage.local.get('vimiumSecret', e=>console.log(e['vimiumSecret']))    c. Save this code aside (this is a small number with a max 10-digits which is being used across all sites). 3. Change Line 27 inside abc.js to the current "vimiumSecret" extracted. 4. Now, open SimpleHTTPServer over this github repo:    python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080 5. Surf to this site, and click enter once or two. 6. Observe that alert() is executed over "example.com" now.   **Browser and Vimium version** Vimium Version: 1.66 (March 2, 2020) Chrome version: 91.0.4472.77 OS version: Windows 10 Home 19042.985 |

| In short - vulnerable lines are: \*The first vulnerable line that generates small secret is here:   [vimium/background\_scripts/main.js](https://github.com/philc/vimium/blob/bdf654aebe6f570f427c5f7bc9592cad86e642b5/background_scripts/main.js#L37)  Line 37 in [bdf654a](/philc/vimium/commit/bdf654aebe6f570f427c5f7bc9592cad86e642b5)   |  | chrome.storage.local.set({vimiumSecret: Math.floor(Math.random() \* 2000000000)}); | | --- | --- |      \*The second vulnerable line is actually the one that gets executeScript message from the background-script and executing this JS in the incorrect frame:   * The background scripts triggers this vulnerable-line inside of the content-scripts:    [vimium/content\_scripts/vimium\_frontend.js](https://github.com/philc/vimium/blob/bdf654aebe6f570f427c5f7bc9592cad86e642b5/content_scripts/vimium_frontend.js#L191)  Line 191   in   [bdf654a](/philc/vimium/commit/bdf654aebe6f570f427c5f7bc9592cad86e642b5)       |  | executeScript(request) { return DomUtils.injectUserScript(request.script); } |   | --- | --- |               This line Doesn't verify request.sender (there might be in there frameId we can use to validate and such).   But probably it's best just to keep unique UUID in each content-script to use when sending/getting repsonses to avoid confusions.   Btw, the start inside of the background context is where it calls the openurlInTab (for javascript: scheme) <https://github.com/philc/vimium/blob/master/background_scripts/main.js#L123> |

| The secret is not exposed to website pages, and this `message` listener only exists after `<script>` finishes and until "a real secret matches", which means up to several hundreds milliseconds. So, I doubt whether it's possible or not to find a correct number in such a short time. |

| Hi, I can place as many event listeners I want as one can embed in a iframe the vomnibar page on purpose for as long as he wants and then retry to find the corrent number till its there. (Also in background without user notice at all)  Aka do this: d = document.createElement('iframe'); d.src='chrome-extension://dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb/pages/vomnibar.html'; document.body.appendChild(d); |

| Also the secret stays the same as long as the browser is on so it gives an attacker alot of time and oportunity to find this secret (as users tend to keep their browsers open, and even if no internet con is available it would work as the extension is locally hosted and attacker just easily broteforce this one) |

| Hi I would love to work on it with you guys, It should not be too much work, just one line change [@gdh1995](https://github.com/gdh1995) Instead of Math.random() usage in secretToken init, we can use this code:  ``` var array = new Uint8Array(32); // 32-byte random token. let rnd_arr = window.crypto.getRandomValues(array); // crypto random according to system choice. let secretToken =  rnd_arr.reduce(function f(a,b) {return a.toString(16) + b.toString(16);});  ``` |

### @barakolo **[barakolo](/barakolo)** commented [Jul 3, 2021](#issue-936257395)

## Description

A fixed security issue - the randomness wasn't enough as an attacker could have tried breaking this random over time, without any limitations.

Please look at the following issue: [#3832](https://github.com/philc/vimium/issues/3832)

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Great work [@barakolo](https://github.com/barakolo) on the bug and this PR. I've adapted the contents of this PR a bit in [1d80e66](https://github.com/philc/vimium/commit/1d80e66aa20f7f1d17d7f16ee046b1253368aa16), and included a stub so that the tests pass. Thanks! |
