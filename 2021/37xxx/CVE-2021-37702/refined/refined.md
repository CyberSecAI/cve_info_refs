Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37702:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper neutralization of formula elements within CSV files during the Data Object CSV import process in pimcore/pimcore.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Formula Injection: The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-controlled data when exporting to CSV format, which allows a malicious user to inject spreadsheet formulas (e.g., `=cmd|' /C calc'!A0`) into CSV fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: If a user opens a maliciously crafted CSV file in spreadsheet software (like Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc) that does not protect against formula injection, the injected formula could be executed. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
- Data Exfiltration: Malicious formulas could also be used to exfiltrate data from the spreadsheet or the victim's system to an attacker controlled server

**Attack Vectors:**
- CSV export of Data Objects: An attacker would need to inject malicious formula strings into the fields of a Data Object. When exporting that data object to a CSV file, the injected formula is written to the CSV. The attacker can then convince a victim to open the CSV.
- User Interaction: The attack requires user interaction. The victim has to download and open the malicous CSV file on their computer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to Pimcore instance: An attacker needs the ability to manipulate data within the pimcore system to add malicious data to a Data Object.
- Victim Interaction: The attacker also needs to somehow convince a victim to download and open the CSV file generated with the malicious data.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content indicates that the vulnerability was specifically found in Data Object CSV exports, and the fix was implemented in version 10.1.1. It also suggests that other CSV export functionalities (Assets, Redirects) might be vulnerable and should be checked as well.
- The fix involves applying a patch that addresses the formula injection vulnerability, referencing the library <https://csv.thephpleague.com/9.0/interoperability/escape-formula-injection/#prevents-csv-formula-injection>.
- The vulnerability is assigned CWE-1236, which corresponds to "Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File".
