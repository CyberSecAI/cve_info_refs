Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from insecure file and folder permissions combined with a service running with SYSTEM privileges.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
1.  Insecure Folder Permissions: The Authenticated Users group has modify permissions to the Gestionale Open installation directory, including the MySQL bin folder. This allows low-privileged users to modify or replace executable files.
2.  Unquoted Service Path: The MariaDB service path contains spaces, which, if not quoted, can lead to a privilege escalation if an attacker creates a malicious executable in a path that matches a portion of the service path. However, the provided exploit focuses on replacing the legitimate executable.
3.  Service Running as SYSTEM: The MariaDB service runs with SYSTEM privileges, meaning that if an attacker can execute code through this service, they can achieve SYSTEM level access.

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation allows a local low-privileged attacker to gain SYSTEM level privileges on the target machine, leading to complete control of the system.

Attack vectors:
1.  The attacker must have local access to the target machine.
2.  The attacker leverages insecure folder permissions to overwrite the mysqld.exe binary with a malicious executable.
3.  The malicious executable is launched when the service restarts, either through a system restart or other means.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
1.  Low-privileged local access to a Windows machine where the vulnerable software is installed.
2.  Ability to download a malicious executable onto the target system, in this case, via `curl`.
3. Ability to rename and overwrite files in the affected directory.
