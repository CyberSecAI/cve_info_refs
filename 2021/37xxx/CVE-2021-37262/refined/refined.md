The content is related to CVE-2021-37262.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of user-controlled `path` and `contextPath` parameters to construct a regular expression used in the `replaceFirst` method.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Regex Injection: The application uses user-provided input to build a regular expression without proper sanitization, leading to a regex injection vulnerability.
- Catastrophic Backtracking: The attacker-controlled regex pattern can cause excessive backtracking during regex processing, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can craft malicious input for the `path` and `contextPath` parameters that, when used in the `replaceFirst` method, leads to excessive CPU usage due to catastrophic backtracking, thus causing a DoS.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP Request: The attack vector is via HTTP requests to the affected endpoint. The attacker can manipulate the `path` and `contextPath` parameters in the request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and control the values of the `path` and `contextPath` parameters.
