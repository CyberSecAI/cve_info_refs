The provided content is a security bulletin from JetBrains that includes a list of resolved security issues in their products during Q2 2021. It includes an entry for CVE-2021-37548.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Plain-text passwords could sometimes be stored in VCS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from the possibility of TeamCity storing passwords in plain text within the Version Control System (VCS). This is a failure to properly handle sensitive information.

**Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of plain-text passwords stored in VCS could lead to unauthorized access to the systems or resources protected by those passwords.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to gain access to the VCS where the plain-text passwords are stored. This could be done by compromising the VCS system itself or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the way the VCS is accessed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs access to the VCS where the TeamCity project's configuration is stored. This access could be gained through compromising a TeamCity user or the VCS directly.
