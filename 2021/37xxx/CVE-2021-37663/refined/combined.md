# Incomplete validation in `QuantizeV2`

Moderate

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-g25h-jr74-qp5j
Aug 11, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.6.0

## Patched versions

2.3.4, 2.4.3, 2.5.1

## Description

### Impact

Due to incomplete validation in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2`, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays:

```
import tensorflow as tf

tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2(
  input=[1,2,3],
  min_range=[1,2],
  max_range=[],
  T=tf.qint32,
  mode='SCALED',
  round_mode='HALF_AWAY_FROM_ZERO',
  narrow_range=False,
  axis=1,
  ensure_minimum_range=3)
```

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_op.cc#L59) has some validation but does not check that `min_range` and `max_range` both have the same non-zero number of elements. If `axis` is provided (i.e., not `-1`), then validation should check that it is a value in range for the rank of `input` tensor and then the lengths of `min_range` and `max_range` inputs match the `axis` dimension of the `input` tensor.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [6da6620efad397c85493b8f8667b821403516708](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/6da6620efad397c85493b8f8667b821403516708).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-37663

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
