    "description": "A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the WebRTC functionality of Google Chrome 92.0.4515.159 (Stable) and 95.0.4623.0 (Canary). A specially-crafted web page can trigger this vulnerability, which can cause a heap buffer overflow and result in remote code execution. Victim would need to visit a malicious website to trigger this vulnerability.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a confusion between the Caller and Callee in WebRTC due to improper handling of ReadableStream and WritableStream objects. A Promise for reading data is created, but inside this Promise, data is written back to the stream, which should be read. This is achieved by using `ReadableStream.getReader()` to read and lock the stream and `WritableStream.getWriter()` object to write data back into the stream, leading to a heap overflow.",

        "Heap-based buffer overflow",
