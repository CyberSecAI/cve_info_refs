- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The OSPF protocol implementation in affected devices fails to verify the checksum and length fields in the OSPF LS Update messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper validation of integrity check value (CWE-354). Specifically, the lack of proper checksum and length verification in OSPF LS Update messages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker could cause interruptions in the network by sending specially crafted OSPF packets.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted OSPF packets over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated remote attacker with the ability to send network packets to an affected device with OSPF enabled. The attacker does not need prior access or privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
