# Integer division by 0 in sparse reshaping

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-95xm-g58g-3p88
Aug 11, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.6.0

## Patched versions

2.5.1

## Description

### Impact

The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.SparseReshape` can be made to trigger an integral division by 0 exception:

```
import tensorflow as tf

tf.raw_ops.SparseReshape(
  input_indices = np.ones((1,3)),
  input_shape = np.array([1,1,0]),
  new_shape = np.array([1,0]))
```

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/reshape_util.cc#L176-L181) calls the reshaping functor whenever there is at least an index in the input but does not check that shape of the input or the target shape have both a non-zero number of elements.

The [reshape functor](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/reshape_util.cc#L40-L78) blindly divides by the dimensions of the target shape. Hence, if this is not checked, code will result in a division by 0.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [4923de56ec94fff7770df259ab7f2288a74feb41](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4923de56ec94fff7770df259ab7f2288a74feb41).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1 as this is the other affected version.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
