Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities identified in RPCMS v1.8, as described in the CVE submission:

**Vulnerability 1: Admin User Registration**

*   **Root Cause:** The `register` function in `system/api/Member.class.php` allows users to specify their role during registration. Although the default is 'member', a user can set the 'role' parameter to 'admin' during registration, effectively creating an admin user.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Insecure user registration process. Lack of proper input validation or sanitization during user role assignment.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can create an administrator account by manipulating the registration parameters, gaining complete control of the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Modifying the 'role' parameter to 'admin' in the registration request through the API.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Access to the registration API endpoint, no authentication required.

**Vulnerability 2: Stored XSS1**

*   **Root Cause:** The `nickname` of a user, which is fetched from the database, is directly displayed in the webpage title and description without proper sanitization in `system/index/Author.class.php`
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper output encoding, leading to Stored XSS.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the user's nickname. This script would execute in the browser of any user viewing a page containing the attacker's nickname.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Manipulating the `nickname` using the `updatePsw` function in the system, specifically within the admin panel.
    *   The vulnerable code is located in the Author controller's index function when a user profile is being viewed.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must have the ability to update the user nickname through the admin interface.

**Vulnerability 3: Stored XSS2**

*   **Root Cause:** Similar to Vulnerability 2, but via the API. The `nickname` of a user can be updated without sanitization through the `/system/api/Member.class.php` using the `post` function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper output encoding, leading to Stored XSS via API endpoint.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the user's nickname, which gets stored in the database. This script would execute in the browser of any user viewing a page containing the attacker's nickname.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Manipulating the `nickname` parameter through the API using the `post` function.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must have the ability to update user profile data through the API.

In summary, the vulnerabilities in RPCMS version 1.8 include insecure admin user registration and multiple stored XSS vulnerabilities, arising from insufficient input sanitization and output encoding. These vulnerabilities could lead to full system compromise and unauthorized access/data manipulation by attackers.
