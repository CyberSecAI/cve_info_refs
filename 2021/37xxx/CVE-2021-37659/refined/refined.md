Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37659:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing check in the `SimpleBinaryOp` class within TensorFlow's `cwise_ops_common.h`. This class is used for binary element-wise operations (cwise ops) and assumes that the two input tensors have the same number of elements, but this is not validated before accessing the tensor data. This missing check causes an issue when the input tensors have differing numbers of elements.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Null pointer dereference:** When input tensors have different numbers of elements, the code attempts to access tensor data that doesn't exist. This leads to a reference being bound to a null pointer, which is later dereferenced, causing undefined behavior.
- **Heap out-of-bounds (OOB) access:**  The code uses `flat()` to access tensor data as a contiguous array of elements, and, because no input sizes are checked, accessing elements beyond the bounds of the allocated tensor memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is undefined behavior. This could potentially lead to crashes or unexpected program states.  The described vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds read, which could be further exploited.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can craft a TensorFlow graph using raw operations such as `tf.raw_ops.SqrtGrad` where the input tensors have different sizes, which will cause a null pointer dereference and heap OOB read during the execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to construct TensorFlow graphs and provide inputs that trigger the flawed logic. This could be achieved through manipulating user inputs to a TensorFlow model.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in all binary cwise operations that don't require broadcasting (e.g., gradients of binary cwise operations).
- The fix involves adding an explicit check to verify input tensor element counts before accessing the data using `flat()`.
- The provided commit `93f428fd1768df147171ed674fee1fc5ab8309ec` includes the necessary fix.
- The vulnerability is considered low severity by the TensorFlow security team.
