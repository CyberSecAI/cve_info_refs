Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to NCH Software's Quorum, potentially matching CVE-2021-37452:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Quorum software stores user information in `.dat` files located on the local disk.
*   These files contain sensitive information, including usernames, passwords, and authentication levels, in cleartext.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Credential Storage:** Passwords and other sensitive user data are stored without any encryption or hashing. This makes them easily accessible if the file system is compromised.
*   **Local File Exposure:** The `.dat` files are stored in a predictable location on the local file system which can be easily found.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker who gains access to the file system can easily retrieve usernames and passwords, allowing them to gain unauthorized access to the Quorum application and potentially the system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can potentially leverage the exposed authentication levels to gain higher privileges within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local File System Access:** An attacker can gain access to the sensitive `.dat` files through various methods, such as:
    *   Compromising the machine where the Quorum server is running.
    *   Exploiting a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, if present, to read the files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have access to the file system of the machine where the Quorum server is installed.
*   The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the predictable path where the `.dat` files are stored.
*   The attacker needs to be able to read or exfiltrate the `.dat` files.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Quorum version 2.03 and earlier.
*   The files are located at `C:\ProgramData\NCH Software\Quorum\Users\{user}.dat`.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a local attack since it requires access to the local file system.
*   The attack is considered an authenticated attack, as the leaked credentials can be used to access the application.
