SSA-818688: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Solid Edge before SE2021MP7

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

SUMMARY

Siemens has released a new version for Solid Edge that ﬁxes three vulnerabilities - an XML external
entity (XXE) injection, and two ﬁle parsing issues which could be triggered when the application reads
OBJ ﬁles.

If a user is tricked to opening a malicious ﬁle using the affected application this could lead the application
to crash, or potentially arbitrary code execution and data extraction on the target host system.

Siemens recommends to update to the latest version and to limit opening of ﬁles from unknown sources
in the affected products.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Avoid opening ﬁles from unknown sources in Solid Edge

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Solid Edge is a portfolio of software tools that addresses various product development processes : 3D
design, simulation, manufacturing and design management.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be

individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37178

An XML external entity injection vulnerability in the underlying XML parser could cause the affected
application to disclose arbitrary ﬁles to remote attackers by loading a specially crafted xml ﬁle.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37179

The PSKERNEL.dll library in affected application lacks proper validation while parsing user-supplied
OBJ ﬁles that could lead to a use-after-free condition. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to
execute code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-13777)
