Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2021-37475:

**Vulnerability Overview:**

The provided content describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in NavigateCMS version 2.9.4 r1561. These vulnerabilities stem from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. The identified injection points are within various PHP files and affect different functionalities within the CMS.

**Specific Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **`block_order` Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `block::reorder` function in `block.class.php` directly incorporates the `blocks-order` parameter from the HTTP request into an SQL `UPDATE` query without proper sanitization. This occurs after an `explode` operation using "#" as the delimiter on the input.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization and direct use of user input in SQL queries.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted `blocks-order` parameter in a POST request to `navigate.php` with `fid=blocks&act=edit`.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary SQL injection, allowing attackers to potentially read, modify, or delete data within the database.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint and some knowledge of the CMS structure.

2.  **`id` Injection in `items.php`:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `items.php` file, when handling comment status changes (`act=change_comment_status`), directly includes the `id` parameter from the HTTP request in SQL queries without sanitization.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization, direct use of user input in SQL queries.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted `id` parameter in a GET request to `navigate.php` with `fid=items&act=change_comment_status`.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary SQL injection, allowing attackers to manipulate comments.
    *    **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

3.  **`products_order` Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `product::reorder` function in `product.class.php` directly incorporates the `products-order` POST parameter into an SQL `UPDATE` query without proper sanitization. Input is split by the "#" character.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization and direct use of user input in SQL queries.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted `products-order` parameter in a POST request to `navigate.php`.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary SQL injection, allowing attackers to potentially read, modify, or delete data related to products within the database.
    *    **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint and some knowledge of the CMS structure.

4.  **`id` Injection in `products.php`:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Similar to vulnerability #2, the `products.php` file, when handling comment status changes, directly includes the `id` parameter from the HTTP request in SQL queries without sanitization.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization, direct use of user input in SQL queries.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted `id` parameter in a GET request to `navigate.php` with `fid=products&act=change_comment_status`.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary SQL injection, allowing attackers to manipulate comments.
    *    **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

5.  **`template-properties-order` Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `property::reorder` function in `property.class.php`, called from `templates.php`, directly incorporates the `template-properties-order` parameter in an SQL `UPDATE` query without sanitization. Input is split by the "#" character.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization, direct use of user input in SQL queries.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted `template-properties-order` parameter in a POST request to `navigate.php` when editing a template.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary SQL injection, allowing attackers to manipulate template properties.
     *    **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint and some knowledge of the CMS structure.

6.  **`children_order` Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `structure::reorder` function in `structure.class.php`, called from `structure.php`, directly incorporates the `children_order` parameter from the HTTP request into an SQL `UPDATE` query without proper sanitization. Input is split by the "#" character.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization, direct use of user input in SQL queries.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted `children_order` parameter in a GET request to `navigate.php` with `fid=structure&act=reorder`.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary SQL injection, allowing attackers to manipulate the structure of the site.
    *    **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Common Weakness:**

The primary weakness in all these vulnerabilities is the lack of proper input sanitization or parameterization of SQL queries. The code directly concatenates user-supplied input into SQL queries, enabling SQL injection attacks.

**Impact:**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:

*   Read sensitive data from the database.
*   Modify or delete data within the database.
*   Potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vectors involve sending crafted HTTP requests (both GET and POST) to specific endpoints within the NavigateCMS application, injecting malicious SQL code through vulnerable parameters.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was fixed by commit [ed3f70b](https://github.com/NavigateCMS/Navigate-CMS/commit/ed3f70b0083f1c2af66e9d71874619824e01350e), which likely involved implementing input sanitization or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided content includes example HTTP requests and SQL queries demonstrating the vulnerability. It also includes screenshots showing the results of the SQL injection in the database, confirming the severity of the issue.
