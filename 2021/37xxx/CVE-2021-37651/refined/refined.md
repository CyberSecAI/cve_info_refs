Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPoolGrad` implementation within TensorFlow.
- The code fails to validate if the input tensor is non-empty. Specifically, it doesn't check for zero dimensions in the input tensor's shape.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap buffer overflow:** When an input tensor with zero dimensions is provided, the code creates an empty `EigenDoubleMatrixMap`.  Subsequently, the code accesses this empty buffer with indices that are outside its bounds, leading to a heap buffer overflow. This occurs because the code assumes that this buffer will have valid dimensions and accesses elements based on the provided pooling sequences.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory corruption:** The heap buffer overflow can lead to memory corruption, which can result in:
  - Program crashes.
  - Potential arbitrary code execution if the corrupted memory is carefully controlled by an attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted input:** An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by crafting a specific input tensor with zero dimensions in its shape, along with specific row and column pooling sequences. The provided example demonstrates such an input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have control over the input tensors supplied to the `tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPoolGrad` operation.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute TensorFlow code and call the vulnerable operation with malicious input.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.6.0.
- The issue is fixed in versions 2.3.4, 2.4.3, and 2.5.1 via cherry-picked commits.
- The provided commit [0f931751fb20f565c4e94aa6df58d54a003cdb30](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/0f931751fb20f565c4e94aa6df58d54a003cdb30) shows the fix which adds checks to ensure that input tensor dimensions are not zero.
- The vulnerability is reported by the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
- The vulnerability is rated as High severity.
