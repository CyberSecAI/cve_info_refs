SUMMARY

A Denial-of-Service vulnerability found in SINUMERIK Controllers could allow an unauthenticated attacker
with network access to the affected devices to cause system failure with total loss of availability.

Siemens has released an update for the SINUMERIK 828D and recommends to update to the latest
version. Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet
available.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

SINUMERIK 808D:
All versions

SINUMERIK 828D:
All versions < V4.95

See recommendations from section Workarounds
and Mitigations

Update to V4.95 or later version
The update can be obtained from your Siemens
representative or via Siemens customer service.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to port 102/tcp to trusted systems e.g. with an external ﬁrewall

• Apply general workarounds.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37199

Affected devices don’t process correctly certain special crafted packets sent to port 102/tcp, which
could allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service in the device.
