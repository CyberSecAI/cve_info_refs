Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37589:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Blind SQL injection found in the `idusuario` parameter of the login page (`/controller/login.php`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection, where the attacker cannot directly see the results of the injected SQL queries in the response, but can infer information by observing the application's behavior (e.g., error messages, response codes, delays).
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `idusuario` parameter, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands and extract sensitive information from the database. This includes but not limited to usernames, passwords, or other confidential data.
- **Potential for Data Modification or Deletion:** Depending on the database user privileges associated with the application, the attacker might be able to modify or delete data, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves crafting malicious HTTP POST requests to the `/controller/login.php` endpoint.
- **`idusuario` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `idusuario`, where the attacker injects SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target system hosting the vulnerable web application.
- **Knowledge of HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of how to craft HTTP requests, including POST requests and form data.
- **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques, specifically blind SQL injection.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit relies on observing changes in the HTTP response codes (e.g., 500 error vs. 200 success with authentication error) based on the injected SQL payloads.
- The provided example demonstrates how the application returns a 500 error for a regular request but changes to a 200 response code with an authentication error message when a SQL injection is performed with `'+AND+'1'='1'--`. This allows for the enumeration of true/false conditions.
- The exploit can be automated using tools like `sqlmap` to enumerate the database.
- The vulnerable software is Virtua Cobran√ßa version 12S.
- The Shodan query `http.favicon.hash:876876147` can help identify vulnerable instances of the software.
