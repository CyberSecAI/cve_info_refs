The provided content is related to CVE-2021-37682.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing checks for `quantization.type` before accessing `quantization.params` in TFLite operations. Specifically, `quantization.params` is only valid when `quantization.type` is not `kTfLiteNoQuantization`. The code directly accesses `quantization.params` without verifying `quantization.type`, leading to potential use of uninitialized values.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of uninitialized values
- Missing validation of `quantization.type` before accessing `quantization.params`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- TFLite operations can use uninitialized values, leading to unpredictable behavior and potentially incorrect results.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could craft a TFLite model where `quantization.type` is `kTfLiteNoQuantization`, but the code attempts to access the `params` field, causing the use of uninitialized values.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create and supply a specially crafted TFLite model.

**Additional Details:**
The vulnerability affects all TFLite operations that use quantization, and the provided GitHub Security Advisory links to specific commits that address the issue:

These commits add the necessary checks to ensure `quantization.params` is accessed only when the `quantization.type` is not `kTfLiteNoQuantization`.
The fix is included in TensorFlow 2.6.0 and was backported to 2.5.1, 2.4.3, and 2.3.4.
