This is due to not checking that the params for the quantization exists. If there is no quantization, we should not access the `.params` field.

# Use of unitialized value in TFLite

Moderate

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-4c4g-crqm-xrxw
Aug 11, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow-lite
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.6.0

## Patched versions

2.3.4, 2.4.3, 2.5.1

## Description

### Impact

All TFLite operations that use quantization can be made to use unitialized values. [For example](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/lite/kernels/depthwise_conv.cc#L198-L200):

```
    const auto* affine_quantization =
        reinterpret_cast<TfLiteAffineQuantization*>(
            filter->quantization.params);
```

The issue stems from the fact that `quantization.params` is only valid if `quantization.type` is different that `kTfLiteNoQuantization`. However, these checks are missing in large parts of the code.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commits [537bc7c723439b9194a358f64d871dd326c18887](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/537bc7c723439b9194a358f64d871dd326c18887),

[4a91f2069f7145aab6ba2d8cfe41be8a110c18a5](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4a91f2069f7145aab6ba2d8cfe41be8a110c18a5) and [8933b8a21280696ab119b63263babdb54c298538](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8933b8a21280696ab119b63263babdb54c298538).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
