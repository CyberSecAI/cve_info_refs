*   The content from `security.netapp.com_f43562cb_20250115_181815.html` explicitly mentions `CVE-2021-37714` and states, "Multiple NetApp products incorporate jsoup. jsoup versions prior to 1.14.2 are susceptible to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could lead to Denial of Service (DoS)." This confirms that this CVE is related to the content.
*   The content from `www.oracle.com_2ed21adf_20250114_202919.html` lists `CVE-2021-37714` under the Oracle GoldenGate section in the risk matrix.
*   The content from `www.oracle.com_2ed21adf_20250114_202919.html` also lists `CVE-2021-37714` under the Oracle Financial Services Crime and Compliance Management Studio in the risk matrix
*   The content from `www.oracle.com_2ed21adf_20250114_202919.html` also lists `CVE-2021-37714` under the Oracle Middleware Common Libraries and Tools in the risk matrix.
*   The content from `www.oracle.com_2ed21adf_20250114_202919.html` also lists `CVE-2021-37714` under the Oracle Stream Analytics in the risk matrix.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The vulnerability lies within the `jsoup` library, specifically in versions prior to 1.14.2. It is related to how the library handles certain inputs.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   The core issue is a vulnerability that can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) if exploited.
    *   The jsoup library is used in multiple NetApp and Oracle products, making them susceptible.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS).

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability can be exploited by providing crafted inputs to the `jsoup` parser.
    *   The attack vector is network-based with a low attack complexity and no required authentication. User interaction is not required, and the scope is unchanged.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs the ability to send crafted inputs to the vulnerable `jsoup` parser within the affected NetApp or Oracle products.
    *   No user interaction is required.

**3. Additional Notes:**

*   The NetApp advisory (`security.netapp.com_f43562cb_20250115_181815.html`) provides specific product information and remediation guidance for its products.
*   The Oracle advisory (`www.oracle.com_2ed21adf_20250114_202919.html`) shows the affected Oracle components.
*  The Oracle advisory provides a CVSS 3.1 Risk rating of 4.9 (Network, Low complexity, no required privileges, no user interaction, no scope change, None Confidentiality, None Integrity, High Availability) for Oracle Stream Analytics. The same advisory document does not include a Risk Matrix CVSS rating for Oracle Financial Services Crime and Compliance Management Studio. The document does, however, provide a risk score of 7.5 for a number of Oracle products, including Oracle Middleware Common Libraries and Tools.
*   The NetApp advisory indicates that a patch is available, and it is recommended to apply it promptly, also suggesting blocking required network protocols or removing privileges to mitigate risks until the patch is applied.
*   The jsoup release notes (`jsoup.org_49e99380_20250114_202910.html`) mention that this vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing.
