Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37451:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Lack of input validation in the IVM (Interactive Voice Response) Attendant software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, specifically both stored and reflected XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript payloads into the application. This can allow them to:
    *   Execute arbitrary scripts in the context of the victim's browser.
    *   Potentially steal cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive information.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Modify the content of the web page displayed to the user.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The following locations are identified as vulnerable entry points for XSS attacks:
    *   **Mailbox name (stored XSS):** Malicious JavaScript can be injected into mailbox names, which are then stored in the system and executed when accessed.
    *   `/ogmlist?folder=`, `/ogmprop?id=`, `/msglist?mbx=` **(reflected XSS):** Malicious JavaScript can be included as parameters in the URL and executed upon accessing these endpoints.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated user:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the IVM application to inject the malicious payloads. This indicates that an unauthenticated attacker would not be able to perform this exploit.
*   **Network Access** The attacker would need to be able to access the IVM application over the network.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects IVM Attendant v5.12 and earlier.
*   The attack type is remote, implying it can be executed remotely over the network if the IVM instance is accessible.
*  The official vendor site is identified as nch.com.au which hosts the software.
