Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-37558:

**CVE-2021-37558**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization of user-controlled input within the `www/class/centreon-knowledge/ProceduresProxy.class.php` file. Specifically, the `getHostId` and `getServiceId` functions construct SQL queries by directly concatenating user-provided `host_name` and `service_description` parameters into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a pre-authenticated SQL injection, which means it can be exploited without any prior authentication to the Centreon system.
    *   The injection point exists within the `proxy.php` script, specifically when handling the `host_name` and `service_description` parameters.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the Centreon database.
    *   This could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete compromise of the Centreon system.
    *   The attacker can potentially create new admin accounts and gain full control of the platform, as the example provided shows the attacker creating a new user with admin privileges.
    *   The attacker can then use their elevated privileges to execute arbitrary commands, as detailed in other vulnerabilities described in the document, including insecure file uploads and command injection, which can ultimately lead to remote code execution (RCE).
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the `proxy.php` file located at `/centreon/include/configuration/configKnowledge/proxy/proxy.php`.
    *   The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the `host_name` or `service_description` parameters, which get directly incorporated into the SQL queries.
    *   The exploitation is possible if the Knowledge Base URL is configured and points to a MediaWiki instance.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker does not need prior authentication to the Centreon system.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Centreon server.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippets are in the `ProceduresProxy.class.php` file, specifically the `getHostId` and `getServiceId` methods:

```php
private function getHostId($hostName)
{
    $result = $this->DB->query(
        "SELECT host_id FROM host WHERE host_name LIKE '" . $hostName . "' "
    );
    ...
}

private function getServiceId($hostName, $serviceDescription): ?int
{
    ...
    $result = $this->DB->query(
        "SELECT s.service_id " .
        "FROM host h, service s, host_service_relation hsr " .
        "WHERE hsr.host_host_id = h.host_id " .
        "AND hsr.service_service_id = service_id " .
        "AND h.host_name LIKE '" . $hostName . "' " .
        "AND s.service_description LIKE '" . $serviceDescription . "' "
    );
    ...
    $result = $this->DB->query(
        "SELECT s.service_id " .
        "FROM hostgroup_relation hgr, host h, service s, host_service_relation hsr " .
        "WHERE hgr.host_host_id = h.host_id " .
        "AND hsr.hostgroup_hg_id = hgr.hostgroup_hg_id " .
        "AND h.host_name LIKE '" . $hostName . "' " .
        "AND service_id = hsr.service_service_id " .
        "AND service_description LIKE '" . $serviceDescription . "' "
    );
    ...
}
```
The `LIKE` operator is used which is also vulnerable, although it's not as widely discussed as direct SQL injections.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text also mentions other vulnerabilities in Centreon, including SQL injections requiring authentication, XSS vulnerabilities, insecure file uploads, and command injections. These are not directly related to CVE-2021-37558, but the document highlights how chaining these vulnerabilities could lead to unauthenticated RCE.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in versions 20.04.14, 20.10.8, and 21.04.2.
