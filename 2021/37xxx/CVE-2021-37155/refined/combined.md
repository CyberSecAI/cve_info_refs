There was a bug in this function that could cause a match to be reported even

when the OCSP request and response in fact had a mismatch.

Great job on the fix making sure cmp is set and also adding a test case. Only optional feedback is the test could make the array's like `response` const to reduce stack use.

| [@haydenroche5](https://github.com/haydenroche5) , this PR now appears to be causing failures in master with --enable-all?  ``` ./configure --enable-all && make  ./scripts/unit.test starting unit tests...  -----------------Porting tests------------------  Begin API Tests    wolfSSL_Init(): passed    wolfSSL_CTX_use_certificate_buffer(): passed    wolfSSL_CertManagerCheckOCSPResponse(): ERROR - tests/api.c line 1254 failed with:     expected: wolfSSL_CertManagerCheckOCSPResponse(cm, response, sizeof(response), ((void *)0), status, entry, request) == WOLFSSL_SUCCESS     result:   -367 != 1  ```  Guessing it has to do with the date in the captured OCSP response? Can you look into this? Thanks |

# wolfSSL Release 4.8.0 (July 09, 2021)

Release 4.8.0 of wolfSSL embedded TLS has bug fixes and new features including:

### Vulnerabilities

* [Low] OCSP request/response verification issue. In the case that the serial number in the OCSP request differs from the serial number in the OCSP response the error from the comparison was not resulting in a failed verification. We recommend users that have wolfSSL version 4.6.0 and 4.7.0 with OCSP enabled update their version of wolfSSL. Version 4.5.0 and earlier are not affected by this report. Thanks to Rainer, Roee, Barak, Hila and Shoshi (from Cymotive and CARIAD) for the report.
* [Low] [CVE-2021-24116](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jh62-5q2g-qjmx "CVE-2021-24116"): Side-Channel cache look up vulnerability in base64 PEM decoding for versions of wolfSSL 4.5.0 and earlier. Versions 4.6.0 and up contain a fix and do not need to be updated for this report. If decoding a PEM format private key using version 4.5.0 and older of wolfSSL then we recommend updating the version of wolfSSL used. Thanks to Florian Sieck, Jan Wichelmann, Sebastian Berndt and Thomas Eisenbarth for the report.
