# Null pointer dereference in `MatrixDiagPartOp`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-fcwc-p4fc-c5cc
Aug 11, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.6.0

## Patched versions

2.3.4, 2.4.3,2.5.1

## Description

### Impact

If a user does not provide a valid padding value to `tf.raw_ops.MatrixDiagPartOp`, then the code triggers a null pointer dereference (if input is empty) or produces invalid behavior, ignoring all values after the first:

```
import tensorflow as tf

tf.raw_ops.MatrixDiagPartV2(
  input=tf.ones(2,dtype=tf.int32),
  k=tf.ones(2,dtype=tf.int32),
  padding_value=[])
```

Although this example is given for `MatrixDiagPartV2`, all versions of the operation are affected.

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/matrix_diag_op.cc#L89) reads the first value from a tensor buffer without first checking that the tensor has values to read from.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [482da92095c4d48f8784b1f00dda4f81c28d2988](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/482da92095c4d48f8784b1f00dda4f81c28d2988).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-37643

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
