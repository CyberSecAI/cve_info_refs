Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37656:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incomplete validation of the `rt_nested_splits` input in the `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToSparse` operation. Specifically, the implementation failed to check if the split values were in increasing order.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incomplete Input Validation:** The `RaggedTensorToSparse` operation did not properly validate the input splits, allowing for non-increasing split values.
- **Potential Null Pointer Dereference:** When the input splits are not in increasing order, a reference can be bound to a null pointer during the operation, leading to undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can cause undefined behavior, which could manifest as a crash, denial of service, or potentially other unexpected issues by providing crafted input to the `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToSparse` operation, specifically non-increasing split values.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToSparse` operation, specifically by crafting the `rt_nested_splits` input with non-increasing values.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to control or influence the input to the `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToSparse` operation, particularly the `rt_nested_splits` argument. This could occur if the attacker can supply inputs to a TensorFlow model or application that uses this operation.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.6.0.
- Patches were applied to versions 2.3.4, 2.4.3, and 2.5.1.
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the ragged splits are non-decreasing.
- The vulnerability is considered low severity.
- The vulnerability was reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
