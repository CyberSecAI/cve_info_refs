# Reference binding to nullptr in `RaggedTensorToSparse`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-4xfp-4pfp-89wg
Aug 11, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.6.0

## Patched versions

2.3.4, 2.4.3, 2.5.1

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference to null pointer in `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToSparse`:

```
import tensorflow as tf

tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToSparse(
  rt_nested_splits=[[0, 38, 0]],
  rt_dense_values=[])
```

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_tensor_to_sparse_kernel.cc#L30) has an incomplete validation of the splits values: it does not check that they are in increasing order.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [1071f554dbd09f7e101324d366eec5f4fe5a3ece](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1071f554dbd09f7e101324d366eec5f4fe5a3ece).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-37656

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

There needs to be a check that the splits allow for valid ragged tensors.
