Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-37416:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. It occurs due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the `single_signout` parameter of the `/LoadFrame` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS: The application reflects the user-supplied input in the `single_signout` parameter without proper sanitization or encoding, allowing an attacker to inject malicious script.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the potential for account takeover. By injecting malicious JavaScript code, an attacker could potentially steal session cookies, redirect the user to a phishing page, or perform other actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted URL containing the malicious JavaScript payload in the `single_signout` parameter. The attacker would need to trick the victim into clicking on the malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing malicious JavaScript and then persuade a victim to visit that URL, typically by social engineering techniques.
