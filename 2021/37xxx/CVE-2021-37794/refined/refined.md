Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-37794:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. It arises from the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data, specifically within uploaded SVG files, that leads to arbitrary JavaScript execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS (CWE-79):** The application fails to properly sanitize or encode the content of uploaded SVG files. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code within an SVG, which is then stored by the application. When accessed/viewed, the malicious script executes in the userâ€™s browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** If an administrator triggers the stored XSS payload, it can lead to the execution of malicious OS commands on the server running the FileBrowser instance.
- **Compromised Application and Server:** Successful exploitation of XSS could allow attackers to take over the FileBrowser instance or the server it's running on.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious SVG Upload:** An authenticated user with upload privileges can upload a specially crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript code.
- **Trigger by Administrator:** The malicious script is triggered when an administrator views or interacts with the uploaded SVG file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to have an account with the ability to upload files to the FileBrowser instance.
- **Administrator Interaction:** The attacker must rely on an administrator to trigger the XSS by viewing or interacting with the malicious SVG.

**Additional Details:**
- **Vulnerable Versions:** FileBrowser versions up to and including v2.15.0 are affected.
- **Fixed Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version v2.16.0 and later.
- **Mitigation:** The commit `201329abce4e92ae9071b9ded81e267aae159fbd` added a `Content-Security-Policy` header, which can help mitigate the risk of XSS attacks. However, this doesn't address the underlying vulnerability that allows for the malicious SVG upload.
