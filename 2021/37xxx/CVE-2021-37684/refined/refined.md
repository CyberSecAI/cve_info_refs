{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The implementations of pooling in TFLite lack checks for divisors being zero, leading to division by zero errors.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Division by zero vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Floating Point Exception (FPE) due to division by zero.",
  "Attack vectors": "TFLite pooling operations with a divisor of zero.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to provide input to TFLite pooling operations that leads to a zero divisor."
