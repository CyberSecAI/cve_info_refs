- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Authenticated command injection vulnerabilities in the ArubaOS command line interface. Specifically, this vulnerability is present in instances of the Mobility Conductor.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command, leading to command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands as a privileged user on the underlying operating system, leading to full compromise of the Mobility Conductor.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through the ArubaOS command line interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to the ArubaOS command line interface as a high privileged user. The vulnerability exists specifically on the Mobility Conductor.
