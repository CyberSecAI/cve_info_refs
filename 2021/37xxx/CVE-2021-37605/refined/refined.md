{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `validate_mic(void)` function within the MiWi software's `mimac_at86rf.c` file, where only two out of the four Message Integrity Check (MIC) bytes are validated.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of MIC bytes."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker might be able to exploit this weakness using brute-force attacks to break into the system due to the reduced search space in MIC validation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Brute-force attacks against the insufficiently validated MIC."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to transmit messages with a modified MIC to the vulnerable system."
