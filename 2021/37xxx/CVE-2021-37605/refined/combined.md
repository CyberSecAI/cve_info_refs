# MiWi™ Software Vulnerability

The following issues affect version 6.5 of MiWi software:

### Early Frame Counter Validation

---

In version 6.5 of our MiWi software and all previous versions including legacy products, there is a possibility of frame counters being validated/updated prior to the message authentication. With this vulnerability in place, an attacker may increment the incoming frame counter values by injecting messages with a sufficiently large frame counter value and invalid payload. This results in denial of service/valid packets in the network. There is also a possibility of a replay attack in the stack.

* Affected products: version 6.5 of MiWi software and all previous versions, including legacy products.
* Vulnerability function and file: bool MiMAC\_ReceivedPacket(void) function in mimac\_at86rf.c file.
* Impact: an attacker may increment the incoming frame counter values by injecting messages with a sufficiently large frame counter value and invalid payload, which results in denial of service in the network. Protection against replay attacks is also not complete in the stack.
* Vulnerability fix details: this vulnerability is fixed in version 6.6 of MiWi software and the [package is available](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/libraries-code-examples-and-more/advanced-software-framework-for-sam-devices#Downloads "package is available").

In the code snippet below, the frame counters were validated/considered before the payload authentication.

### Validation of Only Two Out of Four MIC Bytes

---

In version 6.5 of our MiWi software and all previous versions including legacy products, the stack is validating only two out of four Message Integrity Check (MIC) bytes.

[Learn More](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-37605)

* Affected products: version 6.5 of MiWi software and all previous versions including legacy products.
* Vulnerability function and file: bool validate\_mic(void) function in mimac\_at86rf.c file.
* Impact: this vulnerability might allow someone to break in using brute force attacks.
* Vulnerability fix details: this vulnerability is fixed as part of version 6.6 of MiWi software; the [package is available](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/libraries-code-examples-and-more/advanced-software-framework-for-sam-devices#Downloads).

In the code snippet below, only two out of four MIC bytes were used.

# MiWi™ Protocol

## Low-Cost Embedded Wireless Connectivity for Commercial and Smart Home Networks

---

Developed to enable low-cost, commercial and smart home networks, the MiWi™ protocol is used in applications such HVAC systems and alarm sensors where reliable self-healing mesh networking is needed. The MiWi protocol supports operation in the IEEE 802.15.4 radio PHY in the sub-GHz and 2.4 GHz ISM bands.

The MiWi protocol stack offers a significantly smaller footprint relative to the open standard-based Zigbee® compliant protocol stack. This enables operation in microcontrollers with smaller memory/lower cost. A typical end node requires only 20 KB of code space.

![](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/wireless-connectivity/sub-ghz/miwi-protocol/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/container_1812793388/isolatedimage/image.coreimg.jpeg/1612819778963/miwi-topology-image.jpeg)

Our MiWi Mesh Stack is available for [Microchip Studio](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/microchip-studio "Microchip Studio"), the Integrated Development Platform (IDP) for developing and debugging all AVR® and SAM microcontroller applications. Microchip Studio gives you a seamless and easy-to-use environment to write, build and debug your applications written in C/C++ or assembly code. The MiWi Mesh code is part of the [Advanced Software Framework (ASF)](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/libraries/advanced-software-framework "Advanced Software Framework (ASF)").

ASF: Release ASF-3.51.0

The Atmel® Software Framework (ASF, www.atmel.com/asf) is a compilation of
embedded software for Atmel flash MCUs: megaAVR®, AVR XMEGA®, AVR UC3
and SAM devices. It has been designed to help develop and glue together the
different components of a software design. It can easily integrate into an operating
system (OS) or run as a stand-alone product.

The ASF is included in Atmel Studio® 6 (www.atmel.com/atmelstudio). A separate
package is available for megaAVR, AVR XMEGA, AVR UC3 and SAM users for
IAR™, Atmel AVR Studio 4 and AVR32 Studio on www.atmel.com/asf. Atmel Studio
users do not need this package as the ASF is integrated in Atmel Studio.

This document describes the supported devices, supported tools, and changes
since last ASF release (enhancements, bugs fixes and known issues).

# Advanced Software Framework (ASF)

## Advanced Software Framework (ASF) for SAM Devices

---

The Advanced Software Framework (ASF) provides a rich set of proven drivers and code modules developed by experts to reduce design time. It simplifies the usage of microcontrollers by providing an abstraction to the hardware through drivers and high-value middleware. ASF is a free and open-source code library designed to be used for evaluation, prototyping, design and production phases.

The latest SAM and PIC32C MCUs are not supported in ASF. ASF3 and ASF4 libraries are supported in maintenance mode only. We recommend starting new projects with our MPLAB® Harmony embedded software development framework for SAM and PIC32 MCUs.

MPLAB Harmony v3 is a fully integrated embedded software development framework that provides flexible and interoperable software modules to simplify the development of value-added features and reduce your product’s time to market.

## ASF4

ASF4, supporting the SAM microcontroller product line (as well as a number of wireless example projects), is the fourth major generation of ASF. It represents a complete redesign and implementation of the framework to improve the memory footprint and code performance, as well as to better integrate with the Atmel START web user interface. ASF4 must be used in conjunction with Atmel START, which replaces the ASF Wizard of ASF3.

For a description of ASF4 system context, see: [ASF4: Atmel START, Software Content and IDEs](https://microchipdeveloper.com/atstart%3Astart "ASF4") (from ASF4 API Reference Manual).

* **Configurator**: [Atmel START](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/search-discover/atmel-start "Atmel START") must be used with Atmel START
* **IDE Support**: [Atmel Studio 7](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/ATSAMB11-BluSDK-SMART-v5.2-for-AtmelStudio7-Release-Notes.pdf "Atmel Studio 7"), [Keil uVision](http://www2.keil.com/mdk5/uvision/ "Keil uVision") or [IAR Embedded Workbench](https://www.iar.com/iar-embedded-workbench/#!?architecture=Arm "IAR Embedded Workbench")

## ASF3

ASF3 is an MCU software library providing a large collection of embedded software for AVR® and SAM flash MCUs and Wireless: megaAVR®, AVR XMEGA®, AVR UC3, SAM devices, ATWINC, ATWILC and ATBTLC. ASF3 is configured by the ASF Wizard in Atmel Studio 7 (installed as an extension to Studio). ASF3 is also available as a standalone (\*.zip) with the same content as Studio extension.

* **Configurator**: ASF3 is configured by the ASF Wizard in [Atmel Studio 7](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/ATSAMB11-BluSDK-SMART-v5.2-for-AtmelStudio7-Release-Notes.pdf "Atmel Studio 7")
* **IDE Support**: ASF3 works with [Atmel Studio 7](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/ATSAMB11-BluSDK-SMART-v5.2-for-AtmelStudio7-Release-Notes.pdf "Atmel Studio 7") (also [Atmel Studio 6](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/archives/avr-sam-mcus "Atmel Studio 6"))

ASF: Release ASF-3.50.0

The Atmel® Software Framework (ASF, www.atmel.com/asf) is a compilation of
embedded software for Atmel flash MCUs: megaAVR®, AVR XMEGA®, AVR UC3
and SAM devices. It has been designed to help develop and glue together the
different components of a software design. It can easily integrate into an operating
system (OS) or run as a stand-alone product.

The ASF is included in Atmel Studio® 6 (www.atmel.com/atmelstudio). A separate
package is available for megaAVR, AVR XMEGA, AVR UC3 and SAM users for
IAR™, Atmel AVR Studio 4 and AVR32 Studio on www.atmel.com/asf. Atmel Studio
users do not need this package as the ASF is integrated in Atmel Studio.

This document describes the supported devices, supported tools, and changes
since last ASF release (enhancements, bugs fixes and known issues).

Issue #ASFP-3595: ASF includes its own SAM header files set which is not synchronized with the latest header
files from Atmel Studio 6.1 toolchain.

The Atmel Studio 6.1beta header files set for SAM devices is not backward compatible with the Atmel
Studio 6.0 header files set.
ASF SAM drivers are using their own set of header files (from sam/utils/cmsis/sam*/include) and are
not compatible with the Atmel Studio 6.1beta header files.
SAM drivers will be ported to the new Atmel Studio 6.1beta header files set in a later ASF release.
