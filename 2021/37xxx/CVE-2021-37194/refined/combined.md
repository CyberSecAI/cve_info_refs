V1.2

SUMMARY

Multiple vulnerabilities were identiﬁed in the web components of COMOS that could allow an attacker to
conduct code injections, store data in undesired locations, execute arbitrary SQL statements, and run
cross-site request forgery attacks.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet
available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• For COMOS V10.4.1 / V10.3.3.3 and CVE-2021-37194: Use the new whitelisting feature, to specify

the ﬁletypes that are allowed to be uploaded

• CVE-2021-37196 can be mitigated in all versions by making the root directory of the web server

read only

Product speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

COMOS is a uniﬁed data platform for collaborative plant design, operation and management that supports
collecting, processing, saving, and distributing of information throughout the entire plant lifecycle.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37194

The COMOS Web component of COMOS allows to upload and store arbitrary ﬁles at the webserver.
This could allow an attacker to store malicious ﬁles.

4.3
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37195

The COMOS Web component of COMOS accepts arbitrary code as attachment to tasks. This could
allow an attacker to inject malicious code that is executed when loading the attachment.
