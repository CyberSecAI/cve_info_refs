Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37194:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of restrictions on file uploads in the COMOS Web component, allowing users to upload and store arbitrary files on the webserver.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

The primary weakness is the "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type" (CWE-434). This means the system does not properly validate the types of files being uploaded, leading to potential security risks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to upload and store malicious files on the webserver. While the advisory doesn't specify the exact impact of storing malicious files, this could potentially lead to:
*   Executing malicious code via server-side vulnerabilities if the uploaded files are processed by the server.
*   Exfiltration of sensitive information if an attacker uploads a script that can be executed on a userâ€™s browser, and then redirects the information to attacker.
*   Denial of Service if an attacker fills up the server storage space using multiple files.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vector is through the web interface of the COMOS application, by uploading malicious files via the vulnerable upload functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

The attacker needs to have authenticated access to the COMOS Web component with the ability to upload files. The vulnerability is marked as "PR:L" meaning low privileges are required.

**Additional details:**

*   The advisory specifies that a fix for versions below V10.4.1 and V10.3.3.3 is not planned. Mitigation is recommended through the use of a new whitelisting feature that restricts allowed file types, specifically for affected COMOS versions.
*   The advisory also mentions that the vulnerability is being publicly exploited (E:P)
