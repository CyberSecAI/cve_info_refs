- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unsanitized user input is passed to a file deletion function (`unlink()` in PHP), allowing an attacker to control the path of the file to be deleted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file deletion vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-supplied file paths.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can delete any file within the web root or other locations the PHP process has write access to. This can lead to the removal of critical files, including those that implement security measures (like `.htaccess`).
- **Attack vectors**: By intercepting requests and modifying the "del_file" parameters to point to arbitrary file paths on the server, attackers can delete those files. This can be done in multiple areas of the application including member profile editing, article editing, and site settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a logged-in user (either member or admin) and be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
