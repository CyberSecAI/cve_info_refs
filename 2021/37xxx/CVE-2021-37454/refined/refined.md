Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Lack of input validation in the Axon PBX software. This allows users to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into various fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Both Stored and Reflected XSS are present.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Account Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information, leading to account hijacking.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify data displayed to users of the Axon PBX system.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites or force malware downloads.
*   **Unauthorized Access/Actions:** An attacker might be able to perform actions within the application on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into several fields within the Axon PBX application:
    *   `Extension name` (Stored XSS)
    *   `Line name` (Stored XSS)
    *   `Outbound dialing plan` (Stored XSS)
    *   `blacklist ip` (Stored XSS)
    *   `SipRule` (Stored XSS)
    *   `Primary phone` (Stored XSS)
    *   `Customer name` (Stored XSS)
    *   `/planprop?id=` (Reflected XSS)
    *  `/extensionsinstruction?id=` (Reflected XSS)
    *   `/ipblacklist?errorip=` (Reflected XSS)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an authenticated account within the Axon PBX system to inject malicious scripts.
*   **Remote Access:** The attack is conducted remotely, as the attacker injects malicious code through the web interface.

**Additional Details:**

* The information from the github.com link provides a detailed list of the affected parameters.
* The NCH website indicates that the software is legacy and no longer supported, meaning this vulnerability is unlikely to be patched.
* The vendor provided a general security warning regarding the admin user having access to files on the system, which may be related to this or other vulnerabilities.
