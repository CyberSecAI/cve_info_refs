Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31805:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from `cwiki.apache.org` directly relates to CVE-2021-31805. It identifies the vulnerability as a "Forced OGNL evaluation" issue, which is consistent with the description. The other content provided from NetApp and Oracle both mention the CVE in the context of a security advisory/patch update, which further confirms the relevance.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is an incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability (CVE-2020-17530/S2-061). This incomplete fix failed to prevent double evaluation of OGNL expressions when applied on raw, unvalidated user input within certain tag attributes.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The weakness lies in the potential for double evaluation of OGNL expressions when forced evaluation syntax `%{...}` is used. This can occur when a developer uses forced OGNL evaluation on tag attributes that use untrusted user input.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   Disclosure of sensitive information.
    *   Addition or modification of data.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS).
*  **Attack Vectors:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability through web requests or other methods that send unvalidated user input to application components that use Apache Struts tags with OGNL expressions.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious input into tag attributes that use forced OGNL evaluation `%{...}`. This typically involves an application that uses Apache Struts, but no special privileges or prior authentication may be required, depending on the exact point of vulnerability.

**3. Additional Details and Notes:**

*   The `cwiki.apache.org` content specifies that the vulnerability exists in Apache Struts versions 2.0.0 through 2.5.29. It also notes that the vulnerability stems from a developer error when forced OGNL is used on unvalidated user input.
*   The NetApp advisory (NTAP-20220420-0001) states that no supported NetApp products are affected and details the affected versions.
*  The Oracle advisory mentions the CVE in the product advisory table, specifying that "Oracle Hospitality OPERA 5" is affected in version 5.6. The advisory also indicates that this is a remote exploit without authentication vulnerability.
*   The `security.netapp.com` content indicates a high CVSS v3.1 score of 9.8 for CVE-2021-31805.
*   The `security.netapp.com` content also highlights that the vulnerability may be exploited remotely without authentication.

**4. Summary of Findings:**

The provided content confirms that CVE-2021-31805 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability due to the incomplete fix of a previous issue. This vulnerability arises due to potential double OGNL expression evaluation within Apache Struts, specifically when forced OGNL is used on untrusted user input. While NetApp products are mostly unaffected by this vulnerability, the Oracle advisory explicitly states that it affects "Oracle Hospitality OPERA 5." The vulnerability is remotely exploitable and does not require prior authentication, making it a high-risk security concern.
