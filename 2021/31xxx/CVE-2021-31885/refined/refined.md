Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-31885:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The TFTP server application in Nucleus RTOS allows reading the contents of the TFTP memory buffer due to malformed TFTP commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value:** The TFTP server does not properly validate the length of the input received in TFTP commands, allowing attackers to read from the TFTP memory buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leak:** An attacker can read the contents of the TFTP memory buffer, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information.
*   No Denial-of-service or integrity impact is mentioned for this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:**  The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated remote attacker:** The attacker does not need any prior access or privileges to exploit this vulnerability. They need network access to the vulnerable device.

**Additional Details:**

*   This vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities ("NUCLEUS:13") found in the Nucleus RTOS TCP/IP stack.
*   The vulnerability exists in the TFTP server application within Nucleus RTOS.
*   The provided document (SSA-845392, SSA-044112, SSA-114589) also includes a CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C) for this vulnerability.

*   The advisory SSA-114589 mentions a mitigation for this vulnerability which is to disable the FTP service as this vulnerability is in the TFTP server.
