Welcome!

This is the non-wiki privacy policy of the Wikimedia Foundation ("WMF"). This privacy policy applies to WMF's non-wiki sites, unless stated otherwise on a specific site. Some of our non-wiki sites may be hosted by third-party service providers. In these cases, we will provide a link to that service provider's privacy policy. The Wikimedia Foundation's main [Privacy policy](/wiki/Special%3AMyLanguage/Policy%3APrivacy_policy "Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Privacy policy") a separate document, and applies to wiki-based sites.

This Non-wiki Privacy Policy applies to our collection and handling of information about you that we receive as a result of your use of non-wiki sites. By using these sites, you agree to be held to the terms of this Non-wiki Privacy Policy and the Wikimedia [Terms of Use](/wiki/Special%3AMyLanguage/Policy%3ATerms_of_Use "Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Terms of Use"). If you do not wish to be held to the terms of this Non-wiki Privacy Policy and/or our terms of use, please do not use these sites.

For the sake of clarity, definitions in this Non-wiki Privacy Policy take on the same definitions found in the [main WMF Privacy Policy](/wiki/Special%3AMyLanguage/Policy%3APrivacy_policy "Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Privacy policy"). The sites covered by this Non-wiki Privacy policy are separate websites, and are [not covered](/wiki/Special%3AMyLanguage/Policy%3APrivacy_policy#coverage "Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Privacy policy") by the general Wikimedia Privacy Policy. If a non-wiki site has an alternative privacy policy, it will link to that policy. If you have any questions or suggestions about this Non-wiki Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use, please [Contact us](https://wikimediafoundation.org/about/contact/ "foundationsite:about/contact/").

Thank you!

## What Information We Collect and What We Do With It

### Personal data: Non-personally identifiable information

Like most website operators, WMF collects personal data in the form of non-personally-identifiable information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, including, but not limited to: the browser type, language preference, referring site, and date and time of each visitor request. We collect this personal data to understand how you interact with these non-wiki sites and related materials, maintain and improve these non-wiki sites and related materials, and protect against malicious users. From time to time, WMF may publicly release such personal data in aggregated or anonymized form, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of any of our sites.

### Personal data: Personally identifying information

Depending on how you choose to use this site, you may disclose different amounts of personal data that could be used to identify you (such as your IP address, user agent information, or general location). We will keep this information confidential, except as provided in this  Non-wiki Privacy Policy.

We use this information for our legitimate interests, including to understand how you interact with these non-wiki sites and related materials, maintain and improve these non-wiki sites and related materials, and protect against malicious users.

If you provide an email address, we may use it to contact you or send you surveys so that we can better understand how you use our services and how we can improve our services, or to update you about the Wikimedia Foundation, projects and activities. These surveys are always optional. Each message will contain information about how to opt-out of further emails.

### Cookies and other data collection tools

We may also use some common data storage technologies, including but not limited to: cookies, local storage, JavaScript, or tracking pixels, to obtain information that could identify you. We keep this information confidential, except as provided in this Non-wiki Privacy Policy. We use this information to make your experience with these non-wiki sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and user interaction with these non-wiki sites, and to generally improve our services. You may remove or disable some or all cookies and locally stored data through your browser settings, depending on your browser. While cookies and locally stored data may not be necessary to use these non-wiki sites, some features may not function properly if you disable cookies and/or local storage. If we ever use third-party cookies on these non-wiki sites, we will update our [Cookie Statement](/wiki/Special%3AMyLanguage/Policy%3ACookie_statement "Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Cookie statement") to provide details of the cookie(s) in question. You can read more about some of the specific cookies we use, when they expire, and what we use them for in the main WMF Privacy Policy's [frequently asked questions (FAQ)](/wiki/Special%3AMyLanguage/Policy%3APrivacy_policy/Frequently_asked_questions#cookieFAQ "Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Privacy policy/Frequently asked questions").

## When We Can Share Information

### With Your Permission

We may share your information for a particular purpose, if you agree, or as otherwise specified below.

### Third-Party Service Providers

As hard as we may try, we cannot do it all. We may share your information (including your email address and general location information) with people we work with (e.g., third-party service providers, contractors, community volunteers) in order to help maintain, better understand, or improve these non-wiki sites or other [Wikimedia Projects](https://www.wikimedia.org/) and sites. In the course of providing their services to us, some of these third-party providers and contractors may also collect and retain user information, including but not limited to user emails and general user location information based on IP addresses, in accordance with their privacy policies and any additional requirements we may put in place with them. As necessary, we may put safeguards, such as confidentiality agreements, in place to help ensure that these service providers protect the confidentiality of your personal information.

### For Legal Reasons

We may access, preserve, or disclose your personal information if we reasonably believe it necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. However, if we believe that a particular request for disclosure of a user's information is legally invalid or an abuse of the legal system and the affected user does not intend to oppose the disclosure themselves, we will try our best to fight it. We are committed to notifying you via email at least ten (10) calendar days, when possible, before we disclose your personal information in response to a legal demand. However, we may only be able to provide notice if we are not legally restrained from contacting you, there is no credible threat to bodily harm that is created or increased by disclosing the request, and you have provided us with an email address.

Nothing in this Non-wiki Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you may have to a third party's request (whether it be civil, criminal, or governmental) to disclose your information. We recommend seeking the advice of legal counsel immediately if such a request is made involving you.

### Transfer of WMF

In the extremely unlikely event that ownership of all or substantially all of the Foundation changes, or we go through a reorganization (such as a merger, consolidation, or acquisition), information collected under this Non-wiki Privacy Policy may transferred to the new owner(s) of the Foundation or become subject to a different privacy policy such as the privacy policy of an acquirer.

### To Protect You, Ourselves, or Others

We may need to share your personal information if it is reasonably believed to be necessary to: enforce or investigate potential violations of our Terms of Use or this Non-wiki Privacy Policy; investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions; prevent imminent and serious bodily harm or death to a person; protect our organization, employees, contractors, users, or the public; or detect, prevent, or otherwise assess and address potential spam, malware, fraud, abuse, unlawful activity, and security or technical concerns.

### To Learn and Experiment

We may share non-personal or aggregated information with researchers, scholars, academics, and other interested third parties who wish to study the Wikimedia Sites, including these non-wiki sites. Sharing this information helps them understand usage, viewing, and demographics statistics and patterns. They then can share their findings with us and our users so that we can all better understand and improve the Wikimedia Sites.

When we give access to personal information to third-party developers or researchers, we put requirements, such as reasonable technical and contractual protections, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your information consistently with the principles of this Policy and in accordance with our instructions. If these developers or researchers later publish their work or findings, we ask that they not disclose your personal information. Please note that, despite the obligations we impose on developers and researchers, we cannot guarantee that they will abide by our agreement, nor do we guarantee that we will regularly screen or audit their projects. (You can learn more about re-identification in the main WMF Privacy Policy's [frequently asked questions (FAQ)](/wiki/Special%3AMyLanguage/Policy%3APrivacy_policy/Frequently_asked_questions "Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Privacy policy/Frequently asked questions").)

In general, WMF does not disclose personal information obtained through these WMF non-wiki sites other than as described in this Non-wiki Privacy Policy.

## Information You Share with Third Party Services

These non-wiki sites may allow you to access third-party services through their interface. For example, if you click on a "Share" button, or a link contained in a blog post, you may be connected to an external website such as a Twitter post or a New York Times article. Please note that this Privacy Policy only governs information we collect, and you are responsible for reading and understanding privacy policies and practices of the third-party services that you use.

## How Do We Protect Your Data?

We strive to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures (such as access control procedures, network firewalls, and physical security) designed to protect our systems and your personal information. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as completely secure data transmission or storage, so we cannot guarantee that our security will not be breached (by technical measures or through violation of our policies and procedures).

### Accessing Your Information

WMF works hard to accurately process and maintain information. If you would like to access, correct, update, suppress, restrict or delete the personal information we have about you, object to our processing of such personal information or if you would like to request to receive an electronic copy of your personal information for purposes of transmitting it to another organization (to the extent this right to data portability is provided to you by applicable law), or if you would like to change your WMF communication preferences, you (or an authorized representative) can let us know by contacting us at privacy![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/15px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia.org. While we will make reasonable efforts to comply with your request, there are certain situations where we will not grant your request (such as when we cannot adequately verify your identity to give you access to personal information, when we are legally required to retain information, or when we are not technologically able to change or delete information). Therefore, the granting of such requests remains at the sole discretion of WMF.

### How Long Do We Keep Your Data?

Once we receive personal information from you, we keep it for the shortest possible interval that is consistent with the maintenance, understanding, and improvement of these non-wiki sites and our obligations under applicable U.S. law. For more information on Wikimedia's data retention policies, please see our [Data Retention Guidelines](/wiki/Special%3AMyLanguage/Legal%3AData_retention_guidelines "Special:MyLanguage/Legal:Data retention guidelines").

## Transfer of Information to the United States

If you decide to access or use these non-wiki sites, whether from inside or outside of the U.S., you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, processing, disclosure, and other uses of your information in the U.S. as described in this Non-wiki Privacy Policy. You also consent to the transfer of your information by us from the U.S. to other countries, which may have different or less stringent data protection laws than your country, in connection with providing services to you.

## Our Response to Do Not Track

We are strongly committed to protecting users' nonpublic information. Under this Policy, we may share your information only under particular situations, which you can learn more about in the "When We Can Share Information" section of this Privacy Policy.

Because we protect all users in accordance with this Non-wiki Privacy Policy, we do not change our behavior in response to a web browser's "do not track" signal. For more information regarding Do Not Track signals and how we handle them, please visit the main WMF Privacy Policy's [frequently asked questions (FAQ)](/wiki/Special%3AMyLanguage/Policy%3APrivacy_policy/Frequently_asked_questions#DNTFAQ "Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Privacy policy/Frequently asked questions").

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

Because things naturally change over time and we want to ensure our Privacy Policy accurately reflects our practices and the law, we reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will provide notice of changes to this Privacy Policy in a reasonable time and manner.

We ask that you please review the most up-to-date version of this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of these non-wiki sites after any subsequent version of this Privacy Policy becomes effective constitutes acceptance of that version of the Privacy Policy on your part.

## Contact us

If you have questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, or the information collected under this Privacy Policy, please email us at privacy![@](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/15px-At_sign.svg.png)wikimedia.org or [contact us](https://wikimediafoundation.org/about/contact/ "foundationsite:about/contact/") directly.

Depending on your jurisdiction, you also may have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority competent for your country or region.

## Thank You!

Thank you for reading our Non-wiki Privacy Policy. We hope you enjoy using the Wikimedia sites, and appreciate your participation in creating, maintaining, and constantly working to improve the largest repository of free knowledge in the world.

## Wikipedia volunteers work every day to curate the world’s knowledge. [Take a look back at what happened on Wikipedia in 2024](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wikipedia-year-in-review-2024/)

The nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation provides the essential infrastructure for free knowledge. We host Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia, created, edited, and verified by volunteers around the world, as well as many other vital community projects. All of which is made possible thanks to donations from individuals like you. We welcome anyone who shares our vision to join us in collecting and sharing knowledge that fully represents human diversity.

## Wikimedia projects belong to everyone

You made it. It is yours to use. For free. That [means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AReusing_Wikipedia_content) you can use it, adapt it, or share what you find on Wikimedia sites. Just [do not write your own bio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AConflict_of_interest), or copy/paste it into your homework.

2

## We respect your data and privacy

We do not sell your email address or any of your personal information to third parties. More information about our privacy practices are available at the [Wikimedia Foundation privacy policy](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Privacy_policy), [donor privacy policy](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Donor_privacy_policy/en), and [data retention guidelines](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_retention_guidelines).

## People like you keep Wikipedia accurate

Readers [verify the facts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AVerifiability). Articles are collaboratively created and edited by a community of volunteers using [reliable sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AVerifiability#What_counts_as_a_reliable_source), so no single person or company owns a Wikipedia article. The Wikimedia Foundation does not write or edit, but [you and everyone you know can help](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help%3AContents).

## Not all wikis are Wikimedia

The word “[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki)” refers to a website built using collaborative editing software. Projects with no past or existing affiliation with Wikipedia or the Wikimedia Foundation, such as Wikileaks and wikiHow, also use the term. Although these sites also use “wiki” in their name, they have nothing to do with Wikimedia.

## Research

We conduct our own research and partner with researchers worldwide to address change in society and technology.

[More about research](https://wikimediafoundation.org/research/)![](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Wikimedia_Conference_2017_–_228-e1533253661801.jpg?w=600&h=338&crop=1)

## Technology

From site reliability to machine learning, our open-source technology makes Wikipedia faster, more reliable, and more accessible worldwide.

[More about technology](https://wikimediafoundation.org/technology/)![](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-30-at-1.24.58-PM-e1533254033550.png?w=600&h=338&crop=1)

## Advocacy

We fight to protect everyone’s right to access free and open knowledge.

[More about advocacy](https://wikimediafoundation.org/advocacy/)![](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SOPA_protest_in_Midtown_NYC-e1533254825755.jpg?w=600&h=338&crop=1)

## Collaborative projects are the core of the Wikimedia movement

Our volunteers build tools, share photos, write articles, and are working to connect all the knowledge that exists.

Throughout history, knowledge has been controlled by a powerful few. [Wikipedia needs knowledge from all languages and cultures.](https://whoseknowledge.org/issues/public-online-knowledge/) The internet has become the default for accessing information—women, people of color, and the global south remain underrepresented. We invite you to help correct history.

# Description

An example filter:

```
action == 'createaccount'
& accountname contains 'test'
```

with "block" as option for when the rule is matched results in AbuseFilter blocking the underlying IP creating the account but not the account itself.

I think that it'd be a better approach if AbuseFilter let the account being created, and after creation AbuseFilter did blocked the account.

This will also prevent the abuse log to expose the IP addresses of accounts being created. A bad faith or misconfigured edit filter could be set to collect all IP addresses of accounts being created and that's not okay. And also avoids SUL fragmentation. No local wiki can now use the title blacklist to prevent account creations but Meta-Wiki using the global Title blacklist. Thanks.

Blocking the account after creation would probably solve several problems, but would require a major change... In the task I just closed as duplicate, I had proposed to use the block ID like for autoblocks, but I guess that wouldn't be easy, and could possibly leave some info leak. Any solution to this is likely related to [T213982#4888012](/T213982#4888012).

So, I tried to think about possible solutions. We could certainly do something like [T152394#4888162](/T152394#4888162), i.e. implement a custom system resembling autoblocks. However, that would (probably) require a major effort, and would end up duplicating some DatabaseBlock logic. Hence, the alternative is to *use* DatabaseBlock's logic. The idea being to call doAutoblock on the IP of the user. This brings us another problem: we don't have a "parent" block object referring to the user, because the account still has to be created. Which, in turn, would leave us with two alternatives:

1. As proposed above, we allow the account creation and issue the block afterwards; this way we can set an autoblock cleanly. This would definitely be saner and future-proof, BUT it has three disadvantages:
   1. We'd have to change the entry point, shifting away from the AuthenticationProvider. We'd probably have to use something like the LocalUserCreated hook.
   2. The account will be created anyway, and this is something that sometimes should **not** be allowed. For instance, if the username contains blasphemy, or is grossly insulting in any other way. And I believe that most of the account creation filters do that. Creating the account means more work for sysops who have to delete log entries.
   3. If the creation succeeds, we miss the chance to block further attempts. This is usually not important, but it could be in some edge cases. For example, suppose there's a SUL account still not attached to your wiki. For some reason, you want to forbid that specific person from attaching the account, and blocking any attempt. If the account is created, you cannot do that anymore. The example itself doesn't make much sense, but I hope it can at least give an idea of what I'm talking about.
2. A partly crazy idea: create a DatabaseBlock object referring to the yet-not-created account, and call doAutoblock on it without then inserting the main block. This is hackier, but if it works (and I still don't know if it does) it'd be a cheap solution.

For (1), I find (B) to be especially unacceptable. So, (2). Is it a hack? Sort of. Is it future-proof? Probably not. I think it's worth trying, at least to mitigate this very serious info leak.

Also, a side note. AbuseFilter tables still have to be switched to the actor style. While switching the abuse\_filter\_log table ([patch](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/mediawiki/extensions/AbuseFilter/+/459990/)), it was discovered that the task won't be easy: currently, there's a hack in place to hide IPs of account creators in the AbuseLog ([code](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/diffusion/EABF/browse/master/includes/AbuseFilterRunner.php%241154)). That could be avoided with solution 1 (although old entries will remain a problem).

I tried to hack the AF code a bit. What I did is: if the user is anon, add the following to the block created in doAbuseFilterBlock:

```
	$block->setHideName( true );
	$block->mAuto = true;
	$block->mParentBlockId = ????;//FIXME
```

and don't create the log entry below. The IP is blocked, the log says nothing about it, and the AbuseLog still says that the user was blocked. Nothing seems to explode, too. But there's a problem with the mParentBlockId: without setting it, the (auto)block won't be reported in Special:AutoblockList (hence, you cannot unblock); setting it to a bogus value will show the block there, but you won't be able to change it.

And that's expected, of course, given that we don't have a parent block.

OK, so I went for an alternative approach. If the user is anon (and this is an account creation), block the account being created (even if it doesn't exist), then autoblock the IP. This works: the IP is blocked, it appears in Special:AutoblockList, and not in public logs. But that's still a bit hacky.

Hence, a question for [@Anomie](/p/Anomie/), [@Tchanders](/p/Tchanders/), [@dmaza](/p/dmaza/): we're trying to put a block on a non-existing account. Especially given the new actor schema and the ongoing block refactoring, is that going to crash badly, or can we live with that?

Tentatively proposing a patch with the solution above:

T152394.patch4 KB[Download](https://phab.wmfusercontent.org/file/download/u75dojurajxbkbr2xfqa/PHID-FILE-z5zpwiza6i52zhtd3zzw/T152394.patch)

Aside from blocking a non-existing user, two remarks:

* Maybe we should make it easier for checkusers to find the autoblock. Maybe writing it somewhere in the log entry, or next to the "block" checkbox, or something like that. Otherwise, an IP (or even a range) might be blocked without any log pointing to the block.
* The method is currently hacky: it swaps the target and builds an autoblock in place. That should probably be factored out, having a different method for autoblock, maybe one for rangeblocks, and accepting a different format as the target (and maybe all methods could use the same internal method to build a block object). I've left this as @fixme to keep the security patch short.

I think it's still a bit early to start a review without an answer to my question above, but CC [@Huji](/p/Huji/) and [@matej\_suchanek](/p/matej_suchanek/) for a preliminary look.

The actor change specifically didn't change ipb\_address to use the actor table, since the target of a block need not be an actor. An IP range was the specific non-actor target considered when doing that, but a not[-yet]-registered user name would also be a non-actor. I can't speak to the rest of the block refactoring, beyond noting that [T228077](/T228077) was declined.

Meh, yes. This bug is pretty simple to discover, and yet very serious. I know that it's been sitting there for 3+ years, but I'm tempted to set UBN. Even a hack (blocking a non-existing account) would be fine for now.

Thanks for the details [@Daimona](/p/Daimona/) - here are some thoughts about those two solutions.

**Set a block against a non-existent account**

I'd advise against allowing blocks to be set against targets that aren't considered valid (in this case a string that doesn't map to an existing account name or valid IP address/range). Blocks with invalid targets would behave unpredictably - e.g. once the block has been made against the non-existent account, it won't be possible to alter it via the UI or API, since they will reject the updated block for having an invalid target.

It seems odd to me that it is even possible to make such a block via DatabaseBlock::insert; it seems that that method should either check the target validity (and the validity of other fields), or only be callable from somewhere that has already checked validity.

This part of the blocking code is still rather disorganised - the target validation is done via SpecialBlock::validateTarget, but should really be somewhere more generic than the special page.

**Let the account be created and block it**

From the blocking perspective this is more "correct", since it works within the existing rules - but, as mentioned above, it depends whether the downsides of allowing the account to be created are acceptable.

> We could certainly do something like [T152394#4888162](/T152394#4888162), i.e. implement a custom system resembling autoblocks. However, that would (probably) require a major effort, and would end up duplicating some DatabaseBlock logic. Hence, the alternative is to use DatabaseBlock's logic.

I'd just note that the autoblocking functionality in DatabaseBlock doesn't really belong in that class. Ideally, DatabaseBlock should represent the block stored in the database, whereas inserting, deleting, autoblocking, etc. should really be done via a separate service ([T221075](/T221075)), to be reused by different types of block that need that behaviour.

Thanks, very appreciated!

Heh, I admit it's not pretty. Of note, we're already doing that for account autocreations (not just creations), according to T234164. But I do recognize that it's very hacky. My question, for now, is whether we can tolerate this hackiness in the short term, to stop leaking PI, then think about a longer-term solution in a public task. Noting that such a solution is probably not immediate, and could require some time.

> e.g. once the block has been made against the non-existent account, it won't be possible to alter it via the UI or API, since they will reject the updated block for having an invalid target.

In theory, there's no need to do that, the idea being that people are only supposed to remove the autoblock (which I tested and it works). Of course, we need to tell people about this, and smashing an uncaught exception or a mysterious error in their face is not a pretty way to do that.

> It seems odd to me that it is even possible to make such a block via DatabaseBlock::insert; it seems that that method should either check the target validity (and the validity of other fields), or only be callable from somewhere that has already checked validity.

Yes, it's indeed possible, and I agree that it should check the validity of the target. I can open a separate task for that if you want. But again, note that it won't work out of the box, especially as long as AF keeps blocking non-existent people for account autocreation.

> **Let the account be created and block it**
>
> From the blocking perspective this is more "correct", since it works within the existing rules - but, as mentioned above, it depends whether the downsides of allowing the account to be created are acceptable.

Yeah, and I honestly think it's not acceptable. IMHO, if a filter is set to block the person creating an account, that's because an account with a given name should not exist. And even if this may not have been the original intent of previous AF maintainers, I think this is now a de facto standard, since we got people used to the fact that an AF block on account creation means the account is not even created.

> I'd just note that the autoblocking functionality in DatabaseBlock doesn't really belong in that class. Ideally, DatabaseBlock should represent the block stored in the database, whereas inserting, deleting, autoblocking, etc. should really be done via a separate service ([T221075](/T221075)), to be reused by different types of block that need that behaviour.

Interesting. Yes, that would help.

---

So... Aside from the temporary hack, let me recap the acceptance criteria for a longer-term solution and see if you or anyone else may have a better idea.

**Notes:** This applies to account (auto)creations; [relevant code](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/diffusion/EABF/browse/master/includes/AbuseFilterRunner.php%241059-1109) for AF blocks.

* The IP of the account creator should not be disclosed; this applies to:
  + Special:Log/block
  + Special:Contribution for the IP
  + Special:Blocklist
  + Querying the ipblocks table

-> AFAIK, the Block logic should handle all of them at the same time.

* Nevertheless, the IP address should be blocked with the specified duration
* The block should be removable, still without disclosing the target (e.g. from Special:AutoblockList)
* The account creation should not succeed

New version of the hacky patch using autoblocks, note that it depends on <https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/mediawiki/extensions/AbuseFilter/+/539848/>.

At this point, given that we're already (unintendedly) blocking a non-existing target for autocreations, and the seriousness of this bug vs how easy it is to spot, I'd suggest to go with this hacky solution, and then discuss a proper one publicly.

Uh, it has an undeclared variable. Here is the updated version, but it still fails. When trying to publish an RC entry for the block, it will try to create an actor for it, and that will fail :-[

Looking at this task again, I can't see any easy solution. Allowing the account creation and blocking afterwards is something that I don't really want to implement. However, I think there's a very simple solution for the present issue: hiding the target from the block log before publishing the entry. This should be a one-liner, or very close to that. There'd be no associated entry in the deletion log, but I don't think this is a problem. The deletion level would be oversight-level.

It obviously wouldn't fix the underlying issue (i.e. that AF pretends that a user exists here, complicating other things such as the actor migration), but again, it would fix the immediate issue. Patch coming.

Huh, I spoke too soon... It wouldn't be a one-liner; there are two main issues to be resolved first:

* The AF code for blocks doesn't know whether the current action is an account creation. This can be easily resolved by passing a parameter to BlockingConsequence::\_\_construct.
* Core's BlockUser doesn't allow altering the log entry. Also, I don't know whether it's possible to easily retrieve the entry after it's been published and oversight it later, but I don't want to do that because it would still be published unhidden. CC [@Tchanders](/p/Tchanders/) and [@Urbanecm](/p/Urbanecm/) for the recent work on BlockUser -- how do you think a caller should be allowed to modify a log entry before it's published? Or, for the limited use case outlined here, do you think we might add a setter to BlockUser, e.g. setLogEntryDeleted( int $flags )?

I would suggest making the block action not work when action is related to account creation. That would solve the immediate security issue, without also affecting a lot of usecases -- personally I don't think this is actually used anywhere, and if it is, it's probably not a large amount of projects.

To be honest, I don't think BlockUser should be responsible for suppressing the log entries out of sudden, I don't see such a concept elsewhere in MW. If we want to take that path, I would suggest oversighting the log entry using some other service (which can be created if there's not one already).

However, a nicer solution might be imitating core's autoblock functionality -- not sure, but it sounds core's block classes might be extended, and altered from extensions providing alternative blocking mechanisms? We could make the action work more like an autoblock, which isn't logged, and the IP is not exposed (MW exposes block ID instead).

I don't have hard data, but it is certainly used. I can count 7 such filters on itwiki, and I believe there are others on other wikis. Disabling the feature would effectively introduce a loss of functionality.

If we want to take that path, I would suggest oversighting the log entry using some other service (which can be created if there's not one already).

The problem is, this isn't possible. BlockUser::log creates a ManualLogEntry, sets data, inserts the entry, and publishes it. Deletion should happen in between creation and insertion (at least for our use case), but BlockUser doesn't offer any hook inside log(). Note, however, that it wouldn't be complicated to delete the entry. I might commit a POC on gerrit, but the base idea is:

BlockUser
```
private $logDeletionFlags;

/**
 * @param int $flags One of LogPage::* constants
 */
public function setLogDeletionFlags( int $flags ) : void { // Alternatively, it might be a constructor option inside $blockOptions instead of a setter, perhaps even better
    $this->logDeletionFlags = $flags;
}

private function log( DatabaseBlock $block, bool $isReblock ) {
     // ...
    if ( $this->logDeletionFlags !== null ) {
        $logEntry->setDeleted( $this->logDeletionFlags );
    }
    // ...
```

We could make the action work more like an autoblock, which isn't logged, and the IP is not exposed (MW exposes block ID instead).

This would indeed be a great idea. However, my previous investigation (see [T152394#5496287](/T152394#5496287) and following comments, might be outdated in theory, but it's probably not) revealed that MW core doesn't support "stand-alone autoblocks", that is, autoblocks without a "parent" block. This is a feature that might be implemented, but it wouldn't be as easy as deleting the log entry. Perhaps implement the log-deletion solution, mark it as @internal, and then refactor autoblocks after this task is resolved?

Hmm, good points, [@Daimona](/p/Daimona/). We can add a hook to modify the log object I guess. What about changing BlockUser to allow suppression in Gerrit (I can review quickly), and then using it (as a security patch) in AF?

The problem with a hook is that it would be more like a long-term solution. A setter might be marked as @internal until a better solution is implemented. That said, review should certainly happen on gerrit, and I'd like to also hear the opinion by [@Tchanders](/p/Tchanders/) or anybody else on the AHT team per Developers/Maintainers. Anyway, both solutions work for me.

### GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 2, June 1991

```

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<<https://fsf.org/>>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

```
#### Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

#### TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

**0.**
This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

**1.**
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

**2.**
You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

**a)**
You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

**b)**
You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

**c)**
If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

**3.**
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

**a)**
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

**b)**
Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

**c)**
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

**4.**
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

**5.**
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

**6.**
Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

**7.**
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

**8.**
If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

**9.**
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

**10.**
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

**NO WARRANTY**

**11.**
BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

**12.**
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

#### END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

#### How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

```

one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.
Copyright (C) yyyy  name of author

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, see
<<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>>.

```

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

```

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.

```

The hypothetical commands ``show w'` and ``show c'` should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than ``show w'` and
``show c'`; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever
suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

```

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
interest in the program `Gnomovision'
(which makes passes at compilers) written
by James Hacker.

signature of Moe Ghoul, 1 April 1989
Moe Ghoul, President of Vice

```

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library. If this is what you want to do, use the
[GNU Lesser General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html)
instead of this License.

The [Terms of Use for Wikimedia Foundation Projects](/wiki/Special%3AMyLanguage/Policy%3ATerms_of_Use "Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Terms of Use") govern your use of [phabricator.wikimedia.org](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/ "phab:"). In addition:

1. **Code to Which You Hold the Copyright**: When you submit software source code, or other material intended for inclusion in software (such as documentation or translations), to which you hold the copyright, you agree to license it under the GNU General Public License (version 2.0 or any later version). The only exception is if the software to which you are contributing requires a different license. In that case, you agree to license any text you contribute under that particular license. For example, at the publication of this version of the Phabricator Terms of Use, Visual Editor is licensed under the MIT license, so if you make contributions to Visual Editor through this site, you agree to license those contributions under the MIT license.
2. **Importing Code**: You may import source code that you have found elsewhere or that you have co-authored with others, but in such case you warrant that the source code is available under terms that are [compatible with the GNU General Public License](//www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses) version 2.0 (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by that software).
3. **Etiquette**: You are expected to follow the [guidelines](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special%3AMyLanguage/Bug_management/Phabricator_etiquette "mw:Special:MyLanguage/Bug management/Phabricator etiquette") to ensure that Phabricator is a productive and collaborative environment for managing bug reports and feature requests.
