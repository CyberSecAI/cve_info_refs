Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31222:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control in SES Evolution versions prior to 2.1.0. Specifically, it allows unauthorized modification of security policies through a local attack vector.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The core issue is that SES Evolution doesn't adequately restrict which processes can modify security policy components if the attacker has access to a system with the SES administration console installed.
*   **Policy Modification:** An attacker can update scripts that are part of the security policy. These scripts are used for various purposes, including detecting malicious actions or determining the security policy to be applied.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious code into security policy scripts, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution when the updated policy is deployed and the script is run.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** The attacker has high impacts on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, by modifying the script of an existing security policy, which will be used the next time changes are deployed to the environment.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Adjacent Network:** An attacker on the same network as a machine with the SES console installed can leverage the vulnerability.
*   **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on a computer that has the SES Evolution management console installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be on the same network segment as a machine running the SES Evolution console.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user into executing a malicious program on the machine where the SES console is installed.
*   **No Privileges Required**: No special privileges are needed to carry out this attack.
*   **Access to the Console Machine**: The attacker needs to execute a malicious program on a system where the SES Evolution administration console is installed.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.1 (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
* A proof-of-concept exploit exists.
* The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.1.0 of SES Evolution.
* There is no workaround for this vulnerability.
