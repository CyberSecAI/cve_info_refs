### @nmeum **[nmeum](/nmeum)** commented [Oct 30, 2020](#issue-733078546)

#### Contribution description

The following bounds check performed in `sock_dns` is IMHO incorrect:

[RIOT/sys/net/application\_layer/dns/dns.c](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/1de14931b8a326d12e35685bad1fd4779848401f/sys/net/application_layer/dns/dns.c#L128-L130)

Lines 128 to 130
in
[1de1493](/RIOT-OS/RIOT/commit/1de14931b8a326d12e35685bad1fd4779848401f)

|  | if ((bufpos + RR\_TYPE\_LENGTH + RR\_CLASS\_LENGTH + RR\_TTL\_LENGTH) >= buflim) { |
| --- | --- |
|  | return -EBADMSG; |
|  | } |

It does not take into account that after the `bufpos` is advanced by `RR_TYPE_LENGTH`, `RR_CLASS_LENGTH`, and `RR_TTL_LENGTH` two bytes are read unconditionally using the `_get_short` function in the following line:

[RIOT/sys/net/application\_layer/dns/dns.c](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/1de14931b8a326d12e35685bad1fd4779848401f/sys/net/application_layer/dns/dns.c#L137)

Line 137
in
[1de1493](/RIOT-OS/RIOT/commit/1de14931b8a326d12e35685bad1fd4779848401f)

|  | unsigned addrlen = ntohs(\_get\_short(bufpos)); |
| --- | --- |

This is currently not taken into account by the bounds check, thus resulting in a potential out-of-bounds buffer access by a maximum of two bytes.

#### Testing procedure

The easiest way to confirm this issue is using the following application:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <panic.h>

#include <net/af.h>

extern int _parse_dns_reply(uint8_t *buf, size_t len, void *addr_out, int family);

static uint8_t buf[] = {
	0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 255, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 192, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
	0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
	0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
};

int main(void)
{
    void *addr;
    uint8_t addr_buf[16];

    addr = &addr_buf[0];
    _parse_dns_reply(buf, sizeof(buf), addr, AF_UNSPEC);

    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
    return 0;
}
```

**Attention:** This application passes data directly to `_parse_dns_reply`, for this reason the static keyword must be removed from the `_parse_dns_reply` function in `sys/net/application_layer/dns/dns.c`.

Afterwards, compile the application with:

```
$ make BOARD=native -C examples/sock_dns/ all-asan

```

And execute it with:

```
$ make BOARD=native -C examples/sock_dns/ term

```

This will result in the following error message:

```

```

With the proposed patch applied no error is detected by ASAN. I think the `_get_short` function should also be renamed to `_get_u16` and the issue could be avoided all together by passing buffer bounds to `_get_u16` and checking these bounds before performing the access in this function.

#### Issues/PRs references

The incorrect check was introduced in [#10740](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/10740) for fixing [#10739](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/issues/10739).

| ACK. I can reproduce the steps the testing procedures in `master` and confirm that the ASAN error disappears when this PR is applied. For posterity, here is the minimal Makefile I used for the provided C-code (which I put in a sub-directory of `tests/`):  ``` include ../Makefile.tests_common  USEMODULE += sock_dns USEMODULE += sock_udp USEMODULE += gnrc_nettype_ipv6  include $(RIOTBASE)/Makefile.include ``` |

Apart from advancing the buffer by RR_TYPE_LENGTH, RR_CLASS_LENGTH,

integer using _get_short(bufpos):

My ACK was missing ;-). I tested it and the fix fixes, what it is supposed to do. ACK
