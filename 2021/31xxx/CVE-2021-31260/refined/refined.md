The provided content relates to CVE-2021-31260.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the `MergeTrack` function within `src/isomedia/track.c`. This occurs due to the incorrect handling of `saio` and `saiz` variables when processing Sample Auxiliary Information (SAI) data in MP4 files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The code incorrectly assumes that `saio` and `saiz` pointers will always be valid when processing sample auxiliary information within a track fragment. If certain conditions aren't met (e.g., `saio->offsets` or `saio->entry_count` are not set), the code sets both to NULL and subsequently attempts to dereference them, leading to a null pointer dereference.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to a crash. The null pointer dereference would cause the application to terminate unexpectedly.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is crafted MP4 files, specifically those with manipulated or missing sample auxiliary information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted MP4 file that triggers the vulnerable code path within the `MergeTrack` function. This could be achieved by providing a malicious file to an application using the vulnerable library.

**Additional notes:**
- The commit `df8fffd` addresses the null dereference issue by adding a check before attempting to access the `saio->offsets` and `saio->entry_count`.
- The issue was reported in [issue #1736](https://github.com/gpac/gpac/issues/1736) and the fix was implemented on [Apr 8, 2021](https://github.com/gpac/gpac/commit/df8fffd839fe5ae9acd82d26fd48280a397411d9).
