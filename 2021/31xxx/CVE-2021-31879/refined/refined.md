Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31879:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that GNU Wget, when following HTTP redirects using the `-L` flag, improperly passes the `Authorization` header to the redirected URL, even if the redirect leads to a different origin (different host or port).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Origin Information Leakage:** Wget does not strip the Authorization header when redirecting to a different origin, which violates the principle of cross-origin security.
- **Improper Header Handling:** The vulnerability is due to the fact that Wget doesn't recognize when a redirect is considered cross-origin and inappropriately forwards the sensitive header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the potential disclosure of sensitive information contained in the Authorization header to an unintended third party. This information could be used to gain unauthorized access to protected resources.
- **Potential data modification/addition:** The NetApp advisory also mentions the possibility of data modification or addition, although this is less detailed in this content. It may be that the ability to pass authorization headers to arbitrary third-party servers allows for data modification if the third-party server allows it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Redirect Manipulation:** An attacker can control a server that the victim uses wget to access. The server can then redirect the user to a malicious server while still passing the authorization header.
- **Network Positioning:** An attacker could potentially act as a man-in-the-middle if the client is not using HTTPS and intercept the redirect request from the server and forward it to the malicious server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Control of a Redirect Server:** The attacker needs to control a server that can issue an HTTP redirect to a different origin.
- **Ability to Receive the Authorization Header:** The attacker needs a server that can receive and capture the Authorization header sent by the vulnerable wget client.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to initiate a `wget` request with the `-L` flag to a server that redirects to a different origin, and also use an `Authorization` header. The user is also required to make the initial `wget` request to the malicious actor's server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is similar to a known issue in cURL (CVE-2018-1000007), highlighting the commonality of this type of security flaw in HTTP clients.
- The provided NetApp advisory (NTAP-20210618-0002) specifically references this issue in the context of their products, noting that they are aware of public discussion around the vulnerability
- The advisory lists affected products, which are using the vulnerable version of wget.
- The advisory also provides remediation steps which includes upgrading or patching specific components to address the issue.
