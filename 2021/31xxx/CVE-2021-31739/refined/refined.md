**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The SEPPmail solution is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability because user input is not correctly encoded in HTML attributes when returned by the server. Specifically, the `subject` URL parameter is received, but not correctly encoded, and then re-embedded in the HTML page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper encoding of user input in HTML attributes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code in the domain under which SEPPmail runs (e.g., *securemail.example.org*) in the target's browser. This can be used to retrieve the target's username and password and send them to the attacker, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack is performed by crafting a malicious URL that contains HTML/JavaScript code in the `subject` parameter, and then tricking a target into clicking the crafted URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL, and trick a target into opening this URL. No special position or capabilities are needed beyond this. The attacker must also find a way to bypass the Content Security Policy to effectively exploit the XSS.
