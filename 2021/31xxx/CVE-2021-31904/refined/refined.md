Here's the extracted information:

**Vulnerability:** Potential XSS on the test history page in TeamCity. (TW-67710)

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is not explicitly mentioned but it's a cross-site scripting vulnerability, so it's due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input that is later rendered in the test history page.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting). The vulnerability lies in improper sanitization of data being rendered on the "test history page." This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts which are stored and executed in the browsers of other users viewing that page.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions including session hijacking, stealing cookies, defacing web pages, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
*  **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the TeamCity's test history page. An attacker would inject malicious javascript into a field/parameter that is then displayed on the test history page.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would require the ability to influence the data displayed in the TeamCity's test history page, implying some level of access or capability within the system.

The vulnerability was resolved in TeamCity version 2020.2.2.
