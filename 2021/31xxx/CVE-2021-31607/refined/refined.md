Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-31607:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Command injection vulnerability exists in the `snapper` module of SaltStack. The `_is_text_file` function in the `snapper` module uses `os.popen` to execute the `file` command with a filename passed directly to it, without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The direct use of `os.popen` with a filename controlled by the user allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands. Specifically, the filename is used unsafely in a shell context by `os.popen("file -bi {}".format(filename), "r").read()`
- **Insecure Function Call:** The `os.popen` function is known to be susceptible to command injection if its arguments are not properly sanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with the ability to create files on a Salt minion can escalate their privileges to root.
- **Remote Command Execution:** By crafting filenames to execute arbitrary commands on the minion, an attacker can achieve full remote command execution.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and System Availability:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the system and cause a loss of availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Filenames:** The primary attack vector is through the creation of a file with a malicious filename. This filename contains shell metacharacters (e.g., `$(command)`) that, when executed by `os.popen` leads to arbitrary command execution.
- **Salt Master Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when the Salt master calls the `snapper.diff` function on a minion.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File Creation on Minion:** The attacker must be able to create a file on a minion machine where the salt-minion process is running.
- **Salt Master Interaction:** The attacker needs the Salt master to call the `snapper.diff` function on the vulnerable minion.
