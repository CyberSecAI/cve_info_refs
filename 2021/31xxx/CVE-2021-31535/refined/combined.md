Subject: libX11 security advisory: May 18, 2021

X.Org libX11 security advisory: May 18, 2021

Missing request length checks in libX11
=======================================

CVE-2021-31535

XLookupColor() and other X libraries function lack proper validation
of the length of their string parameters. If those parameters can be
controlled by an external application (for instance a color name that
can be emitted via a terminal control sequence) it can lead to the
emission of extra X protocol requests to the X server.

Patch
-----

A patch for XLookupColor() and other potentially vulnerable functions
has been committed to libX11. libX11 1.7.1 will be released shortly
and contains a fix for this issue.

<https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11>

commit: 8d2e02ae650f00c4a53deb625211a0527126c605

    Reject string longer than USHRT_MAX before sending them on the wire

XTerm version 367 contains extra validation for the length of color
names passed to XLookupColor() from terminal control sequences.  XTerm
version 366 and earlier are vulnerable.

Tests conducted by Roman Fiedler on other terminal emulator
applications have not found other cases of passing un-checked color
names to XLookupColor().

Thanks
======

This vulnerability has been discovered by Roman Fiedler from
Unparalleled IT Services e.U.

Subject: libx11 API Protocol Command Injection

Hello list,

Due to missing request length checks in libX11 injection of X
protocol commands is possible, e.g. by using long color names
in color lookup API calls. The color names in some cases may
be (remotely) attacker controlled, e.g. when xterm receives OCS
(operating system command sequences) from an SSH session to
a compromised server or a careless "tail -f" on a log file containing
OCS. A crafted OCS color name can be used to disable X server
authentication, mess up the keyboard layout, ...

Luckily only very few data flow pathes were found to trigger
such bogus color lookup calls. Color specifications in PDF, HTML,
SVG, ... were not suitable to reach the API in a problematic way
for those applications tested.

See the attached UNPAR-2021-1 advisory or the blog entry describing
how exploitation works in detail:

<https://unparalleled.eu/blog/2021/20210518-using-xterm-to-navigate-the-huge-color-space/>

X.Org libX11 security advisory: May 18, 2021

Missing request length checks in libX11
=======================================

CVE-2021-31535

XLookupColor() and other X libraries function lack proper validation
of the length of their string parameters. If those parameters can be
controlled by an external application (for instance a color name that
can be emitted via a terminal control sequence) it can lead to the
emission of extra X protocol requests to the X server.

Patch
-----

A patch for XLookupColor() and other potentially vulnerable functions
has been committed to libX11. libX11 1.7.1 will be released shortly
and contains a fix for this issue.

<https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11>

commit: 8d2e02ae650f00c4a53deb625211a0527126c605

    Reject string longer than USHRT_MAX before sending them on the wire

XTerm version 367 contains extra validation for the length of color
names passed to XLookupColor() from terminal control sequences.  XTerm
version 366 and earlier are vulnerable.

Tests conducted by Roman Fiedler on other terminal emulator
applications have not found other cases of passing un-checked color
names to XLookupColor().

Thanks

# Using Xterm to Navigate the Huge Color Space

An interesting, and probably very old (1986?) flaw in libX11
allow crafted color names to mess up the client-server communication
protocol and inject malicious X server requests. The flaw is
comparable to SQLi injecting commands into database connections
granting an attacker access to all features of the connection
protocol. Searching for the root cause and also the origin of
the problematic code turned into an excursion into software
archeology.

Looking back to the early age of computer graphics, color
space was quite limited due to the small
[color depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth)
with ancient hard- and software. Often the whole color space was
reduced to just black/white (1 bit), 16 colors (4 bits), later
8 or 16 bits. Even being a child of those times the early
[X-window system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System)
protocol specification considered way bigger color spaces, e.g.
by allowing 16 bit color depth per color channel in AllocColor,
see
[X.V11R1.tar.gz](https://www.x.org/releases/X11R1/X.V11R1.tar.gz)
from 1987, file *doc/Protocol/spec*.

3896 AllocColor
3897 cmap: COLORMAP
3898 red, green, blue: CARD16
3899 =>
3900 pixel: CARD32
3901 red, green, blue: CARD16
3902
3903 Errors: Colormap, Alloc
3904
3905 Allocates a read-only colormap entry corresponding
to the closest RGB

Also Xterm, a simple graphical terminal, is of similar age
and it was even maintained together with the ancient xfree86
X implementation, see a CVS commit entry from 19970618
[changelog](https://web.archive.org/web/20070101220948/http%3A//cvsweb.xfree86.org/cvsweb/xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/CHANGELOG)
(older resources should exist, but I cold not locate them).

Revision 3.491 / (view) - annotate - [select for diffs] , Wed Jun 18 07:25:49 1997 UTC (9 years, 6 months ago) by dawes
Branch: MAIN
Changes since 3.490: +6 -2 lines
Diff to previous 3.490
more xterm termcap updates

While being that old, still the procolol specification, a
free server implementation (now Xorg) and even Xterm still exist
and are maintained.

# Exploring the Color Space Using OSCs

Even with *AllocColor* having 48 bits to specifiy a color,
quite some hardware back then could only produce 16 different
colors using a fixed palette instead of a per-pixel RGB color.
The palette could be changed but therefore different programs
sharing a screen via the X server for output had to negotiate
the colors on the palette or the server had to tell, which are
the colors available looking similar to the specification. The
X protocol helped to do that by providing the *AllocColor*
but also the *LookupColor* request. The later could be used
to lookup a color by name.

LookupColor
1 92 opcode
1 unused
2 3+(n+p)/4 request length
4 COLORMAP cmap
2 n length of name
2 unused
n STRING8 name | opcode, x, len
p unused, p=pad(n)

Graphical terminals like Xterm, Rxvt, ... use(d) exactly such
requests to negotiate the color then used to display graphical
output. But they did this not only for themselves but also for
programs run by the terminal. To allow hilighting of text output,
programs can emit terminal control sequences to change the color
or font. The terminal will react to the control sequences, select
an appropriate color and paint the program output using X protocol
requests sent to the graphics server. For example
*ls --color=always /home* creates a colored directory listing:

$ ls --color=always /home | xxd
00000000: 1b5b 306d 1b5b 3031 3b33 346d 7465 7374 .[0m.[01;34mtest
00000010: 1b5b 306d 0a .[0m.

While the terminal control sequence used by *ls* may
only select a predefined color,
[OSCs (Operating System Command Sequences)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#OSC_(Operating_System_Command)_sequences)
allow requesting any color by name or RGB specification, e.g.
using those Python3 commands:

sys.stdout.buffer.write(b'\x07\x1b]11;purple4\x07')
sys.stdout.buffer.write(b'\x07\x1b]11;#006f00015858\x07')

The color *#006f00015858* is just a nice dark blue and
is submitted to the X server using an *AllocColor* request.
The full X protocol packet data is:

[op] [length][colormap id ][red ][green ][blue ][pad ]
\x54\x75\x04\x00\x20\x00\x00\x00\x6f\x00\x01\x00\x58\x58\x00\x65
[op][mo][length][next X frame ..

The 0x54 is the opcode (AllocColor), 0x04 the length of the packet
(0x4 \* 4 bytes), then color map id and the color specification
*\x6f\x00\x01\x00\x58\x58\x00\x65*. But the color specification
itself (without the AllocColor header) would also be a valid
X protocol request, but one for *SetAccessControl*. With
mode set to 0 it will grant anyone access to the X server session,
also key loggers, screen shot tools, ...:

SetAccessControl
1 111 opcode (0x6f)
1 mode
0 Disable
1 Enable
2 1 request length

# Enjoying Exotic Colors With Loooong Names

Using the control sequence *b'\x07\x1b]11;purple4\x07'*
allows color lookup by name. Emiting such sequence to Xterm will
cause Xterm to perform a *LookupColor* X protocol request
with the given name:

LookupColor
1 92 opcode
1 unused
2 3+(n+p)/4 request length
4 COLORMAP cmap
2 n length of name
2 unused
n STRING8 name
p unused, p=pad(n)

As there is no maximum OSC (operating system control) sequence
length specified (at least I did not find any limits), Xterm takes
whatever the program run inside Xterm requests. As the Xterm C program
code uses *size\_t* (64 bit on amd64 architecture), Xterm
might allocate memory for color names many GBs large. Such long
names may exhaust computer RAM in general, but XTerm itself is
not harmed by it (unless OOM-killer is triggered). But when submitting
such long names via the X protocol, the [CARD16] packet length
(4 bytes per unit) will overflow but nevertheless the full packet
data is transmitted. Therefore the X-server handles a truncated
*LookupColor* packet. The part of the color name that did
not fit in the packet is treated as subsequent X protocol request.
See *libx11/libx11-1.7.0/src/LookupCol.c* how the request
packet is created:

35 Status
36 XLookupColor (
37 register Display \*dpy,
38 Colormap cmap,
39 \_Xconst char \*spec,
40 XColor \*def,
41 XColor \*scr)
...
81 n = (int) strlen (spec);
82 LockDisplay(dpy);
83 GetReq (LookupColor, req);
84 req->cmap = cmap;
85 req->nbytes = n;
86 req->length += (n + 3) >> 2;
87 Data (dpy, spec, (long)n);
88 if (!\_XReply (dpy, (xReply \*) &reply, 0, xTrue)) {

Thus looking up an overlong color name allows injection of
arbitrary X protocol requests with user controlled data and most
likely loss of correct reading frame on the connection. The OSC
data may contain only printable characters as color name. With
such data it is not possible to inject e.g. a valid *SetAccessControl*
packet directly. But other valid X protocol requests can be injected
that consume not only data from the botched *LookupColor*
request but also the first 8 bytes of a following *AllocColor*
X protocol request. Due to the loss of the reading frame, the
RGB color specification data is then executed as a separate X
request with fully user controlled data. The server will process
it and disable any X server authentication as requested.

The PoC <enjoy-all-the-colors.py>
also injects a *ChangeKeyboardMapping* request (configuration
option) to mess up the keyboard map (making the keyboard unusable).
The *SetAccessControl* request then turns of X-server authentication
as can be seen by "xhost". If the attacker for any reason can
reach the X-server socket he can then take full control of the
logged on user session and usually execute code as that user.
Another interesting X protocol request to inject is the
*XTestFakeInput* request to inject keystrokes to "type"
shell commands in the terminal.

The PoC disabled access control in 10/10 attempts while
keymap messup plus access requests worked only 5/10 attempts
in the testing environment.

$ xhost
access control enabled, only authorized clients can connect
SI:localuser:test
$ xterm -e ./enjoy-all-the-colors.py
xterm: warning, error event received:
X Error of failed request: BadFont (invalid Font parameter)
Major opcode of failed request: 48 (X\_QueryTextExtents)
Resource id in failed request: 0x54545454
Serial number of failed request: 312
Current serial number in output stream: 312
$ xhost
access control disabled, clients can connect from any host
SI:localuser:test

The exploit also works when the control sequences are embedded
in log files, then (hazardously) displayed using *cat* or
*tail -f*. Also running the PoC via SSH on a remote host
will disable authentication on the **local** host.

$ xhost
access control enabled, only authorized clients can connect
SI:localuser:test
$ xterm -e tail -f x.out
xterm: warning, error event received:
...
$ xhost
access control disabled, clients can connect from any host

# All Fun Comes To an End

Meanwhile patches were released. Upstream patches in libX11-1.7.1
make various requests with oversized string data fail with an
error without attempting to transmit the data to the server. See
[libx11 git commit 8d2e02ae650f00c4a53deb625211a0527126c605](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11).

A mitigation patch was also to xterm
([patch #367](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.log.html))
to ignore GB-sized color name requests in control sequences.

X.Org libX11 security advisory: May 18, 2021

Missing request length checks in libX11
=======================================

CVE-2021-31535

XLookupColor() and other X libraries function lack proper validation
of the length of their string parameters. If those parameters can be
controlled by an external application (for instance a color name that
can be emitted via a terminal control sequence) it can lead to the
emission of extra X protocol requests to the X server.

Patch
-----

A patch for XLookupColor() and other potentially vulnerable functions
has been committed to libX11. libX11 1.7.1 will be released shortly
and contains a fix for this issue.

<https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11>

commit: 8d2e02ae650f00c4a53deb625211a0527126c605

    Reject string longer than USHRT_MAX before sending them on the wire

XTerm version 367 contains extra validation for the length of color
names passed to XLookupColor() from terminal control sequences.  XTerm
version 366 and earlier are vulnerable.

Tests conducted by Roman Fiedler on other terminal emulator
applications have not found other cases of passing un-checked color
names to XLookupColor().

Thanks

This vulnerability has been discovered by Roman Fiedler from
Unparalleled IT Services e.U.

libx11 API Protocol Command Injection
=====================================
Advisory: UNPAR-2021-1
Component: libx11
Vendor: X.Org Foundation (https://x.org/)
Version(s): unclear, maybe since X10R2 or X10R3 [1] (Jan, Feb 1986)
Weakness(es): Inappropriate Encoding for Output Context (CWE-838)
CVE: CVE-2021-31535
CVSS: Base score 9.3: AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
Author: Roman Fiedler
Summary:
========
The X Window System is a client-server based windowing system
common on Unix-like systems. Using the communication protocol
defined by the X protocol specification enables clients to perform
output of graphical data, receive keyboard and mouse input, change
shared properties affecting window manager behaviour.
To ease development of graphical client software, libX11 [2]
provides a C-API for invoking X server functions remotely. The
libX11 library itself makes use of the XCB library (X protocol
C-language Binding) [3] to encode the data structures for transport
and to facilitate transmission of requests, parsing of responses.
The libX11 request "XLookupColor" intended for server side color
lookup contains a flaw allowing to a client to send color name
requests with a color name longer than the maximum size allowed
by the protocol and also the maximal packet size for normalsized
packets. The user-controlled data exceeding the maximum size
is then interpreted by the server as additional X protocol requests
and executed, e.g. to disable X server authorization completely.
Timeline:
\* 20210212: Contacted XOrg and Xterm
\* 20210316: Refined XOrg patch available
\* 20210326: Mitigation on xterm side in patch #367 [4]
\* 20210518: Disclosure
Details:
========
The X Window System Protocol specification, release 6.8 [5],
page 72 and 168 defines a request and encoding to query the server
for the color specification of a given color name and the closest
specification supported by the hardware. This function was maybe
historically intended for optimizing color palette use while
full 16-bit RGB color hardware was not available or to improve
optimal color selection for ancient monitors.
The protocol encoding of the LookupColor request is:
byte(s) value meaning
1 92 opcode
1 unused
2 3+(n+p)/4 request length
4 COLORMAP cmap
2 n length of name
2 unused
n STRING8 name
p unused, p=pad(n)
As seen the name length may not exceed 2^16 bytes, the request
length itself 2^18 bytes. The code of the Xlib client API function
does not honor that:
35 Status
36 XLookupColor (
37 register Display \*dpy,
38 Colormap cmap,
39 \_Xconst char \*spec,
40 XColor \*def,
41 XColor \*scr)
...
81 n = (int) strlen (spec);
82 LockDisplay(dpy);
83 GetReq (LookupColor, req);
84 req->cmap = cmap;
85 req->nbytes = n;
86 req->length += (n + 3) >> 2;
87 Data (dpy, spec, (long)n);
88 if (!\_XReply (dpy, (xReply \*) &reply, 0, xTrue)) {
Therefore providing a color name longer than 2^18 bytes will
overflow both the name length and request length fields. Thus
the server will parse and execute a lookup request shorter than
intended by the client. The remaining unprocessed color name
data is then immediately executed as additional request(s) due
to the asynchronous nature of the the protocol.
Impact:
=======
When triggering an X client application to perform a LookupColor
request with a crafted color name, protocol command injection
will result. The impact of this is from loss of procotol reading
frame, thus client application abort when the synchronization
error is detected (DoS) to deactivation of X server access control.
When the later happens, the attacker takes full control of the
graphics server communication including keyboard and mouse input
data and therefore can instruct other X applications, e.g. graphical
terminals to execute arbitrary keyboard input (RCE).
Vulnerable Systems:
===================
As the vulnerability is triggered by a client application submitting
overlong color names to Xlib but there is no common pattern,
why or how an application would do that, the number of vulnerable
configurations is hard to estimate. Even for a plain Debian codebase
search for XLookupColor [6] there are more than 200 hits, some
of them being not applications but libraries or components used
in more complex software, e.g. the mono environment. Following
two examples illustrate, how different an attack path can be:
1) xterm:
xterm supports operating system command sequences (OCS) [7] to
change the background or font color. Unlike other requests, e.g.
to modify window properties, color requests are not deemed risky
and therefore are executed by xterm. By adding a crafted OCS e.g.
to a logfile that is then mindlessly displayed by plain "cat"
(a user error) but also when connecting via SSH to a remote and
maybe less trusted server, that prints the malicious OCS embedded
in remote ".profile" or ".bashrc", the OCS will inject X protocol
data on the LOCAL host running xterm, even when X forwarding
is disabled for SSH.
The tool "enjoy-all-the-colors.py" [8] demonstrates such an attack,
where the injected command will disable X server authorization
completely. Afterwards an attacker being able to reach one X
server control socket, e.g. UNIX-domain "/tmp/.X11-unix/X0" or
TCP port 6000 (when X server was started without "-nolisten tcp"),
can then take full control of the screen session of the currently
connected user. The effect on the X server can be seen running
"xhost" before and after invoking "enjoy-all-the-colors.py".
2) Modification of ".Xdefaults":
Adding malicious color names as generated by "enjoy-all-the-colors.py"
to the .Xdefaults causes applications processing such settings
to execute injected X commands on startup. This can be shown e.g.
by setting the property "x11-ssh-askpass.Background" and then
run "/usr/lib/ssh/x11-ssh-askpass":
$ python3 -c 'print("x11-ssh-askpass.Background:\tAAAA" + "A"\*(1<<18))' >> .Xdefaults
$ /usr/lib/ssh/x11-ssh-askpass --help
Warning: Color name "AAAAAA...
X Error of failed request: BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
Major opcode of failed request: 65 (X\_PolyLine)
Value in failed request: 0x41
Serial number of failed request: 16
Current serial number in output stream: 16
To detect entrypoints or make it easier to estimate if an application
is vulnerable, the "x-proto-sniffer.py" [9] was created. It intercepts
X requests, downgrades the connection, e.g. by disabling the shared
memory extension, to ease following the command flow and watches
out for e.g. XColorLookup requests. Due to its invasive nature,
the behaviour of the subject under test is modified, the X application
may react flaky and thus the results may only give hints to dig
deeper but they shall not been seen as an audit report declaring
an application to be secure.
Mitigation:
===========
While fixes are not applied yet, xterm should not be used to
display less trusted data, e.g. from SSH connections to less
trusted remote machines.
To avoid attacks via .Xdefaults on kiosk type machines, where
graphical user has no permission to execute arbitrary operating
system commands or sometimes not even to send hardware keyboard
keystrokes, the .Xdefaults must not be modifiable by the user.
But also changing of "HOME" environment variable to an untrusted
location has to be prevented.
Fix:
====
x.org provided patches to refuse processing of request data longer
than the maximum request size and return 0 (color not found). See
commit 8d2e02ae650f00c4a53deb625211a0527126c605 in [12].
In parallel xterm patch #367 [4] disables processing of nearly
arbitrary long OCS strings, thus preventing remote X command
injection via e.g. SSH even on systems with Xlib not (yet) patched.
Proof of Concept:
=================
The tool "enjoy-all-the-colors.py" [8] creates an xterm OCS sequence
containing a color name, that when sent via Xlib XLookupColor
will be seen as 3-4 different requests:
\* a (truncated) XLookupColor request
\* two XQueryTextExtents requests of different size consuming
most of the remaining color data
\* the start of an "SetAccessControl" command with the complete
request data frame not consisting only of color name data but
also the first few bytes of the next successive non-rogue client
request. Only the data of the next request contains the required
bytes otherwise forbidden in the color name that are needed
to form a sane "SetAccessControl" comand to disable authorization.
See [10] for more information on the attack method itself.
Notes:
======
From historic perspective it would be interesting, from when
on the bug was really exploitable. The code in "XGetColor.c"
of [1] seems vulnerable. The source code comment is older,
the copyright seems to have been added 1985 already, so maybe
X10R2 or older. As a 256kb long color name is not a big thing
nowadays, other parts of the historic X protocol implementation
may have caused memory allocations of such size to fail or not
to be processed in an exploitable way due to other limits.
Therefore a software stack as described in [11] would be interesting
to test X server behaviour in realistic 1985/1986 environment.
There was not way found yet to get hold of such a stack with
acceptable effort yet.
Credits:
========
Thanks to Thomas Dickey to add mitigation code to xterm by shortening
color name length before passing it on to Xlib and x.org developers,
especially Matthieu Herrb for analyzing the problem on Xlib side
and providing patches not only for the XLookupColor vector but
also other similar requests, even when no way of exploitation
is known for those yet.

Package        : libx11
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-31535
Debian Bug     : 988737

Roman Fiedler reported that missing length validation in various
functions provided by libx11, the X11 client-side library, allow
to inject X11 protocol commands on X clients, leading to
authentication bypass, denial of service or potentially the
execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.6.7-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libx11 packages.

For the detailed security status of libx11 please refer to its security
tracker page at:

# CVE-2021-31535 libX11 Insufficient Length Checks PoC and Archeology

---

Hello list,

A missing length check in libX11 causes data from LookupColor
requests mess up the client-server communication protocol and
inject malicious X server requests. The flaw is comparable to
SQLi injecting commands into database connections granting an
attacker access to all features of the connection protocol.

Even with the flaw being embedded in the C-API/library, it can
be easily demonstrated with a simple PoC run in xterm [1]. On
most terminals the PoC will only produce a nice, blue background
while with appropriate libX11 and xterm the same PoC disables
X server authorization, thus allowing any program to connect
to the X server and take over the screen session. For details
on exploitation see [2].

The flaw is also interesting in two more ways:

1) for xterm the flaw can be easily detected using fuzzing. So
I assume that a) nobody else fuzzed xterm yet, even being that
old (less likely) or b) that the flaw was deemed a mere DoS
(interruption of X communication) but as it did not involve a
buffer overflow, was not seen exploitable or otherwise worth
reporting. Even I myself stumbled over it it already years ago
but then again forgot about it until doing some testing around
other recent rxvt/xterm flaws (CVE-2021-27135).

2) from archeological perspective it would have been interesting
to prove and not only assume, since when the bug was really exploitable.
At least the code seems to date back quite some time to 1986.
But even not from distant past, finding sufficient online resources
from that era to revive an ancient system and run an X environment
was not yet possible. If it happens that someone still has access
to full system backups of an X server system of that time I would
be happy to try to turn this into an emulator image and test
the exploit.
