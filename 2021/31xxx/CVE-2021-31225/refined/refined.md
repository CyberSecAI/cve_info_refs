Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access checks in SES Evolution, specifically regarding the deletion of resources (scripts) that are not currently in use by any security policy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Access Control:** The system allows deletion of scripts without verifying if the user performing the action has the appropriate permissions to modify resources.
- **Unprotected Resource Deletion:**  Resources (scripts) can be deleted even if they're essential for the system, such as those used for detecting malicious actions or determining security policies, provided they are not actively being used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (Availability Impact):** An attacker can remove essential scripts, hindering the system's ability to respond to malicious activities or enforce the correct security policies.
- **Compromised Security Policy:** The removal of scripts can undermine the intended security posture of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Adjacent Network:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the target.
- **Social Engineering/User Interaction:** The attack requires tricking a user who has access to the SES Evolution console on their machine to execute a malicious program.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Adjacent Network Access:** The attacker needs to be present on the adjacent network.
- **User Compromise:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a user that has the SES Evolution console installed on their machine.
- **Malware Execution:** The attacker needs to make the user execute a malicious program on the user's machine.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Versions:** Stormshield Endpoint Security (SES) versions 2.0.0 to 2.0.2 are impacted.
- **Fix:**  The vulnerability is fixed in SES version 2.1.0.
- **CVSS Score:**
    - Base Score: 3.5 (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)
    - Temporal Score: 3.2 (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L/E:P/RL:O/RC:C)
    - Environmental Score: 3.2 (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L/E:P/RL:O/RC:C/CR:L/IR:L/AR:M/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X)
