Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-31486:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the improper parsing of DWF (Design Web Format) files by OpenText Brava! Desktop. Specifically, there's a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within these files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The insufficient validation of user-supplied data in DWF files leads to a write operation that goes past the boundaries of an allocated buffer. This out-of-bounds write can corrupt memory and potentially overwrite critical data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This means the attacker can potentially gain full control over the targeted machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious DWF File:** The primary attack vector involves a user opening a maliciously crafted DWF file.
*   **Malicious Web Page:** The advisory also indicates that the user might be lured to a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability when a DWF file is processed by the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation of this vulnerability requires user interaction. The targeted user must either open a malicious DWF file or visit a malicious web page that triggers the flaw. This implies the attacker must rely on social engineering tactics or other methods to persuade the user to perform these actions.
*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can be located remotely and does not need direct access to the victim's machine, as long as they can deliver the malicious DWF file or the link to the malicious web page.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Product:** OpenText Brava! Desktop
*   **Affected File Format:** DWF
*   **Vendor Fix:**  The vulnerability was fixed in version 6.6.4.114 of OpenText Brava! Desktop.
*   **ZDI Tracking Number:** ZDI-21-626 / ZDI-CAN-12712
