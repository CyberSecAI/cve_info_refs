  "source_content": "Addressed potential issues where remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the application. There is a potential problem with overwriting buffers in the parser of the PSP file. (CVE-2021-31438) ... This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit Studio Photo. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of PSP files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer when handling PSP files.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow"
  ],
  "impact": "Remote code execution in the context of the current process.",
  "attack_vector": "Exploitation requires user interaction, such as visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious PSP file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "A remote attacker needs the ability to make the user open a specially crafted PSP file. This could be accomplished by tricking a user into visiting a malicious webpage that downloads the PSP file or by tricking a user into opening the file."
