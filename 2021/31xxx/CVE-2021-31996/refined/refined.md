- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `merge_sort::merge()` function in the `algorithmica` crate duplicates and drops ownership of type `T` without preventing double frees.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Double-free vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Calling `merge_sort::merge()` on a `Vec<T: Drop>` can lead to a crash due to a double-free.
- **Attack vectors:** Invoking the vulnerable `merge_sort::merge()` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to call the `merge_sort::merge()` function with a vector containing elements that implement the `Drop` trait.
