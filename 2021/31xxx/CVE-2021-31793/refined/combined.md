|  | Description: |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | An issue exists in the NightOwl WDB-20-V2 Doorbell camera that allows an unauthenticated user to gain access to snapshots and video streams from the doorbell. The binary "app" running on firmware WDB-20-V2\_20190314 offers a web server on port 80 that allows an unauthenticate user to take a snapshot from the doorbell camera via "http://<IP>/snapshot". |
|  |  |
|  | Affected Components: |
|  |  |
|  | Firmware: WDB-20-V2\_20190314, binary:"app" |
|  |  |
|  | Futher Information: |
|  |  |
|  | The binary "app" provides undocumented functionality on a webserver, including a "snapshot" function that enables unauthenticated users to take a snapshot of the camera. |
