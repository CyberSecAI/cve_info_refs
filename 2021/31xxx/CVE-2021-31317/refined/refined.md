Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which corresponds to CVE-2021-31317:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a type confusion issue in the `VDasher` constructor of the rlottie library, specifically in the `VDasher::updateActiveSegment` function.
*   The code assumes that there will always be at least two dash properties (length and gap) in an animated sticker's dash array.
*   If only one dash property is present (length), the code attempts to read the second property (gap) from out-of-bounds memory.
*   This occurs because the `dashArray` (float array) is reinterpreted as a `VDasher::Dash*` structure which expects two float attributes (length, gap), even if it only contains one.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Type Confusion:** The code incorrectly casts a float array to a struct pointer, causing incorrect memory access.
*   **Out-of-bounds read:** Accessing `gap` attribute out-of-bounds when `dashArray` contains only the `length` attribute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Out-of-bounds heap memory access:** A remote attacker can read arbitrary heap memory on the victim's device.
*   Although the content states that an out-of-bounds write is also found, that vulnerability is related to a different function `VGradientCache::generateGradientColorTable`. This analysis refers to the type confusion.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote attack:** A specially crafted animated sticker is sent to a victim via Telegram.
*   **Triggering Condition:** The vulnerability is triggered when the victim opens the chat containing the malicious animated sticker causing the rlottie library to parse the malicious sticker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to send messages:** The attacker needs to be able to send messages containing the malicious animated sticker to a Telegram user.
*   **No user interaction (secret chats):** In the original exploitation scenario, the user needed to accept the secret chat for the exploit to trigger. However, this was changed when Telegram added the setting to filter chats.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Telegram clients on Android, iOS, and macOS.
*   The vulnerability was patched in Telegram version 7.1.0 (2090) and later.
*   The provided blogpost details the research process, including fuzzing techniques used to discover the vulnerability.
*   The blog also mentions other vulnerabilities found during the research, including heap out-of-bounds writes, stack out-of-bounds read/writes, integer overflows, and denial-of-service issues. However, those other vulnerabilities are not directly related to CVE-2021-31317.
*   Telegram implemented additional checks post-disclosure to verify that animated stickers received in secret chats belong to legitimate sticker sets, mitigating the attack vector.
