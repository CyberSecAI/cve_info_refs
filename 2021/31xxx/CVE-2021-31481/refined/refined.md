Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-31481

**Description:**

*   This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of OpenText Brava! Desktop.
*   User interaction is required for exploitation; the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
*   The vulnerability lies within the parsing of SLDPRT files.
*   The root cause is the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied value before it's dereferenced as a pointer.

**Root Cause:**

*   Improper validation of user-supplied data before dereferencing it as a pointer during the parsing of SLDPRT files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Untrusted Pointer Dereference:** The application uses a user-supplied value as a pointer without validating that the pointer is valid, leading to a potential crash or code execution.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate user-supplied data before using it to access memory, allowing for out-of-bounds reads/writes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user/process. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, and other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File:** An attacker can craft a malicious SLDPRT file that, when opened by a user, triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker can host a malicious web page that, when visited by a user, exploits the vulnerability (potentially using an iframe or other embedding techniques to load a malicious SLDPRT file).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote, as the vulnerability can be triggered by a file or webpage accessed by the user.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker relies on the user to open a malicious file or visit a malicious page.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 16.6.4.92.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2021-02-08.
