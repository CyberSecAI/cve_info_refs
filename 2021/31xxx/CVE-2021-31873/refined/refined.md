    {
      "type": "Root cause of vulnerability",
      "description": "The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow in the malloc() function within the klibc library. When allocating memory, the library adds overhead to the requested size. If the requested size is close to SIZE_MAX, this addition can lead to an integer overflow. This overflow results in a smaller allocation than intended and can lead to a subsequent heap buffer overflow when data is written into the undersized buffer."
