(non-US) DIR-816 :: Alll Revisions :: All Firmware :: End of Support / End of Life Product :: Multiple Security Vulnerabilities (inc. CVE-2021-31326)

**Overview**

The (non\_US) DIR-816, all hardware revisions, have reached their End of Life ("EOL") /End of Service Life ("EOS") Life-Cycle.  D-Link US recommends D-Link devices that have reached EOL/EOS, to be retired and replaced. Please contact your regional office for recommendations ([LINK](https://us.dlink.com/en/change-region)).

As a  general policy, when products reach EOS/EOL, they can no longer be supported, and all firmware development for these products cease.  **Please read information and recommendations****below**.

**3rd Party Report information**

    - **Reports provided:**

               - huanBIn Ruan :: doudoudedi233 \_at\_ gmail \_dot\_ com

- **Details :**

  The D-Link (non-US) DIR-816 Hardware Revisions A1 & A2:

 **- Exploit 1 ::** Firmware v1.01CNB04 :: [LINK](https://github.com/doudoudedi/main-DIR-816_A1_Command-injection) :: The HTTP request parameter is used in the handler function of /goform/form2userconfig.cgi

route, which can construct the user name string to delete the user function. This can lead to command injection through shell metacharacters.

 **- Exploit 2 ::** Firmware v1.10CNB05 :: [LINK](https://github.com/doudoudedi/main-DIR-816_A2_Command-injection) ::  **[CVE-2021-31326](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-31326)** :: The HTTP request parameter is used in the handler function of /goform/form2userconfig.cgi

route, which can construct the user name string to delete the user function. This can lead to command injection through shell metacharacters.

**Affected Models**

| **Model** | **Region** | **Hardware Revision** | **End of Support** | **Legacy Website** | **Last Updated** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DIR-816 | Worldwide | All Series H/W Revisions | 2019 | NO | 08/22/2021 |

Recommendation for End of Support /End of Life Products

From time to time, D-Link will decide that some of its products have reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life (“EOL”). D-Link may choose to EOS/EOL a product due to evolution of technology, market demands,  new innovations, product efficiencies based on new technologies, or the product matures over time and should be replaced by functionally superior technology.

**For US Consumer**

If a product has reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life ("EOL"), there is normally no further extended support or development for it.

Typically for these products, D-Link will be unable to resolve device or firmware issues since all development and customer support has ceased.

D-Link strongly recommends that this product be retired and cautions that any further use of this product may be a risk to devices connected to it. If US consumers continue to use these devices against D-Link's recommendation, please make sure the device has the most recent firmware, make sure you frequently update the device's unique password to access its web-configuration, and always have WIFI encryption enabled with a unique password.
