- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "Yoast SEO for TYPO3" extension does not properly validate URLs before making HTTP requests. Specifically, it fails to restrict analyzed URLs to domains managed by the current TYPO3 website.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A logged-in TYPO3 backend user can exploit this vulnerability to make HTTP requests to arbitrary domains, including the webserver itself or other internally managed resources. This could allow an attacker to potentially gain access to sensitive information or internal services.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the "Yoast SEO for TYPO3" extension. An attacker would need to be a logged-in TYPO3 backend user to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A logged-in TYPO3 backend user is required to exploit the vulnerability.
