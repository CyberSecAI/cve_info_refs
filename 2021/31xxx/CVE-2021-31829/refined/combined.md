Debian Bug     : 986949 988352 989451

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service, or information leaks.

CVE-2020-24586, CVE-2020-24587, CVE-2020-26147

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that many Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211, did not correctly implement reassembly
    of fragmented packets.  In some circumstances, an attacker within
    range of a network could exploit these flaws to forge arbitrary
    packets and/or to access sensitive data on that network.

CVE-2020-24588

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that most Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211, did not authenticate the "is
    aggregated" packet header flag.  An attacker within range of a
    network could exploit this to forge arbitrary packets on that
    network.

CVE-2020-25670, CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2021-23134

    kiyin (å°¹äº®) of TenCent discovered several reference counting bugs
    in the NFC LLCP implementation which could lead to use-after-free.
    A local user could exploit these for denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    Nadav Markus and Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered that
    the original fixes for these introduced a new bug that could
    result in use-after-free and double-free.  This has also been
    fixed.

CVE-2020-25672

    kiyin (å°¹äº®) of TenCent discovered a memory leak in the NFC LLCP
    implementation.  A local user could exploit this for denial of
    service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2020-26139

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that a bug in some Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211.  When operating in AP mode, they would
    forward EAPOL frames from one client to another while the sender
    was not yet authenticated.  An attacker within range of a network
    could use this for denial of service or as an aid to exploiting
    other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2020-26558, CVE-2021-0129

    Researchers at ANSSI discovered vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth
    Passkey authentication method, and in Linux's implementation of
    it.  An attacker within range of two Bluetooth devices while they
    pair using Passkey authentication could exploit this to obtain the
    shared secret (Passkey) and then impersonate either of the devices
    to each other.

CVE-2020-29374

    Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
    management.  A parent and child process initially share all their
    memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
    duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write).  However, in case an
    operation such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an
    additional reference to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs
    during this operation, the kernel might have accessed the wrong
    process's memory.  For some programs, this could lead to an
    information leak or data corruption.

CVE-2021-3483

    é©¬å“²å®‡ (Zheyu Ma) reported a bug in the "nosy" driver for TI
    PCILynx FireWire controllers, which could lead to list corruption
    and a use-after-free.  On a system that uses this driver, local
    users granted access to /dev/nosy could exploit this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3506

    The ADLab of venustech discovered a bug in the F2FS driver which
    could lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing a crafted
    filesystem.  A local user permitted to mount arbitrary filesystems
    could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash) or other
    security impact.

CVE-2021-3564, CVE-2021-3573, CVE-2021-32399

    The BlockSec team discovered several race conditions in the
    Bluetooth subsystem that could lead to a use-after-free or
    double-free.  A local user could exploit these to caue a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-3587

    Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a potential null
    pointer dereference in the NFC LLCP implementation.  A local user
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-23133

    Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered a race condition in the
    SCTP implementation, which can lead to list corruption.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28688 (XSA-371)

    It was discovered that the original fix for CVE-2021-26930
    (XSA-365) introduced a potential resource leak.  A malicious guest
    could presumably exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (resource exhaustion) within the host.

CVE-2021-28964

    Zygo Blaxell reported a race condition in the Btrfs driver which
    can lead to an assertion failure.  On systems using Btrfs, a local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-28971

    Vince Weaver reported a bug in the performance event handler for
    Intel PEBS.  A workaround for a hardware bug on Intel CPUs
    codenamed "Haswell" and earlier could lead to a null pointer
    dereference.  On systems with the affected CPUs, if users are
    permitted to access performance events, a local user may exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    By default, unprivileged users do not have access to performance
    events, which mitigates this issue.  This is controlled by the
    kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2021-29154

    It was discovered that the Extended BPF (eBPF) JIT compiler
    for x86_64 generated incorrect branch instructions in some
    cases.  On systems where eBPF JIT is enabled, users could
    exploit this to execute arbitrary code in the kernel.

    By default, eBPF JIT is disabled, mitigating this issue.  This is
    controlled by the net.core.bpf_jit_enable sysctl.

CVE-2021-29155, CVE-2021-31829

    Piotr Krysiuk and Benedict Schlueter discovered that the Extended
    BPF (eBPF) verifier did not completely protect against information
    leaks due to speculative execution.  A local user could exploit
    these to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

CVE-2021-29264

    It was discovered that the "gianfar" Ethernet driver used with
    some Freescale SoCs did not correctly handle a Rx queue overrun
    when jumbo packets were enabled.  On systems using this driver and
    jumbo packets, an attacker on the network could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (crash).

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-29647

    The syzbot tool found an information leak in the Qualcomm IPC
    Router (qrtr) implementation.

    This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-29650

    It was discovered that a data race in the netfilter subsystem
    could lead to a null pointer dereference during replacement of a
    table.  A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user
    namespace could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    By default, unprivileged users cannot create user namespaces,
    which mitigates this issue.  This is controlled by the
    kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl.

CVE-2021-31916

    Dan Carpenter reported incorrect parameter validation in the
    device-mapper (dm) subsystem, which could lead to a heap buffer
    overrun.  However, only users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability
    (i.e. root-equivalent) could trigger this bug, so it did not
    have any security impact in this kernel version.

CVE-2021-33034

    The syzbot tool found a bug in the Bluetooth subsystem that could
    lead to a use-after-free.  A local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.194-1~deb9u1.  This update additionally fixes Debian bug
#986949, #988352, and #989451; and includes many more bug fixes from
stable updates 4.19.182-4.19.194 inclusive.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1957788#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-05-06 13:37:11 UTC  ``` Programs inserted by privileged users can run Privileged BPF programs running on affected systems can bypass the protection and execute speculative loads from the kernel stack.

For the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8 kernel  to confirm the current state, inspect the sysctl with the command:  # cat /proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_bpf_disabled  The setting of 1 would mean that unprivileged users can not use eBPF, mitigating the flaw.

Subject: [CVE-2021-31829] Linux kernel protection of stack pointer against
 speculative pointer arithmetic can be bypassed to leak content of kernel memory

An issue has been discovered in the Linux kernel mechanism to mitigate
speculative loads (Spectre mitigation).

Unprivileged BPF programs running on affected systems can bypass
the protection and execute speculative loads from the kernel stack.
This can be abused to extract contents of the stack via side-channel.
The extracted contents may include addresses of kernel structures
that could be used to defeat Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization
(KASLR) to facilitate exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

The identified gap is that when protecting BPF stack pointer against
speculative pointer arithmetic, the BPF stack area itself is not
protected against speculative loads. This could be abused to perform
speculative loads from any location within the BPF stack. And so
any restricted data from the BPF stack could be disclosed, such as
addresses of data structures referred by the BPF program. Further,
the original content of kernel memory is not wiped when allocating
the BPF stack, and could be disclosed as well.

I developed a PoC that allows unprivileged local users to extract
contents of 511 bytes from the BPF stack.

The PoC has been shared privately with <security@...nel.org> to assist
with fix development.

The patches are available from the BPF subsystem public git repository.

The fix has dependency of another recent commit fixing a separate
issue. The full patch series is as follows:

Subject: bpf: Fix leakage of uninitialized bpf stack under speculation
The current implemented mechanisms to mitigate data disclosure under
speculation mainly address stack and map value oob access from the
speculative domain. However, Piotr discovered that uninitialized BPF
stack is not protected yet, and thus old data from the kernel stack,
potentially including addresses of kernel structures, could still be
extracted from that 512 bytes large window. The BPF stack is special
compared to map values since it's not zero initialized for every
program invocation, whereas map values /are/ zero initialized upon
their initial allocation and thus cannot leak any prior data in either
domain. In the non-speculative domain, the verifier ensures that every
stack slot read must have a prior stack slot write by the BPF program
to avoid such data leaking issue.
However, this is not enough: for example, when the pointer arithmetic
operation moves the stack pointer from the last valid stack offset to
the first valid offset, the sanitation logic allows for any intermediate
offsets during speculative execution, which could then be used to
extract any restricted stack content via side-channel.
Given for unprivileged stack pointer arithmetic the use of unknown
but bounded scalars is generally forbidden, we can simply turn the
register-based arithmetic operation into an immediate-based arithmetic
operation without the need for masking. This also gives the benefit
of reducing the needed instructions for the operation. Given after
the work in 7fedb63a8307 ("bpf: Tighten speculative pointer arithmetic
mask"), the aux->alu\_limit already holds the final immediate value for
the offset register with the known scalar. Thus, a simple mov of the
immediate to AX register with using AX as the source for the original
instruction is sufficient and possible now in this case.

bpf: Fix leakage of uninitialized bpf stack under speculation

```
The current implemented mechanisms to mitigate data disclosure under
speculation mainly address stack and map value oob access from the
speculative domain. However, Piotr discovered that uninitialized BPF
stack is not protected yet, and thus old data from the kernel stack,
potentially including addresses of kernel structures, could still be
extracted from that 512 bytes large window. The BPF stack is special
compared to map values since it's not zero initialized for every
program invocation, whereas map values /are/ zero initialized upon
their initial allocation and thus cannot leak any prior data in either
domain. In the non-speculative domain, the verifier ensures that every
stack slot read must have a prior stack slot write by the BPF program
to avoid such data leaking issue.

However, this is not enough: for example, when the pointer arithmetic
operation moves the stack pointer from the last valid stack offset to
the first valid offset, the sanitation logic allows for any intermediate
offsets during speculative execution, which could then be used to
extract any restricted stack content via side-channel.

Given for unprivileged stack pointer arithmetic the use of unknown
but bounded scalars is generally forbidden, we can simply turn the
register-based arithmetic operation into an immediate-based arithmetic
operation without the need for masking. This also gives the benefit
of reducing the needed instructions for the operation. Given after
the work in [7fedb63](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/7fedb63a8307dda0ec3b8969a3b233a1dd7ea8e0) ("bpf: Tighten speculative pointer arithmetic
mask"), the aux->alu_limit already holds the final immediate value for
the offset register with the known scalar. Thus, a simple mov of the
immediate to AX register with using AX as the source for the original
instruction is sufficient and possible now in this case.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
