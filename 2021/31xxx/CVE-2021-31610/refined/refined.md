  "CVE-2021-31610": {
    "description": "The Bluetooth Classic implementation on several chipsets does not properly handle the reception of continuous unsolicited LMP responses that trigger a heap overflow within the BT firmware. This allows attackers in radio range to trigger a denial of service (either restart or deadlock the device) by flooding a device with LMP_AU_rand packet.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Improper handling of continuous unsolicited LMP responses leading to a heap overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap overflow vulnerability due to lack of proper input validation/handling of LMP_AU_rand packets.",
        "Lack of proper rate limiting for LMP responses."
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service (DoS), either device restart or deadlock.",
      "attack_vectors": "Over-the-air (OTA) Bluetooth communication using a crafted LMP_AU_rand packet flooding attack.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be in radio range of the target device and be able to send Bluetooth packets. No prior pairing or authentication is needed."
