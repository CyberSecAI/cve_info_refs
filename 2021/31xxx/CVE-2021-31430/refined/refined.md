Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the IDE virtual device of Parallels Desktop. This insufficient validation allows for a read past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the software attempts to access memory outside of the allocated buffer.
*   **Improper input validation:** The root cause of the out-of-bounds read is the absence of proper input validation of user-supplied data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information from the affected Parallels Desktop installation.
*  **Privilege Escalation (Potential):** The advisory notes that an attacker can potentially leverage this vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code within the context of the hypervisor.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack is local, requiring the attacker to have access to the guest system where Parallels Desktop is running.
*   **Guest system:** The attack is targeting the guest system.
*   **IDE virtual device:** The vulnerability is specifically located in the IDE virtual device component of Parallels Desktop.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **High-Privileged Code Execution:** The attacker must first be able to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system before they can exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-21-438 and ZDI-CAN-13188.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Parallels on 2021-02-26, and a coordinated public release occurred on 2021-04-21.
*   Parallels has released an update to address this vulnerability.
*   The CVSS score is 6.0 with a vector of AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N which indicates that it is a local attack with high privileges required, no user interaction needed and the scope is changed with high confidentiality impact.
