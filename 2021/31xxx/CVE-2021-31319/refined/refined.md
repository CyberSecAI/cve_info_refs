Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31319:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a signed integer overflow in the `LOTGradient::populate` function within the rlottie library, which is used by Telegram for rendering animated stickers. Specifically, the `colorPoints * 4` calculation can overflow, leading to an out-of-bounds read when accessing `colorPoints` in memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Integer overflow:** The multiplication `colorPoints * 4` can overflow to a negative value due to the signed integer nature of `colorPoints`.
- **Out-of-bounds read:**  The overflowed value is then used in pointer arithmetic, causing an out-of-bounds memory access when reading color data from the `ptr`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker could gain the ability to access heap memory out-of-bounds on a victim's device running a vulnerable version of Telegram. This could potentially lead to information disclosure or other undefined behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malicious animated sticker, specifically crafted to trigger the integer overflow in `LOTGradient::populate`. This sticker can be sent to a victim over Telegram and triggers when the victim opens the chat containing the malicious animated sticker.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and send a malicious animated sticker to a Telegram user. This is most easily done in secret chats due to Telegram server-side filtering of stickers in normal chats at the time of the report.
- The attacker needs to have some knowledge of the Lottie animation format and the specific vulnerability in `LOTGradient::populate` to craft the malicious sticker.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in Telegram's fork of the rlottie library.
- The vulnerability is located in `lottiemodel.cpp` file, function `LOTGradient::populate`, specifically at the following lines in release-7.0.1_2065 branch: [https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram/blob/release-7.0.1_2065/TMessagesProj/jni/rlottie/src/lottie/lottiemodel.cpp#L198](https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram/blob/release-7.0.1_2065/TMessagesProj/jni/rlottie/src/lottie/lottiemodel.cpp#L198), [https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram/blob/release-7.0.1_2065/TMessagesProj/jni/rlottie/src/lottie/lottiemodel.cpp#L204](https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram/blob/release-7.0.1_2065/TMessagesProj/jni/rlottie/src/lottie/lottiemodel.cpp#L204), and [https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram/blob/release-7.0.1_2065/TMessagesProj/jni/rlottie/src/lottie/lottiemodel.cpp#L211](https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram/blob/release-7.0.1_2065/TMessagesProj/jni/rlottie/src/lottie/lottiemodel.cpp#L211).
- The vulnerability was fixed in Telegram version 7.1.0 (2090) and later.
- Telegram implemented a server-side check to verify that stickers in secret chats are part of a valid sticker set, mitigating the vulnerability.
- The report of this vulnerability is linked to several other vulnerabilities discovered in the rlottie library by the same researcher.
