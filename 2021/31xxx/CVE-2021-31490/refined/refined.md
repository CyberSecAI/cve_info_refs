Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-31490

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the improper parsing of DWF files within OpenText Brava! Desktop. Specifically, there is a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when processing these files. This can lead to a write operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.
    *   Lack of proper bounds checking on user-supplied data during DWF file parsing.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running the application.
    *   Potential for full system compromise depending on the privileges of the user running the application.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector involves a malicious DWF file.
    *   User interaction is required. The target must either open a malicious DWF file or visit a web page that triggers the vulnerability.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious DWF file that exploits the parsing vulnerability.
    *   The attacker also needs a method to deliver the file to the target (e.g., through a website or email attachment).

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in OpenText Brava! Desktop version 6.6.4.114.
*   This vulnerability is identified as ZDI-21-630 and ZDI-CAN-12718 by the Zero Day Initiative.
*   The CVSS score is 7.8, with a vector of AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. This indicates a high severity vulnerability that can lead to complete system compromise.

In summary, this vulnerability is a critical flaw in OpenText Brava! Desktop that allows for remote code execution via a specially crafted DWF file. The lack of proper input validation during the parsing process is the root cause of the vulnerability.
