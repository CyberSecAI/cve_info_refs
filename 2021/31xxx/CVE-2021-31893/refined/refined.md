- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the affected software while handling certain files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow (CWE-120) where the software copies data into a buffer without proper size checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition or potentially remote code execution (RCE).
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a local attacker by manipulating project files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to manipulate project files.
