SUMMARY

Multiple SIMATIC Software products are affected by a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to
manipulate project ﬁles and remotely execute code.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet
available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to project ﬁles on the engineering station to trusted users

• Only use project ﬁles from trusted sources

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC PCS 7 is a distributed control system (DCS) integrating SIMATIC WinCC, SIMATIC Batch,
SIMATIC Route Control, OpenPCS7 and other components.

SIMATIC PDM (Process Device Manager) is an universal, manufacturer-independent tool for conﬁguration,
parameter assignment, commissioning, diagnostics and maintenance of intelligent process devices
(actors, sensors) and automation components (remote I/Os, multiplexer, process control units, compact
controller).

SIMATIC STEP 7 V5.X is the classic engineering software to conﬁgure and program SIMATIC S7-300/S7-
400/C7/WinAC controllers.

STARTER is the drive engineering tool for parameterizing and commissioning.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-31893

The affected software contains a buffer overﬂow vulnerability while handling certain ﬁles that could allow
a local attacker to trigger a denial-of-service condition or potentially lead to remote code execution.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS Vector
CWE

7.8
CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input (‘Classic
Buffer Overﬂow’)
