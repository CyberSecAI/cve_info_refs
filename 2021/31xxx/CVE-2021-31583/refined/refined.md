Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31583:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before it is displayed back to the user in the web interface. Specifically, multiple parameters in several scripts within the Sipwise software platform fail to sanitize input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected and stored XSS. Input provided through various parameters are not properly sanitized before being rendered in the user's browser, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML and script code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML and script code within a user's browser session in the context of the affected Sipwise site. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, including:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Phishing attacks
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Data theft
    *   Defacement of the web page

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload. When a user clicks this link, the injected script is executed in their browser.
*   **Stored XSS:** An attacker could insert malicious code into a field, such as a user profile, which is then stored on the server and executed in the browser of other users who access it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The vulnerability requires the attacker to be an authenticated user of the Sipwise platform. The vulnerability is present within the administrative panel, which implies an attacker with administrative privileges could exploit it
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** An attacker must identify the specific parameters within the vulnerable scripts that do not sanitize user inputs.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to craft HTML/JavaScript payloads for the XSS attacks

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Sipwise C5, also known as NGCP (Next Generation Communication Platform).
*   The specific vulnerable component is the "NGCP www\_admin".
*   The affected versions are NGCP www\_admin version 3.6.7 and <= NGCP CE 3.0 (up to and including).
*   The vendor has stated that NGCP www\_admin version 3.6.7 has not been in use since mr3.0 (7+ years ago), and that component was completely abandoned around 4 years ago.
*   The 'addressbook' component is also distinct and was available only on www_csc, which has not been used for 7 years.
