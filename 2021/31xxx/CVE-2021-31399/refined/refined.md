Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-31399:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authentication or validation in the communication between the 2N Access Unit 2.0 and a web relay. Specifically, the access unit does not verify the IP address of the web relay it communicates with.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Vulnerability:** The core issue is that an attacker can intercept and manipulate the communication between the access unit and the web relay by impersonating the IP address of the legitimate web relay.
- **Lack of IP Address Verification:** The access unit does not authenticate the web relay, making it susceptible to IP spoofing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Compromised Access Control:**  A successful MitM attack could allow an attacker to manipulate the access control system. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to the secured area.
- **Loss of Confidentiality and Integrity:** Attackers could potentially intercept or modify communication between the access unit and the web relay, leading to a loss of confidentiality and/or integrity. This includes potentially interfering with the device's intended function or logging.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-Based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploited over the network by positioning an attacker between the access unit and the web relay.
- **IP Address Spoofing:** The attacker spoofs the IP address of the legitimate web relay.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Proximity:**  The attacker needs to be on the same network segment or be able to intercept network traffic between the access unit and the web relay.
- **IP Spoofing Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to spoof the IP address of the web relay to establish a malicious connection.
- **No Prior Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or privileges to carry out the attack.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Product:** 2N Access Unit 2.0 with firmware version 2.31.0.40.5.
- **CVSS Score:** 4.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L). This indicates an attack that can be carried out on an adjacent network, has low complexity, requires no privileges, needs user interaction and has limited impact.
- The advisory was created by RÃ©my Grandin.
- 2N was notified of this vulnerability on April 7, 2021 and will fix it in the future.
