  "CVE-2021-31434": {
    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit Studio Photo. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JPM files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
    "root_cause": "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data in the parsing of JPM files, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated structure.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds write"
