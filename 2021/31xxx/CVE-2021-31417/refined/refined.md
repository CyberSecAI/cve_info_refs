Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-31417

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper memory initialization in the Toolgate component of Parallels Desktop. The Toolgate component fails to initialize memory before accessing it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uninitialized Memory: The core weakness is that the Toolgate component accesses memory without properly initializing it first, leading to information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to sensitive information from the uninitialized memory.
- Potential Privilege Escalation: The advisory mentions this flaw can be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges, allowing the execution of arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor, indicating further potential for system compromise beyond just information disclosure

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker needs to be able to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system. This means the vulnerability is not directly exploitable by remote attackers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Low-Privileged Code Execution: The attacker must have the capability to execute low-privileged code within the guest operating system running under Parallels Desktop.

**Additional Information**
- The vulnerability was reported to Parallels on 2020-12-09 and a coordinated public release of the advisory was done on 2021-04-21.
- Parallels released a fix for this vulnerability.
- The affected product is Parallels Desktop.
- CVSS Score is 6.5 with vector string AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N
