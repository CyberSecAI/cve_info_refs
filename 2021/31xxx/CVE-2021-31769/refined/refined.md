Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

- The MyQ print server software, running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, allows unauthenticated users to list system files and directories through the "task scheduler" functionality.
- Insufficient access control on the file listing functionality allows non-privileged users to access the same directories as the administrator.
- The application saves session data in a publicly accessible directory allowing for the potential of session hijacking and privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):**  The application fails to properly check user privileges when accessing the file listing functionality. This allows unprivileged users to list files they shouldn't have access to.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By obtaining the administrator's session ID, an attacker can gain administrator privileges within the application.
- **Lack of access control:** The application stores session data in a publicly accessible directory, `C:\Program Files\MyQ\PHP\Sessions`, which can be read by non-privileged users.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By combining the access control vulnerability with task scheduler functionality, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Unprivileged users can list sensitive system files and directories.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain administrative access to the MyQ application by hijacking an administrator session.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server by abusing the task scheduler. This leads to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** An attacker needs network access to the MyQ server to send HTTP requests and exploit the vulnerability.
- **Web Interface:** The attack exploits the MyQ web interface through HTTP requests, by manipulating the session cookies and using the "task scheduler" functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the MyQ print server.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to manipulate HTTP requests and cookies.
- **User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the MyQ system (even an unprivileged one is sufficient) to obtain session information.

**Additional details**

- The attacker can identify administrator sessions by accessing the publicly available session files.
- The vulnerability is exploitable even if the attacker has only a regular user account.
- The attacker can gain RCE by creating a scheduled task with an external command to execute PHP code.

**Fix:**
The vulnerability was fixed in `MyQ Print Server 8.2 patch 3` by removing external commands from the task scheduler and restricting file listing functionality. The MyQ Central Server also received a fix in version 8.2.
