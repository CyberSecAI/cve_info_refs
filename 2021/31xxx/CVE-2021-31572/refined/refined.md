The provided content is a commit diff from the FreeRTOS-Kernel repository on GitHub. It shows a change in the `stream_buffer.c` file, specifically related to adding an overflow check for stream buffer allocation.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The original code lacked a proper check for integer overflow when calculating the size of the buffer to allocate, potentially leading to a smaller than expected buffer being allocated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer overflow vulnerability: If `xBufferSizeBytes` is close to the maximum value that can be stored in its data type, incrementing it by one or more could cause it to wrap around to a small number, leading to the allocation of an undersized memory buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Heap overflow: Because an undersized buffer is allocated, writing data beyond the allocated buffer boundaries would result in a heap overflow. This could cause unpredictable program behavior, corruption of other data on the heap, or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability would be triggered when a user creates a stream buffer with a size close to the maximum value, which would trigger the integer overflow and subsequently the allocation of a smaller buffer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need control over the size of a stream buffer being created to exploit the vulnerability by causing the size to be close to the maximum allowed, leading to the integer overflow.

**Additional Details:**

The commit message indicates that this change adds an "addition overflow check". The code diff shows that the check added specifically validates that an integer overflow has not occurred during the size calculation of `xBufferSizeBytes`, using this condition: `if( xBufferSizeBytes < ( xBufferSizeBytes + 1 + sizeof( StreamBuffer_t ) ) )`. If this check fails (i.e., an integer overflow occurred), the code allocates memory using the correct (non-overflowed) size after the correction `xBufferSizeBytes++`  is made.
