Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31421:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path within the Toolgate component of Parallels Desktop. Specifically, the application does not sufficiently validate the path before using it in file operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The core weakness is directory traversal, which allows an attacker to manipulate file paths to access or manipulate files outside of the intended directory.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate user-supplied paths, leading to the directory traversal vulnerability.
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Due to the directory traversal vulnerability, an attacker can delete arbitrary files by providing malicious paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to delete arbitrary files on the affected system, in the context of the hypervisor. This could lead to data loss, system instability, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local access to the guest system. An attacker needs the ability to execute code on the guest system.
- **Malicious Path:** The attacker provides a maliciously crafted file path to the Toolgate component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High-Privilege Code Execution:** The attacker must first gain the ability to execute code with high privileges on the target guest system.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerability and be able to craft a malicious file path that triggers the arbitrary file deletion.
