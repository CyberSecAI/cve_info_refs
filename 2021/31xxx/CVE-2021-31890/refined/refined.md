Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2021-31890:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the total length of a TCP payload, as set in the IP header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The system fails to check if the TCP payload length specified in the IP header is valid, allowing for the possibility of crafted packets with inconsistent length values.
*   **CWE-240: Improper Handling of Inconsistent Structural Elements:** This CWE is assigned to the vulnerability, highlighting the failure to manage structural inconsistencies in the received data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leak:** Depending on how the network buffer is organized in memory, an attacker could potentially leak sensitive information.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to DoS conditions by causing the system to behave unexpectedly when processing packets with invalid TCP payload lengths.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted TCP packets over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device to send malicious TCP packets.
*   **No Special Privileges Required**: No special privileges or user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities collectively known as "NUCLEUS:13" found in the Nucleus RTOS TCP/IP stack.
*   Multiple Siemens products are affected including: SIMOTICS CONNECT 400, Capital Embedded AR Classic, PLUSCONTROL 1st Gen devices, APOGEE, TALON and Desigo PXC/PXM Products and Nucleus ReadyStart V4.
*   The vulnerability is described using the identifier FSMD-2021-0017 within the Siemens advisories.
*   The CVSS v3.1 base score is 7.5, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C.
