Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-31233

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `edit_breed.php` file of the Fighting Cock Information System v1.0. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`id` parameter) into a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly uses the `$_GET['id']` parameter in the SQL query without any input validation or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A successful SQL injection attack can allow an attacker to bypass authentication and retrieve sensitive information from the database, which may include user credentials, personal details, or other confidential data stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker.
*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter in the HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `edit_breed.php` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the vulnerable web application.

**Vulnerable Code Block:**

```php
<?php

error_reporting(1);
$id = $_GET['id'];
include '../../../config/db_config.php';

$sql = "SELECT * FROM breeders where breeder_id = '$id' ";
$result = $conn->query($sql);
```
