Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a combination of two vulnerabilities:

1.  **Arbitrary File Upload:** The `/inter/uploadFile.php` endpoint allows unauthenticated users to upload files to the server without proper validation or authorization.
2.  **File Inclusion:** The `/inter/ajax.php` endpoint is vulnerable to file inclusion, allowing an attacker to include and execute arbitrary files from the server's file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The `/inter/uploadFile.php` endpoint does not implement proper access controls, allowing unauthenticated users to upload files.
*   **Lack of File Extension Validation:** The upload mechanism does not properly validate the file extension, allowing the upload of potentially dangerous files like PHP scripts.
*   **File Inclusion Vulnerability:** The `/inter/ajax.php` endpoint allows arbitrary file inclusion, which, when combined with the arbitrary file upload vulnerability, leads to remote code execution.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `/inter/ajax.php` endpoint does not properly sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to specify the path of an uploaded file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can upload a malicious PHP script and then include it via the file inclusion vulnerability, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to full system compromise by allowing the attacker to execute commands and potentially gain control over the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request to `/inter/uploadFile.php`:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request with a malicious PHP file. The `savepath` parameter can control the subdirectory where the file will be saved.
*   **HTTP POST Request to `/inter/ajax.php`:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request that contains the path to the previously uploaded file. This path is then used in an include operation, executing the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to craft HTTP POST requests to send malicious data to the vulnerable endpoints.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The vulnerabilities do not require authentication, meaning an attacker can exploit them without valid credentials.

**Additional Details:**

*   The attacker uses the `savepath` parameter in the first request to specify the directory where the file is uploaded, and then uses the generated filename to include the uploaded file in a subsequent request.
*   The attacker uses the `file_put_contents` function within the uploaded PHP file to create a `Trojan.php` file, allowing easier access to the malicious payload.
*   The provided request headers such as `Content-Type`, `User-Agent` and the use of `multipart/form-data` are typical of a standard HTTP request.
*   The use of `XMLHttpRequest` in the second request points to the use of an AJAX request, often used in web application environments.
*   The content implies that once the malicious file is uploaded, it is not directly accessible through the web server, but can be accessed through the file inclusion vulnerability.
