{
  "CVE-2021-31810": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from how the Net::FTP module handles PASV command responses. A malicious FTP server can insert an arbitrary IP address and port into the PASV response, causing the client to connect to this malicious address instead of the server.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Improper input validation/handling",
      "Uncontrolled connection to arbitrary host"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to initiate connections to arbitrary hosts and ports. This allows them to probe internal services, conduct port scans, and extract service banners from systems that should not be publicly accessible. This could result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a malicious FTP server providing a crafted PASV command response.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control an FTP server that a vulnerable client connects to."
