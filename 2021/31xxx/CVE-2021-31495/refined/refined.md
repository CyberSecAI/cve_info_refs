Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-31495

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the parsing of DXF files. This missing validation leads to a memory corruption condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is memory corruption due to the lack of input sanitization. This could include out-of-bounds writes, reads, or other memory related errors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This means the attacker can gain control of the application and potentially the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious File:**  An attacker can craft a malicious DXF file containing specially crafted data that triggers the memory corruption vulnerability when processed by the vulnerable software.
*   **Malicious Page:** An attacker can host a malicious page that would entice a user to open a DXF file or trigger the vulnerable parsing functionality of OpenText Brava!.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to induce a user to interact with the malicious content, i.e., open a malicious DXF file or visit a malicious page.

**Additional Information:**
*   **Affected Product:** OpenText Brava! Desktop version 16.6.3.84 is specifically mentioned as vulnerable.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 6.6.4.114.
*   **ZDI ID:** ZDI-CAN-13307
*   **CVSS Score:** 7.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
