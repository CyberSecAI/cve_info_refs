Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31783:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `show_default.php` file in the Piwigo LocalFilesEditor plugin was vulnerable to arbitrary file disclosure due to insufficient input validation of the `file` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** The `show_default.php` script used `file_get_contents()` to read the contents of the file specified in the `$_GET['file']` parameter without proper sanitization.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The initial check `check_input_parameter('file', $_GET, false, '/^(include\/config_default\.inc\.php|language\/[a-z]+\_[A-Z]+\/(common|admin)\.lang\.php)$/')` only validated the allowed file paths but did not prevent access to any readable file on the server if an attacker could bypass the is_admin() check. The check using `substr_count()` was insufficient and bypassed if the path did not include the strings 'config_default.inc.php' or '.lang.php'.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially read the content of any readable files on the server, which might include sensitive data, configuration files, or source code.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious URL with the `file` parameter pointing to the desired file to disclose, an attacker could bypass the intended file validation using `substr_count` and force the script to read arbitrary files via `file_get_contents`.
- The attacker needs to bypass `is_admin()` check, which the patch addresses by adding a check to `is_admin()` directly in the condition.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `show_default.php` script.
- The attacker needs to bypass the is_admin() check.
