Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31198:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the Microsoft Exchange Server OAB (Offline Address Book) service. This improper validation allows for arbitrary file writes to OAB folders.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Write:** The core weakness is the ability to write arbitrary files to OAB folders due to insufficient validation of user-provided data.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** While authentication is required, the advisory states the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can leverage the arbitrary file write vulnerability to achieve remote code execution in the context of the SYSTEM user, leading to complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** This is a network-based attack, as the advisory states that the vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers.
*   **OAB Service:** The specific vulnerability lies within the OAB service of Microsoft Exchange Server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** Although authentication is required, the advisory mentions that the authentication mechanism can be bypassed.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Microsoft Exchange server.
