### @ex0dus-0x **[ex0dus-0x](/ex0dus-0x)** commented [Apr 7, 2021](#issue-851897855)

### Bounty URL: <https://huntr.dev/bounties/1-other-mjs/>

### Description

Fixes how a heap buffer is allocates and properly copies over parsed JSON string to prevent any out-of-bounds read/writes.

It turns out that the culprit for this didn't exist in `json_get_escape_len`, but rather the very first allocation that gets made before copying over the parsed JSON string to begin parsing:

<https://github.com/cesanta/mjs/blob/4c870e584d2b2a538abcee5307c498cc37e7ef9d/mjs/src/mjs_json.c#L448=L449>

Since a string is being copied over, the buffer allocation is made with size `len + 1`, and after `memcpy`, a null byte is written to the end.

### Proof of Fix

Without the fix, mjs copies over garbage to the buffer for the previously mentioned test case:

```
$ ./mjs ../out/crash_offbyone
String: {"e":"1\`��;�
Length: 14
  at ../out/crash_offbyone:2
MJS error: invalid JSON string

```

With the fix and the insertion of the null-byte, the buffer points to the correct string being parsed:

```
String: {"e":"1\
Length: 8
  at ../out/crash_offbyone:2
MJS error: invalid JSON string

```

Sorry, something went wrong.
