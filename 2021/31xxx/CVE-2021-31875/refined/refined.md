Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect buffer allocation size when parsing JSON strings in `mjs_json.c`. Specifically, the buffer was allocated with a size of `len + 1`, where `len` is the length of the string being copied over. While the `+ 1` was intended for null termination, the null byte was not being written *after* the `memcpy`, causing a potential for out-of-bounds write when the memcpy wrote up to `len` bytes without null terminating, causing a read/write out of bounds

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** Due to the incorrect allocation and missing null byte, a heap buffer overflow can occur when parsing crafted JSON strings which may write out of allocated bounds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The heap buffer overflow could lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite heap metadata or other data structures, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution.
- The specific "Proof of Fix" section shows how the corrupted memory was being printed in the original case.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to supply a malicious JSON string to the vulnerable `mjs_json.c` parser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide input that will be processed by the vulnerable JSON parser. This suggests that a remote code execution could be achieved by crafting a malicious JSON and passing it through an application using this parser.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involved ensuring that a null byte was written *after* the `memcpy` to prevent the buffer overflow.
- The pull request (#2) in the 418sec/mjs repository addresses this vulnerability by correctly allocating the buffer size and ensures that the null byte is written.
- The linked huntr.dev bounty also refers to this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that there is a null terminator after the memcpy
- The vulnerability is located in the function `mjs_json.c#L448=L449` in the cesanta/mjs repository.
