Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-31828:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input validation in the Open Distro for Elasticsearch (ODFE) alerting module. Specifically, the `DestinationHttpClient.java` class constructs HTTP requests based on user-supplied data (URL, scheme, host, port, path, query parameters) without validating or sanitizing these inputs, which allows for the possibility of SSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary vulnerability is SSRF. An attacker, with access to the alerting module, can manipulate the destination URL to make HTTP requests to arbitrary internal or external resources.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The alerting module fails to validate or sanitize user-provided URLs and related parameters before sending HTTP requests. This allows attackers to specify arbitrary hosts and paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Internal Network Scanning:** Attackers can use the vulnerable service to probe internal services, potentially revealing sensitive information about the network topology and available services.
*   **Access to Internal Resources:** Attackers can access internal resources, including metadata APIs, Kubernetes APIs, and other local services that are not intended to be exposed.
*   **Exploitation of Other Vulnerabilities:** Attackers can leverage the SSRF vulnerability to request resources from other servers and exploit vulnerabilities in those systems.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By combining the SSRF with a vulnerability in another service, an attacker could achieve RCE on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Alerting Module:** The primary attack vector is the alerting module of Open Distro for Elasticsearch.
*   **Webhook Triggers:** Attackers create or modify "open distro monitor" with a malicious webhook destination configured to target internal resources.
*   **HTTP Methods:** The alerting module supports POST, PUT, and PATCH methods, which allows an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in other servers by sending specific requests and parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged User Access:** The attacker needs to be a privileged user in ODFE with access to the alerting module to create, modify, and trigger monitors.
*   **Network Access:** The ODFE instance needs to have network access to the internal resources the attacker wants to reach.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Open Distro for Elasticsearch versions up to 1.12.0.2.
*   The fix for this vulnerability involves adding a host deny list configuration.
*   The `destination.host.deny_list` setting allows administrators to configure which IP addresses the alerting module is denied access to.
*   The `destination.allow_list` enables an admin to configure the permitted alerting destinations.
*   The vulnerability was reported to AWS, who maintain the Open Distro plugin.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.13.1.0 of ODFE.
*   The CVE was created on April 26th and released May 6th of 2021.
