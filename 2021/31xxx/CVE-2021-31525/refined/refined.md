  "CVE-2021-31525": {
    "description": "The vulnerability is present in the net/http package of the Go programming language. The `ReadRequest` and `ReadResponse` functions can lead to a stack overflow due to uncontrolled recursion when processing very large HTTP headers. This can cause a denial-of-service (panic) in the affected applications.",
    "affected_components": [
      "net/http: ReadRequest",
      "net/http: ReadResponse",
      "golang.org/x/net/http2/h2c",
      "golang.org/x/net/http/httpguts:HeaderValuesContainsToken"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Uncontrolled recursion during the processing of large HTTP headers.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack overflow",
      "Denial of Service (DoS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (panic) in vulnerable Go applications by sending a crafted HTTP request or response with a very large header. This can lead to application crashes and unavailability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending crafted HTTP requests with excessively large headers to a Go server or client application.",
         "Malicious server sending crafted HTTP responses with large headers."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can be remote, sending malicious requests over the network. No user interaction or specific privileges are required.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability affects both `Transport` and `Client` in the `net/http` package. While `Server` is not vulnerable by default, it becomes vulnerable if the default maximum header size of 1MB is overridden using `Server.MaxHeaderBytes`. The vulnerability also extends to `golang.org/x/net/http2/h2c` and `HeaderValuesContainsToken` in `golang.org/x/net/http/httpguts`. The issue is triggered when the header size exceeds 7MB on 64-bit architectures or 4MB on 32-bit architectures."
