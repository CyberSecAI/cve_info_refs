{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when importing user details from Active Directory, leading to the injection of malicious scripts.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is executed when a user views the imported Active Directory user details. This could lead to various malicious activities, including:\n\t- Session hijacking (cookie theft)\n\t- Phishing attacks\n\t- Defacement of the web page\n\t- Redirecting users to malicious websites\n\t- Other client-side attacks",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the Active Directory user's name fields. The vulnerable application imports these users, and the malicious script is executed when a user views the details of the imported user within the application's user management interface.Specifically, the vulnerability occurs on the page `/admin/userconfiguration.do` after fetching users from the domain, and when a user is selected for import, the unsanitized name is loaded.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to:\n    1. Have an Active Directory account where they can modify user details.\n    2. Inject the malicious JavaScript code into the Active Directory user's name fields (first name, last name, etc.).\n    3. Have access to the ManageEngine Applications Manager web interface to trigger the execution of injected JavaScript during user import from AD.",
       "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was discovered by Raxis' lead penetration tester, Matt Dunn. The vulnerability was found in ManageEngine Applications Manager 15, Build 15080. The issue is fixed in version 15.1 Build 15130 and above. The provided content has a full proof of concept with screenshots showing the injection of the XSS payload, the unescaped HTML, and the execution of the javascript within a browser."
