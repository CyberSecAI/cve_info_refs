- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not verify the content or extension of uploaded files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted file upload vulnerability, lack of file content and extension validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious executable file can be uploaded and later downloaded and run by a client user, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Uploading a malicious file through the application's file upload functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to upload files to the affected application.
