{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists within the parsing of CAB files. When handling filenames specified within a CAB file, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Directory Traversal",
    "Improper path validation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-adjacent",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious CAB file that has crafted file paths within the CAB archive."
