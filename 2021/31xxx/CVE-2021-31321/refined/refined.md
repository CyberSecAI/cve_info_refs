Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31321:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `gray_split_cubic` function within the `rlottie` library.
- The `bez_stack` array has a fixed size of 49 elements (16 * 3 + 1). However, the index used to access this array is not properly validated within the loop, leading to out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow:  The `arc` pointer is manipulated within a loop. The code doesn't check if `arc` goes out-of-bounds for the stack allocated `bez_stack` array, leading to memory corruption. Specifically, writing outside the `bez_stack` array using `base[6].x = base[3].x` where `base` is `arc` causes memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can overwrite adjacent stack memory. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker could control the overwritten data.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when rendering animated stickers in Telegram.
- The `Transform` property of an animated sticker, which is controlled by the attacker, can be crafted to cause the overflow.
- This attack is triggered when a user opens a chat containing the malicious sticker.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted animated sticker to the victim.
- The victim needs to open the chat containing the malicious sticker to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The `rlottie` library is a custom fork used by Telegram for rendering animated stickers.
- The issue affects Telegram clients on Android, iOS, and macOS.
- The vulnerability was patched in Telegram version 7.1.0 (2090) and later.
- Telegram implemented a fix which verifies that stickers used are part of valid sticker sets to mitigate this vector, as a result of this research.
