About World Laboratory of Bugtraq 2** **([WLB2](http://cxsecurity.org/ "World Laboratory of Bugtraq 2"))** *World Laboratory of Bugtraq* is a huge collection of information on data communications safety. Its main objective is to inform about errors in various applications. The **WLB** tolerance does not exclude information on errors in a configuration or other entries of this kind of dangerous operations character. One of the basic foundations of "World Laboratory of Bugtraq" is interaction with users. Each safety note, can be reported, and then verified by the **CXSecurity**. The second version of the database **WLB2**, introduces many changes from the previous version **WLB1**, acting on pages *securityreason.com*. Adding value for CVE CWE CVSS-defined entries in the database or add a new status of 'exploit' is not the only innovations in the next version of *World Laboratory of Bugtraq* **(WLB2)**. We wish you a good time. I do not believe in democracy ...CXSECURITY Team == **One** person!Support an independent blog.Let our enemy will be your enemy.Peace and respect for all.  ---   **1. Identification of safety notes** Determining the entry number in the WLB base is performed on the basis of assigning an individual number to every entry, according to the following pattern | **WLB-YYYYMMNNNN** | *where:*:  | *YYYY* | - the year in which the given data were entered into the base | | --- | --- | | *MM* | - analogically, the month | | *NNNN* | - the number which identifies a given entry in the base | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |   An example number **WLB** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |   **WLB-2000111234** which proves that a given entry was added to the base in November, 2000. The last numbers denote the ID number the given vulnerability in the given year and month. In order to refer to a WLB number, one is allowed to use the following syntax: *https://cxsecurity.com/issue/[the number WLB]* or use a search engine [*https://cxsecurity.com/search/*](/search/)  ---   **2. Adding entries** A WLB list has no limitations concerning information on data communications safety. Everyone is allowed to send a proposal of a note to the list. Just use this form or email *submit@cxsecurity.com* Safety notes can be added automatically by moderators. ---   **3. Description specification of the note details**  | ***Topic*** | defines the topic of an vulnerability, containing general information about the software and the kind of an error. | | --- | --- | | ***Date*** | defines the year, the month, the day. The aim of this value is to inform the user when a given entry was officially made accessible. It is analogical with the Updated field, with a small difference referring to the last accepted change in a given note. | | ***Credit*** | defines the person who is the author of the given vulnerability as presented and described in the WLB safety note. | | ***Risk*** | is a variable defining the total threat which can result from a given item of information. The criterion marking one of three levels, it is possible to use that information as well as the number of machines with the defective code. | | ***Remote/Local*** | define the manner of the vulnerability utilization as each machine can be attacked form the outside or from the internal level. These are quite important parameters since they tell us about the tactical utilization of the given information. | | ***History*** | defines which changes were made into a given note, by whom and when. The dates define the time when that happened. | | ***References*** | is a field containing references to further information on a given vulnerability. One is permitted to enter references leading to the authors' web sites. | | ***Status*** | defines a part of the given information. The classification occurs on four levels:  | ***Bug*** | this informs that a note refers to the vulnerability present in a given application. Each item of information with this status states that a given vulnerability has taken place or is taking place at present. | | --- | --- | | ***Bogus*** | each item of information with this status has a task to negate the existence of the false information. The use of this status is permitted in the case of a mistake or in order to countercheck the expansion of unnecessary panic. | | ***Trick*** | all information with this status are of the character which proves a lack of cohesion among programmers, a possibility of an attack because of a bad configuration, a presentation of a new aspect of avoiding protections or (unnecessary) philosophical disputes on the theory of machine safety. | | ***Exploits*** | this informs that a note refers to the *exploit* or *PoC (Proof of Concept)* present in a given application. | | | ***CVE*** | are unique, common identifiers for publicly known information security vulnerabilities. | | ***CWE*** | is a formal list of software weakness types created to serve as a common language for describing software security weaknesses in architecture, design, or code. |   ---   **4. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)** A list of standardized names for vulnerabilities and other information security exposures - CVE aims to standardize the names for all publicly known vulnerabilities and security exposures. **CVE is:**    **-** One standardized name for each vulnerability or exposure    **-** The way to interoperability and better security coverage    **-** A basis for evaluation among tools and databases    **-** Industry-endorsed via the CVE Editorial Board and CVE-compatible products and services   **-** Free to the public on the CVE Web site The CVE ID of a vulnerability, if available, is displayed in the "Details" tab of the WLB2 Database. Users can search the entire vulnerability database for vulnerability records matching a particular CVE Identifiers:[http://cxsecurity.com/cve/](https://cxsecurity.com/cve/) In order to refer to a CVE number, one is allowed to use the following syntax:[http://cxsecurity.com/cve/[CVE-YYYY-NNNN]](https://cxsecurity.com/cve/) To see only security alerts related with CVE:[http://cxsecurity.com/cvelist/](https://cxsecurity.com/cvelist/) [CVE COMP](https://cxsecurity.com/images/MITRE/cxsecurity_cve_certificate_of_compatibility.jpg "CXSECURITY and CVE") ---   **5. Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)** *Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)* is a formal list of software weakness types created to **-** Serve as a common language for describing software security weaknesses in architecture, design, or code.   **-** Serve as a standard measuring stick for software security tools targeting these weaknesses.   **-** Provide a common baseline standard for weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts.  | ***[CWE-89](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html "CWE-89")*** | SQL injection attacks are another instantiation of injection attack, in which SQL commands are injected into data-plane input in order to effect the execution of predefined SQL commands. [See examples...](https://cxsecurity.com/cwe/CWE-89 "CWE-89 examples") | | --- | --- | | ***[CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html "CWE-79")*** | Cross-site scripting (XSS) weakness occurs when dynamically generated web pages display input, such as login information, that is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to embed malicious scripts into the generated page and then execute the script on the machine of any user that views the site. If successful, Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities can be exploited to manipulate or steal cookies, create requests that can be mistaken for those of a valid user, compromise confidential information, or execute malicious code on the end user systems for a variety of nefarious purposes. [See examples...](https://cxsecurity.com/cwe/CWE-79 "CWE-79 examples") | | ***[CWE-119](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html "CWE-119")*** | A buffer overflow condition exists when a program attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold or when a program attempts to put data in a memory area past a buffer. In this case, a buffer is a sequential section of memory allocated to contain anything from a character string to an array of integers. [See examples...](https://cxsecurity.com/cwe/CWE-119 "CWE-119 examples") | | ***[CWE-98](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/98.html "CWE-98")*** | A PHP product uses "require" or "include" statements, or equivalent statements, that use attacker-controlled data to identify code or HTML to be directly processed by the PHP interpreter before inclusion in the script. [See examples...](https://cxsecurity.com/cwe/CWE-98 "CWE-98 examples") | | ***[CWE-548](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/548.html "CWE-548")*** | A directory listing is innapropriately exposed yielding potentially sensitive information to attackers. [See examples...](https://cxsecurity.com/cwe/CWE-548 "CWE-548 examples") | | ***[CWE-352](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html "CWE-352")*** | The web product does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request. CSRF is multi-channel: 1. Attacker-to-victim (injection; external or internal channel) 2. Victim-to-server (activation; internal channel) [See examples...](https://cxsecurity.com/cwe/CWE-352 "CWE-352 examples") |   In order to refer to a CWE number, one is allowed to use the following syntax:[http://cxsecurity.com/cwe/[CWE-NNN]](https://cxsecurity.com/cwe/) CWE Dictionary is available at:[http://cxsecurity.com/allcwe/](https://cxsecurity.com/allcwe/) To see only security alerts related with CWE:[http://cxsecurity.com/cwelist/](https://cxsecurity.com/cwelist/) To find CWE, use search engine:[http://cxsecurity.com/search/](https://cxsecurity.com/search/) [CVE COMP](https://cxsecurity.com/images/MITRE/cxsecurity_cwe_certificate_of_compatibility.jpg "CXSECURITY and CWE")    --- |

| [CVE-2024-50066](https://cxsecurity.com/cveshow/CVE-2024-50066/ "CVE-2024-50066") | [In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mm/mremap: fix move\_normal\_pmd/retract\_page\_tables race In mremap(), move\_page\_tables() looks at the type of the PMD entry and the specified address range to figure out by which method the next chunk of page table entries should be moved.

At that point, the mmap_lock is held in write mode, but no rmap locks are held yet.  For PMD entries that point to page tables and are fully covered by the source address range, move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...) is called, which first takes rmap locks, then does move_normal_pmd().  move_normal_pmd() takes the necessary page table locks at source and destination, then moves an entire page table from the source to the destination.  The problem is: The rmap locks, which protect against concurrent page table removal by retract_page_tables() in the THP code, are only taken after the PMD entry has been read and it has been decided how to move it.  So we can race as follows (with two processes that have mappings of the same tmpfs file that is stored on a tmpfs mount with huge=advise); note that process A accesses page tables through the MM while process B does it through the file rmap:  process A                      process B =========                      ========= mremap   mremap_to     move_vma       move_page_tables         get_old_pmd         alloc_new_pmd                       *** PREEMPT ***                                madvise(MADV_COLLAPSE)                                  do_madvise                                    madvise_walk_vmas                                      madvise_vma_behavior                                        madvise_collapse                                          hpage_collapse_scan_file                                            collapse_file                                              retract_page_tables                                                i_mmap_lock_read(mapping)                                                pmdp_collapse_flush                                                i_mmap_unlock_read(mapping)         move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...)           take_rmap_locks           move_normal_pmd           drop_rmap_locks  When this happens, move_normal_pmd() can end up creating bogus PMD entries in the line `pmd_populate(mm, new_pmd, pmd_pgtable(pmd))`.  The effect depends on arch-specific and machine-specific details; on x86, you can end up with physical page 0 mapped as a page table, which is likely exploitable for user->kernel privilege escalation.  Fix the race by letting process B recheck that the PMD still points to a page table after the rmap locks have been taken.  Otherwise, we bail and let the caller fall back to the PTE-level copying path, which will then bail immediately at the pmd_none() check.  Bug reachability: Reaching this bug requires that you can create shmem/file THP mappings - anonymous THP uses different code that doesn't zap stuff under rmap locks.  File THP is gated on an experimental config flag (CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS), so on normal distro kernels you need shmem THP to hit this bug.  As far as I know, getting shmem THP normally requires that you can mount your own tmpfs with the right mount flags, which would require creating your own user+mount namespace; though I don't know if some distros maybe enable shmem THP by default or something like that.  Bug impact: This issue can likely be used for user->kernel privilege escalation when it is reachable.") |  |

# Exploit Author: Malcrove
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.beyondtrust.com/
# Version: v6.0 and earlier versions
# CVE: CVE-2021-31589
Summary:
Unauthenticated cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in BeyondTrust Secure Remote Access Base Software through 6.0.1 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML. Remote attackers could acheive full admin access to the appliance, by tricking the administrator into creating a new admin account through an XSS/CSRF attack involving a crafted request to the /appliance/users?action=edit endpoint.
Vulnerability Details:
Affected Endpoint: /appliance/login
Affected Parameter: login[password]
Request Method: GET or POST
Proof of concept (POC):
By navigating to the below link from a modern web browser, alert(document.domain) Javascript method would be fired in the same context of Beyondtrust Remote Support domain.
