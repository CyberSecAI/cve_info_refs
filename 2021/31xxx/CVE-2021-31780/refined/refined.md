The provided content is related to CVE-2021-31780.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how MISP handles sharing groups when editing objects associated with an event. Specifically, when an object is edited and has a sharing group associated, the system was incorrectly ignoring the provided sharing group object and instead reusing a local ID, leading to potential misassociation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect handling of sharing groups:** During object edits, the system was not properly processing the sharing group data, leading to an incorrect association.
- **Potential for misassociation:** The local ID reuse could lead to the object being associated with the wrong sharing group.
- **Bypass of authorization checks**: When a sharing group is provided via `SharingGroup`, the application doesn't check if the user is authorized to actually use that sharing group. It only checks authorization when a `sharing_group_id` is provided.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Leakage:**  Objects might be shared with incorrect sharing groups, potentially exposing data to unauthorized users.
- **Data Corruption:**  The misassociation could also result in the incorrect data management.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Editing Objects:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by editing an object associated with an event and manipulating the sharing group information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a user of the MISP platform with the ability to edit objects and modify their sharing groups, within the scope of their permissions.
