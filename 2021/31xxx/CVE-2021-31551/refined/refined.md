Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-31551:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the insufficient HTML escaping of user-supplied input within the `PageForms` extension for MediaWiki. Specifically, the `select2` library, used for combobox and token inputs, had its default escaping mechanism overridden, leading to unsanitized user input being rendered in the HTML. This occurred due to:
  - An override of `select2`'s `escapeMarkup` function with a no-op or inadequate sanitization function in `ext.pf.select2.tokens.js` and `ext.pf.select2.combobox.js`.
  - Incomplete handling of array query string parameters, which allowed unescaped values to be passed when the `is_list` value was not set.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. Malicious scripts can be injected into form input fields or through URL parameters, which are then executed within the user's browser when the page is rendered.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code, leading to actions such as:
     - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
     - Stealing cookies and session data.
     - Defacing or modifying page content.
     - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
   - **Self-XSS:** While less severe, the vulnerability also allowed for self-XSS attacks, where users could inject malicious scripts into their own view of a page, demonstrating the potential for wider impact to less technical users

**4. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Form Input Fields:** An attacker could inject malicious code directly into form fields using combobox or tokens inputs.
   - **URL Parameters:** An attacker could craft malicious URLs with the exploit code embedded in the query string parameters.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to input data into form fields or craft URLs with malicious parameters.
   - No special privileges or position is required, as it could be exploited by any user.

**Technical Details:**

   - The `escapeMarkup` function within `ext.pf.select2.tokens.js` and `ext.pf.select2.combobox.js` was set to `function (m) { return m; }`, or `function(m) { return m.replace('<', '&lt;').replace('>', '&gt;').replace('"', '&quot;'); }` effectively disabling or bypassing proper sanitization.
   - The fix involved improving HTML escaping by using `htmlspecialchars` with `ENT_QUOTES` to ensure proper sanitization, as well as properly handling array query string parameters by using `PFFormPrinter::getStringFromPassedInArray` to sanitize values.
   - The vulnerability was present in older versions of the `PageForms` extension (e.g., 4.9.5) and was addressed with subsequent patches.

   - The issue was initially reported on the Liquipedia wiki farm and was also found to be reproducible on a local development wiki.
   - The fix included not only sanitization of form parameters but also a secondary issue of improper html escaping that was allowing HTML within bolded form outputs to execute javascript.

In summary, the CVE-2021-31551 vulnerability arises from improper handling of user-provided input within the `PageForms` extension. This allowed for XSS attacks, where malicious scripts could be injected via form input fields or through URL parameters, and be executed within the users' browser, thus allowing potential malicious actions by an attacker. The fix included improved HTML escaping and proper sanitization of URL parameter values.
