## Redmine 4.2.1, 4.1.3 and 4.0.9 released (security fixes)

Added by [Marius BÄ‚LTEANU](/users/107353) [over 3 years](/projects/redmine/activity?from=2021-04-26 "2021-04-26 22:33") ago

These 3 maintenance releases are available for [download](/projects/redmine/wiki/Download), you can review the changes in the [Changelog](/projects/redmine/wiki/Changelog).

**Security**: these 3 releases include 4 security fixes, including a critical fix for an arbitrary file read in Git adapter, so upgrading as soon as possible is highly recommended. For those who cannot update immediately, another method to mitigate the critical risk is to update the Git version from the server to at least 2.22.0. You can get more details in [Security Advisories](/projects/redmine/wiki/Security_Advisories).

Many thanks to niubl from TSRC (Tencent Security Response Center) for reporting this issue to the Redmine security team, to Holger Just from [www.plan.io](http://www.plan.io) for the hard working on these security issues and to Go Maeda who made these releases possible.

Beside this, these new versions clarify and properly fix some inconsistent permissions for `issue_edit` and `add_issue_notes`. Before [3.3.0](/versions/110), users only with `issue_edit` permission were allowed to add notes to issues by design, but this behaviour changed when tracker role-based permissions were added ([#285](/issues/285 "Feature: Tracker role-based permissioning (Closed)")) and the `add_issue_notes` was explicitly required in the UI. [4.0.8](/versions/161) extended this behaviour to API and [4.0.9](/versions/166) to mail handler. Please check your roles settings if you have the incoming email configured.

Please note that [4.0.9](/versions/166) is the last release for 4.0 series, you should upgrade to Redmine 4.1 or 4.2 to get the future maintenance updates. Next major version is [5.0.0](/versions/155).

Thanks you to everyone who took part in this release!

As always when there are security fixes, we have updated the [Redmine Security Scanner](https://plan.io/redmine-security-scanner/). If you havenâ€™t already, feel free to subscribe your Redmine for regular scanning to get email updates whenever its security status changes.

Does CVE-2021-31863 affect private projects? If I understand correctly, the bug can only be exploited when a user (anonymous or authenticated) has access to a specific project (correct me if I'm wrong). If all projects are private, this would mean that the only users capable of executing the exploit are authenticated users, correct?

thanks for Released Redmine 4.2.1

# Redmine Security Advisories[Â¶](#Redmine-Security-Advisories)

This page lists the security vulnerabilities that were fixed in Redmine releases, starting from 1.3.0. If you think that you've found a security vulnerability, please report it by sending an email to: `security(at)redmine.org`.

To detect if your own Redmine is subject to any of these vulnerabilities, you can use Planio's [Redmine Security Scanner](https://plan.io/redmine-security-scanner/).
