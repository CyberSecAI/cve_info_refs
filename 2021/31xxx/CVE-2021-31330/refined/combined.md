# Review Board 4.0 RC 2 Release Notes[¶](#review-board-4-0-rc-2-release-notes "Permalink to this heading")

**Release date**: April 14, 2021

Please see the [4.0 beta 1](../4.0-beta-1/), [4.0 beta 2](../4.0-beta-2/),
and [4.0 RC 1 release notes](../4.0-rc-1/) for general information and
upgrade notes.

These release notes show changes since RC 1.

## Installation[¶](#installation "Permalink to this heading")

To install this release, run the following:

```
$ sudo pip install \
    --trusted-host downloads.reviewboard.org \
    -f http://downloads.reviewboard.org/releases/ReviewBoard/4.0/ \
    -f http://downloads.reviewboard.org/releases/rbintegrations/2.0/ \
    --pre -U ReviewBoard

```

Or:

```
$ sudo easy_install \
    -f http://downloads.reviewboard.org/releases/ReviewBoard/4.0/ \
    -f http://downloads.reviewboard.org/releases/rbintegrations/2.0/ \
    -U ReviewBoard

```

Note

If this is a new install on Python 2.7, please use **pip**, as
support for **easy\_install** is going away.

**pip** is required for Python 3.

Warning

We **do not** recommend upgrading a production server with this version of
Review Board. It’s best to install on a test server, with a copy of your
production database, in case there are any major problems.

## Packaging[¶](#packaging "Permalink to this heading")

* [bcrypt](https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/) is capped to < 3.2 on Python 2.7.
* [pyparsing](https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/) is capped to 2.4.x on Python 2.7.

## Security Fixes[¶](#security-fixes "Permalink to this heading")

This release fixes a XSS vulnerability in Markdown rendering, which could
allow an attacker to craft a link that executes arbitrary JavaScript code when
clicked.

The attacker would need to be someone who already has legitimate access to
your server, and can perform reviews or otherwise access your code.

We recommend that everyone (especially those running public servers) upgrades
to address this vulnerability, though the seriousness of the issue will vary
from company to company.

Thanks to Matt S. for the security report.

## Removed Features[¶](#removed-features "Permalink to this heading")

* Removed the old **dumpdb** and **loaddb** management commands.

  These weren’t compatible with the version of Django used for Review Board
  4.0, and were often misused. We recommend that people use their database’s
  own SQL dump/load tools to move databases.

  We’re working on a tool for obtaining structured dumps of the database and
  performing database imports, merges, and moving between different types of
  databases. This will be available as a free feature in [Power Pack](https://www.reviewboard.org/powerpack/).

## Bug Fixes[¶](#bug-fixes "Permalink to this heading")

### Reviews[¶](#reviews "Permalink to this heading")

* Fixed an invisible Publish Review button at the top of a review
  request page.

  This could be accidentally clicked, creating empty reviews.
* The styling for inline code literals (text surrounded by backticks) in
  Markdown text fields now looks the same whether editing or viewing text.

  This has been a long-standing issue since the introduction of Markdown
  support. We’ve finally made this consistent.

### Search[¶](#search "Permalink to this heading")

* Issues communicating with the search backend will no longer cause pages or
  the API to crash.

## Contributors[¶](#contributors "Permalink to this heading")

* Christian Hammond
* Matt S

# [Review Board 3.0.21 and 4.0 RC 2: Security Fixes, Bug Fixes, and Docker](/news/2021/04/14/review-board-3-0-21-and-4-0-rc-2-security-bug-fixes-and-docker/)

## April 14, 2021

Review Board 3.0.21 and 4.0 RC 2 are out. These releases fix a security vulnerability, along with other bug fixes.

3.0.21 also introduces Docker support.

## Security Fix

Both releases fix a XSS vulnerability in Markdown rendering, which could allow an attacker to craft a link that executes arbitrary JavaScript code when clicked.

The attacker would need to be someone who already has legitimate access to your server, and can perform reviews or otherwise access your code.

We recommend that everyone (especially those running public servers) upgrades to address this vulnerability, though the seriousness of the issue will vary from company to company.

## Docker Support

Review Board 3.0.21 ships with new [Docker support](https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/manual/3.0/admin/installation/docker/), helping you set up and deploy servers quickly without need to manually install anything.

This is still young. If you hit any issues, please report them to us.

Going forward, all Review Board 3.x and higher releases will include Docker images.

## Compatibility and Bug Fixes

Both releases fix installation issues on Python 2.7, along with a handful of bug fixes and improvements.

See the [3.0.21 release notes](https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/releasenotes/reviewboard/3.0.21/) and [4.0 RC 2 release notes](https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/releasenotes/reviewboard/4.0-rc-2/) for the full lists of changes.

Keep up with the latest Review Board releases, security updates, and
helpful information.

# Review Board 3.0.21 Release Notes[¶](#review-board-3-0-21-release-notes "Permalink to this heading")

**Release date**: April 14, 2021

## Packaging[¶](#packaging "Permalink to this heading")

* [bcrypt](https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/) is capped to < 3.2.
* [pyparsing](https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/) is capped to 2.4.x.
* Added a dependency on [bleach](https://pypi.org/project/bleach/) >= 3.3.
* Added a dependency on [bleach-allowlist](https://pypi.org/project/bleach-allowlist/) >= 1.0.3.

## Security Fixes[¶](#security-fixes "Permalink to this heading")

This release fixes a XSS vulnerability in Markdown rendering, which could
allow an attacker to craft a link that executes arbitrary JavaScript code when
clicked.

The attacker would need to be someone who already has legitimate access to
your server, and can perform reviews or otherwise access your code.

We recommend that everyone (especially those running public servers) upgrades
to address this vulnerability, though the seriousness of the issue will vary
from company to company.

Thanks to Matt Schmidt for the security report.

## New Features[¶](#new-features "Permalink to this heading")

### Official Docker Support[¶](#official-docker-support "Permalink to this heading")

We now have an official [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/beanbag/reviewboard/) for Review Board. Going forward, all
releases (including betas) will come with a Docker image, ready for testing or
deployment in your network.

For now, the Docker image is also a beta. Please [read the documentation](https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/manual/3.0/admin/installation/docker/#installation-docker "(in Review Board Manual v3.0)") on setting up a container with our Docker image.

With this, Review Board can now be run via [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) and other independent
WSGI application servers by making use of a new `reviewboard.wsgi`
module. The old `htdocs/reviewboard.wsgi` script on new installs will
make use of this module. Existing versions won’t be upgraded in 3.0.x (but
will be in 4.0).

### rb-site[¶](#rb-site "Permalink to this heading")

* Added a `--allowed-host` option to
  rb-site-install to specify additional hostnames for the server.

  This can be specified multiple times.
* Improved checks and error messages when failing to install a new site
  directory at a specified location.

  There’s no longer a generic error shown if the site directory can’t be
  written to or contains existing files. The error is now tailored based on
  what failed.

## Deprecated Features[¶](#deprecated-features "Permalink to this heading")

* The **dumpdb** and **loaddb** management commands have been
  deprecated, and will be removed in Review Board 4.0.

  These commands, and the data generated by **dumpdb**, are not
  compatible with the version of Django used for Review Board 4.0. These
  were never really intended for use outside of development setups to begin
  with, and end up causing more trouble than they’re worth.

  We recommend that people use their database’s native SQL dump/restore
  tools.

  We’re also working on a successor to these tools in
  [Power Pack](https://www.reviewboard.org/powerpack/)

## Bug Fixes[¶](#bug-fixes "Permalink to this heading")

### Installation[¶](#installation "Permalink to this heading")

* Fixed having to manually run resolve a “static-media” check after
  installing a new site.
* Added a warning in the terminal that extensions are disabled if there’s
  a pending upgrade required for a site directory.

  It was otherwise confusing why management commands provided by extensions
  couldn’t be run.
