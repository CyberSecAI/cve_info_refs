- **Root cause of vulnerability**: SQL injection vulnerability in the password reset procedure of CentOS Web Panel, specifically via the `idsession` HTTP POST parameter. This allows an attacker to inject additional SQL query parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection and Command Injection vulnerabilities. The SQL injection leads to command injection via a `shell_exec` call.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote, unauthenticated attackers can gain root remote code execution on the CentOS Web Panel host.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `http://cwp.local:2083/login/index.php?acc=newpass` with a malicious `idsession` parameter containing SQL injection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target CentOS Web Panel instance. No prior authentication is needed.
