Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31408:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `Authentication.logout()` helper in `com.vaadin:flow-client` versions 5.0.0 prior to 6.0.0 (Vaadin 18), and 6.0.0 through 6.0.4 (Vaadin 19.0.0 through 19.0.3) used an incorrect HTTP method (GET) for logout.
- Spring Security, with default CSRF protection enabled, only allows HTTP POST requests for logout to invalidate the session.
- The mismatch between the HTTP method used by the `logout()` helper (GET) and the expected method by Spring Security (POST) resulted in the session not being invalidated upon logout, when CSRF protection is enabled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Incorrect HTTP Method for Logout:** The `Authentication.logout()` helper used an HTTP GET request instead of the required POST request for proper session invalidation with Spring Security's CSRF protection.
- **Insufficient Session Expiration:**  The session was not invalidated on logout when using the flawed helper method. This is explicitly noted as CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration.
- **CSRF bypass:** The incorrect HTTP method bypasses the CSRF protection.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Session persistence:**  A local attacker could potentially access Fusion endpoints after a user had attempted to log out, because the user's session was not properly invalidated.
- **Unauthorized Access:** This can lead to unauthorized access to the application's resources and data.
- **Data manipulation:** It may also enable the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the logged-out user if they are able to access and use the session.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local access:** The attacker needs local access to the machine running the vulnerable application.
- **User interaction:** The user must attempt to log out using the vulnerable `Authentication.logout()` helper.
- **Exploitation of the session:** The attacker then needs to exploit the still-active session to access protected resources.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Local machine access:** The attacker must have access to the machine where the vulnerable application is deployed.
- **Knowledge of the application:** The attacker needs to be aware that the application uses the vulnerable `Authentication.logout()` helper.
- **Ability to exploit session:** Attacker needs to have the ability to use the still valid session to gain access to sensitive resources.

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability is specific to applications using Fusion and Spring Security with default CSRF protection for logout.
- The fix involves correcting the HTTP method used by the `Authentication.logout()` helper to use POST.
- The issue is resolved in Vaadin 19.0.4 and later. Vaadin 18 is no longer supported.
- The vulnerability is categorized as medium severity with a base score of 6.3 due to the local access requirement.
