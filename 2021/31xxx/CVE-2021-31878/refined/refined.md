Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-31878:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `res_pjsip_session.c` module of Asterisk.
- It occurs when Asterisk receives a re-INVITE message without Session Description Protocol (SDP) data after the system has already sent a BYE request.
- The code assumes that the Asterisk channel is still present and tries to access it, which results in a crash due to the channel no longer existing, specifically when `ast_queue_unhold(session->channel)` is called with a NULL `session->channel`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core issue is a null pointer dereference. The code attempts to access the channel via `session->channel` without properly validating that the channel is still valid/exists.
- This happens because after sending a BYE, the channel can be deallocated, but the code logic in `session_inv_on_create_offer` doesn't check for this scenario.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact of this vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS).
- An attacker can cause a crash of the Asterisk service. This is due to the NULL pointer dereference causing Asterisk to log assertion failures, and then terminate.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a remote authenticated session.
- An authenticated SIP user is required to send a specific sequence of messages to trigger the crash, specifically a re-INVITE without SDP after Asterisk sends a BYE request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user able to send SIP messages to the Asterisk server.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the required message sequence to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in a commit that aimed to fix a different issue (ASTERISK-28452).
- Patches are available for Asterisk versions 16 and 18.
- The vulnerability is considered to be of "Moderate" severity.
-  The issue was introduced in the commit fixing ASTERISK-28452 ("res\_pjsip\_session: Always produce offer on re-INVITE without SDP"). The new pjsip callback added in the commit (session\_inv\_on\_create\_offer) assumes that ast\_sip\_session always has a channel.
