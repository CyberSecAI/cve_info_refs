- When combined with other vulnerabilities, it can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of SYSTEM.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-adjacent attackers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable Exchange Server.
- User interaction is required, although the specifics of this interaction are not detailed.
- The attacker would need to exploit this vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to gain arbitrary code execution.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in the handling of Exchange Server Help updates.
