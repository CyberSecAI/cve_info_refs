Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-31580:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command, specifically when using the `exec` command within the restricted shell environment of the Akkadian Appliance Manager component. The restricted shell environment is triggered via the `/home/akkadianuser/.bashrc` configuration file which invokes the `akkadianAppManager` shell via sudo. This allows an attacker to bypass the restricted shell when providing a single execution parameter via ssh and gain access to the underlying bash shell.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation within the restricted shell environment when handling `exec` command calls.
- The interactive python script fails to find `/dev/tty` file and exits, which leads to a failed exit condition, but does not fail the parent bash shell and passes the command to the OS.
- The restricted shell environment is not directly set to the restricted shell binary, and is instead set to bash, which can be bypassed with the procedure outlined below.
-  The `akkadianuser` has unrestricted sudo privileges without a password.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain an unrestricted, interactive root shell on the affected system.
- This can lead to complete system compromise, including the installation of malware, data exfiltration, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based exploitation via SSH.
- The attacker must first authenticate using the hardcoded credentials for the `hakkadianuser` account.
- The attacker can then utilize the `exec` command to escape the restricted shell environment.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the SSH port of the affected Akkadian Provisioning Manager device.
- Knowledge of the hardcoded `hakkadianuser` credentials.
- Ability to initiate an SSH connection and send commands.

**Additional Information**
- The vulnerability was found in Akkadian Provisioning Manager version 4.50.18
- The issue is addressed in version 5.1.0
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-78.
