CVE-2021-31987

Affected Axis products & solutions

CVE-2021-31987

  Axis devices with AXIS OS 5.51 or later

Overview

An external research team has found a flaw in the test functions of the
TCP-,HTTP- and SMTP-recipient handling of the built-in event system in Axis
devices. The vulnerability was discovered by Andrea Palanca from Nozomi
Networks Inc.

CVE-2021-31987

The test functionalities of HTTP, email, and TCP recipients have blocklist-
based security checks to impede interactions with localhost-exposed network
services which were possible to be  circumvented with known bypasses.
Furthermore, the test functionality of HTTP recipients did not prevent the
user to define URLs with other schemes (e.g., “file://”). Finally, the test
functionality of HTTPS recipients used the same checks designed for HTTP
recipients only, which, as a consequence, were completely ineffective for
HTTPS URLs.

Risk assessment

A potential adversary needs to have network access and administrator level
access to the Axis device to exploit the vulnerability or needs to deceive
a victim with administrator level access into visiting a specifically
crafted webpage while logged in. He/she also requires some level of
technical skills and motivation.

Action Plan

Axis will release patches on the following AXIS OS tracks:

  Active track 10.8
  2016 LTS track 6.50.5.5
  2018 LTS track 8.40.4.3
  2020 LTS track 9.80.3.5
  5.51.7.5

The release notes will state the following:

Corrected CVE-2021-31987. For more information, please visit the Axis product
