Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31407:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the combination of:

1.  **OSGi HTTP Whiteboard Specification Behavior:** The specification makes all resources within a bundle/JAR accessible through the `ServletContext` class for any registered servlet in the same bundle/JAR. This is intended behavior within the OSGi context.
2.  **VaadinServlet Resource Exposure:** The `VaadinServlet` class, specifically through the `StaticFileServer` class, exposes all resources available in the `ServletContext` via HTTP.

In Vaadin OSGi applications, when a `VaadinServlet` is registered using the HTTP Whiteboard, it inadvertently exposes all resources within its bundle's `ServletContext`. This includes Java class files and static resources, making them accessible through the browser if their exact URL is known.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Resource Leak (CWE-402):** Private resources (like Java class files, configuration files, and other sensitive assets) within the application bundle are exposed to the public web, leading to a resource leak.
*   **Unintended Resource Exposure:** The `VaadinServlet` doesn't properly restrict access to resources within the `ServletContext` when used in an OSGi environment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive information, including:
    *   Java class files, which can be decompiled to reveal application logic.
    *   Configuration files containing secrets, database connection details, etc.
    *   Any other static resources within the bundle.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:**  The disclosed information can aid in planning more targeted attacks on the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted HTTP Requests:** An attacker needs to send a direct HTTP request to the exact URL of the desired resource within the bundle/JAR.
*   **URL Discovery:** The attacker must know (or discover) the URL paths for the resources they wish to access. This could be aided by identifying an entry point in the system providing further information on accessible resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application server.
*   **Knowledge of Resource URLs (or an entry point that reveals them):** The attacker must know or discover the URL paths to access the desired resources within the application bundle.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is specific to Vaadin OSGi applications using the vulnerable versions of `com.vaadin:flow-server`.
*   Non-OSGi Vaadin applications are not affected due to the different way `ServletContext` resources are handled.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in Vaadin versions 14.4.10+, 19.0.1+ by preventing `StaticFileServer` from exposing ServletContext resources.
*   The provided content includes links to the related GitHub issues and pull requests, which provide additional technical context on how the vulnerability was fixed.
