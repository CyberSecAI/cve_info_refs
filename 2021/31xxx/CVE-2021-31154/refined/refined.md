The provided content is related to CVE-2021-31154.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `pleaseedit` utility uses predictable temporary file names in `/tmp` and the target directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Predictable temporary file paths are generated using `tmp_edit_file_name()` and `source_tmp_file_name()`.
- Missing `O_NOFOLLOW` flag when calling `openat()` on the generated temporary files in `/tmp`, making it vulnerable to symlink attacks.
- Lack of unpredictable file names created in a `mkstemp()` manner.
- `chown()` is called on the temporary file in `/tmp` before a possible race condition allowing for local root exploit if not for symlink protection mechanism.
- In the target directory, `pleaseedit` follows symlinks when creating temporary copies.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- If a regular user is allowed to edit any file via `pleaseedit`, an attacker could potentially overwrite arbitrary files and change their ownership if symlink protections are not in place.
- If a target directory is controlled by a non-root user, privilege escalation could occur.
- Local root exploit is possible if a race condition is won.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploiting predictable file names in `/tmp` via symlink attacks.
- Exploiting the lack of `O_NOFOLLOW` flag when opening temporary files in `/tmp`.
- Exploiting symlink following in target directories where temporary copies are created.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be a local user who is allowed to use the `pleaseedit` command to edit files.
- The attacker needs to create symlinks in `/tmp` to the files they wish to overwrite.
- The attacker needs to be in control of the target directory if exploiting symlink following there.
