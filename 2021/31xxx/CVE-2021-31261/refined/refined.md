Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `isom_hinter.c` file of the GPAC project. Specifically, the issue was located in the `gf_hinter_track_new` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The code had a conditional block where the `esd` variable was deallocated using `gf_odf_desc_del((GF_Descriptor*)esd);` if the `esd` variable was defined. However, there was another conditional block where it could be deallocated, resulting in a double free. There was no check to ensure the `esd` was defined before attempting to free it a second time.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The primary impact of this vulnerability is a memory leak. The double free could lead to heap corruption and potential crashes.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered when processing MP4 files using the `MP4Box` tool, specifically when handling hinted tracks. The attacker can provide a specially crafted MP4 file that triggers the vulnerable code path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious MP4 file to the `MP4Box` tool.

**Additional details:**
- The commit `cd3738dea038dbd12e603ad48cd7373ae0440f65` addresses the memory leak by removing the redundant `gf_odf_desc_del` call.
- The related issue is #1737.
- The fix was done by removing an additional `gf_odf_desc_del` from the `gf_hinter_track_new` function of `isom_hinter.c`.
