- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-based buffer overflow in the read callback function of the "libhttp_smtp_notify.so" library. The read callback function failed to verify that no more than "size" multiplied by "items" bytes are copied into the libcurl destination buffer, as required by libcurl documentation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient input validation of the "to", "from", "subject", and "body" HTTP parameters before they are copied into the libcurl buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A heap-based buffer overflow leading to potential remote code execution or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted request to the `/axis-cgi/smtptest.cgi` endpoint, specifically when the "Test" button of the "New recipient" tab is clicked in the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Network access to the Axis device.
    - Administrator-level access to the Axis device, or the ability to deceive a user with administrator-level access into visiting a specially crafted web page while logged in.
    -  Some level of technical skills and motivation.
