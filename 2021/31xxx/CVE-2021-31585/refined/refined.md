Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-31585:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability of a user with administrative privileges to generate SSH passwords that provide local access to the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Privilege Escalation: An authenticated user with admin privileges can escalate their access to the system, obtaining local access, which is typically reserved for higher-level administrators or the system itself.
- Insecure SSH Password Generation: The system's process for generating SSH passwords is flawed. This flaw allows the created passwords to be exploited to gain local access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Local Access: A user with administrative privileges can gain local access, which could then lead to further unauthorized activities within the system. This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, or disrupt the service.
- Privilege Escalation:  The exploitation enables a user with admin privileges to effectively escalate to a higher level, potentially a root user or system level access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting the SSH password generation process by a user who already possesses administrative privileges within the Kiteworks system.
- An attacker who has compromised an administrator account will be able to use this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must possess valid administrative-level credentials to access the Kiteworks system.
- The attacker needs to be able to navigate to the function/interface that allows SSH password generation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Kiteworks versions 7.3.0 and earlier.
- It is addressed in version 7.3.1 and later.
