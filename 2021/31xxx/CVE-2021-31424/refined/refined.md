Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-31424

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length within the Parallels Desktop Open Tools Gate component. Specifically, the application fails to check the length of data before copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Heap-based buffer overflow: The vulnerability lies in copying a user-controlled amount of data into a fixed size buffer on the heap without proper bounds checking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Privilege Escalation: Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to elevate their privileges and execute arbitrary code within the context of the hypervisor.
*   Arbitrary Code Execution: An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution within the hypervisor's context.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Local Access: The attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the guest operating system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Low-privileged code execution within the guest system.
*   Ability to provide crafted input to the vulnerable component.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is located in the Open Tools Gate component of Parallels Desktop.
*   Parallels has released an update to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Reno Robert of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
