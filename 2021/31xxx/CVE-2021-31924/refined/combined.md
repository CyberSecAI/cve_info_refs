This module implements PAM over U2F and FIDO2, providing an easy way to integrate the
YubiKey (or other U2F/FIDO2 compliant authenticators) into your existing
infrastructure.

## Building

You may get signed release tarballs from Yubicoâs
[release page](https://developers.yubico.com/pam-u2f/Releases).

This project uses *autoconf*, *automake*, *pkg-config* and *libtool*
to achieve portability and ease of use.

In addition, [*libfido2*](https://developers.yubico.com/libfido2) (>=
1.3.0) is needed. Versions of this project up to 1.0.8 used
`libu2f-host` and `libu2f-server`. On Ubuntu, the necessary dependencies can be
installed using

```
# apt install --no-install-recommends autoconf automake libtool pkg-config \
    libfido2-dev libpam-dev libssl-dev

```

If you downloaded a tarball, build it as follows.

```
$ ./configure
$ make

```

## Building from Git

You may check out the sources using Git with the following command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Yubico/pam-u2f.git

```

This will create a directory *pam-u2f*. Enter the directory:

```
$ cd pam-u2f

```

`autoconf`, `automake`, `libtool`, and `libpam` must be installed.
`AsciiDoc` and `xsltproc` are used to generate the manpages. On Ubuntu,
the necessary dependencies can be installed using

```
# apt install --no-install-recommends autoconf automake libtool \
    pkg-config libfido2-dev libpam-dev libssl-dev asciidoc xsltproc \
    libxml2-utils docbook-xml

```

On Fedora, the necessary dependencies can be installed using

```
# dnf -y install autoconf automake libtool libfido2-devel pam-devel \
    openssl-devel asciidoc

```

Generate the build system using:

```
$ autoreconf --install

```

Then build as usual, see above under [Building](#building).

## Installation

Once the module is built, copy the file `pam_u2f.so` to the correct
directory for your system. Typically `/lib/security/` or
`/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security/`. This is automated by `make install`
assuming that the pam directory chosen by `configure` is correct. If
that is not the case it can be specified with `./configure
--with-pam-dir=`.

## Service Configuration

Create a file for a new service in `/etc/pam.d/` or edit an already
existing one by adding a line similar to this:

```
auth sufficient pam_u2f.so debug
```

For more information about the syntax of PAM configuration files, please
see the manual page for pam.conf(5). Additional [example configurations](#examples) can be found below.

| Important | An erroneous PAM configuration may lock some or all users out of the system or prevent you from gaining root privileges. It is recommended that you start a separate shell with root privileges while configuring PAM to be able to revert changes if something goes wrong. Test your configuration thoroughly before closing the root shell. |
| --- | --- |

### Module Arguments

| debug | Enables debug output |
| --- | --- |
| debug\_file | Filename to write debugging messages to. **If this file is missing, nothing will be logged**. This regular file **has to be created by the user** or **must exist and be a regular file** for anything getting logged to it. It is not created by pam-u2f on purpose (for security considerations). This filename may be alternatively set to "stderr" (default), "stdout", or "syslog". |
| origin=origin | Set the relying party ID for the FIDO authentication procedure. If no value is specified, the identifier "pam://$HOSTNAME" is used. |
| appid=appid | Set the [application ID](https://developers.yubico.com/U2F/App_ID.html) for the FIDO authentication procedure. If no value is specified, the same value used for origin is taken ("pam://$HOSTNAME" if also origin is not specified). This setting is only applicable for U2F credentials created with pamu2fcfg versions v1.0.8 or earlier. Note that on v1.1.0 and v1.1.1 of pam-u2f, handling of this setting was temporarily broken if the value was not the same as the value of origin. |
| authfile=file | Set the location of the [file that holds the mappings of user names to keyHandles and user keys](#authMappingFiles). An [individual (per user) file](#individualAuth) may be configured relative to the users' home dirs, e.g. ".ssh/u2f\_keys". If not specified, the location defaults to $XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME/Yubico/u2f\_keys. If $XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME is not set, $HOME/.config/Yubico/u2f\_keys is used. |
| expand | Enables variable expansion within the authfile path: `%u` is expanded to the local user name (`PAM_USER`) and `%%` is expanded to `%`. Unknown expansion sequences result in an authentication error. See also `openasuser`. |
| authpending\_file=file | Set the location of the file that is used for touch request notifications. This file will be opened when pam-u2f starts waiting for a user to touch the device, and will be closed when it no longer waits for a touch. Use inotify to listen on these events, or a more high-level tool like [yubikey-touch-detector](https://github.com/maximbaz/yubikey-touch-detector). Note that yubikey-touch-detector v1.5.1 and later no longer rely on the authpending file for its detection mechanism. Set an empty value in order to disable this functionality, like so: `authpending_file=`. Default value: /var/run/user/$UID/pam-u2f-authpending |
| nouserok | Set to make authentication attempts not fail if the user trying to authenticate is not found inside `authfile`, is found but has no credentials, or if the `authfile` is missing. |
| openasuser | Setuid to the authenticating user when opening the authfile. Useful when the userâs home is stored on an NFS volume mounted with the `root_squash` option (which maps root to nobody which will not be able to read the file). Note that after release 1.0.8 this is done by default when no global authfile (path is absolute) or XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME environment variable has been set. |
| alwaysok | Set to enable all authentication attempts to succeed (aka presentation mode). |
| max\_devices=n\_devices | Maximum number of devices (credentials) allowed per user (default is 24). Devices specified in the authorization mapping file that exceed this value will be ignored. |
| interactive | Set to prompt a message and wait before testing the presence of a FIDO device. Recommended if your device doesnât have a tactile trigger. |
| [prompt=your prompt here] | Set individual prompt message for interactive mode. Watch the square brackets around this parameter to get spaces correctly recognized by PAM. |
| manual | Set to drop to a manual console where challenges are printed on screen and response read from standard input. Useful for debugging and SSH sessions without U2F-support from the SSH client/server. If enabled, interactive mode becomes redundant and has no effect. |
| cue | Set to prompt a message to remind to touch the device. |
| [cue\_prompt=your prompt here] | Set individual prompt message for the cue option. Watch the square brackets around this parameter to get spaces correctly recognized by PAM. |
| nodetect | Set to skip detecting if a suitable FIDO token is inserted before performing the full tactile authentication. This detection was created to avoid emitting the "cue" message if no suitable token exists, because doing so leaks information about the authentication stack if a token is inserted but not configured for the authenticating user. However, it was found that versions of `libu2f-host` 1.1.5 or less has buggy iteration/sleep behavior which causes a 1-second delay to occur for this initial detection. For this reason, as well as the possibility of hypothetical tokens that do not tolerate this double authentication, the "nodetect" option was added. |
| userpresence=int | If 1, request user presence during authentication. If 0, do not request user presence during authentication. If omitted, fallback to the authenticatorâs default behaviour. |
| userverification=int | If 1, request user verification during authentication (e.g. biometrics). If 0, do not request user verification during authentication. If omitted, fallback to the authenticatorâs default behaviour. If enabled, an authenticator with support for FIDO2 user verification is required. |
| pinverification=int | If 1, request PIN verification during authentication. If 0, do not request PIN verification during authentication. If omitted, fallback to the authenticatorâs default behaviour. If enabled, an authenticator with support for a FIDO2 PIN is required. |
| sshformat | Use credentials produced by versions of OpenSSH that have support for FIDO devices. It is not possible to mix native credentials and SSH credentials. Once this option is enabled all credentials will be parsed as SSH. |

| Important | On dynamic networks (e.g. where hostnames are set by DHCP), users should not rely on the default origin and appid ("pam://$HOSTNAME") but set those parameters explicitly to the same value. |
| --- | --- |

### Example Service Configurations

#### Second Factor Authentication

Configure pam-u2f as a `required` module after your primary authentication
module(s) for use as a second factor. Make sure that the primary authentication
method is not `sufficient` or uses other control values that may preempt
execution of pam-u2f.

```

Primary authentication method(s) above this line.
auth required pam_u2f.so authfile=/etc/u2f_mappings cue

```

#### Passwordless Authentication

For a passwordless experience, where the authenticator PIN can be used in place
of the user password, you can insert the below line towards the top of your
service configuration. You may need to change the control value to something
else if youâd like to execute additional authentication modules after pam-u2f.

```

auth sufficient pam_u2f.so authfile=/etc/u2f_mappings cue pinverification=1
Fallback modules go below this line (e.g. password authentication).

```

#### Passwordless Authentication using Biometrics

Similar to the previous configuration but capable of built-in user
verification, e.g. fingerprint matching using the YubiKey Bio. This example
falls back to using PIN verification if the fingerprint does not match or is
otherwise blocked.

```

auth sufficient pam_u2f.so authfile=/etc/u2f_mappings cue pinverification=0 userverification=1
auth sufficient pam_u2f.so authfile=/etc/u2f_mappings cue pinverification=1 userverification=0
More fallback modules go below this line (e.g. password authentication).

```

## Authorization Mapping Files

A mapping must be made between the YubiKey token and the user name,
see [here](#registration) for details on how to perform the
registration using the bundled tool.

There are two ways to do this, either centrally in one file, or
individually, where users can create the mapping in their home
directories. If the central authorization mapping file is being used,
user home directory mappings will not be used and the opposite applies
if user home directory mappings are being used, the central
authorization mappings file will not be used.

By default the mapping file inside a home directory will be opened as
the target user, whereas the central file will be opened as `root`. If
the `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` variable is set, privileges will not be dropped
unless the `openasuser` configuration setting is set.

| Important | Using pam-u2f to secure the login to a computer while storing the mapping file in an encrypted home directory, will result in the impossibility of logging into the system. The partition is decrypted after login and the mapping file can not be accessed. |
| --- | --- |

### Central Authorization Mapping

Create a file e.g. `/etc/u2f_mappings`. The file must contain a user
name, and the information obtained during the registration procedure.

The mappings should look like this, one per line:

```
<username1>:<KeyHandle1>,<UserKey1>,<CoseType1>,<Options1>:<KeyHandle2>,<UserKey2>,<CoseType2>,<Options2>:...
<username2>:<KeyHandle1>,<UserKey1>,<CoseType1>,<Options1>:<KeyHandle2>,<UserKey2>,<CoseType2>,<Options2>:...
```

Now add `authfile=/etc/u2f_mappings` to your PAM configuration line,
so it looks like:

```
auth sufficient pam_u2f.so authfile=/etc/u2f_mappings
```

If you do not set the `openasuser` setting, the authfile will be
opened and parsed as `root` so make sure it has the correct owner and
permissions set.

### Individual Authorization Mapping by User

Each user creates a â.config/Yubico/u2f\_keys` (default) file inside
their home directory and places the mapping in that file. You may want
to specify a different per-user file (relative to the usersâ home
directory), i.e. `.ssh/u2f_keys`. Bear in mind, setting an absolute path
here is possible although very likely a fragile setup, and probably
not exhibiting the intended behaviour.

The file must have only one line:

```
<username>:<KeyHandle1>,<UserKey1>,<CoseType1>,<Options1>:<KeyHandle2>,<UserKey2>,<CoseType2>,<Options2>:...
```

This is much the same concept as the SSH authorized\_keys file.

In this case, pam-u2f will drop privileges and read the mapping file
as that user. This happens regardless of the `openasuser` option being
set.

Note that if you set the `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` variable, privileges will not
be dropped by default. Consider also setting `openasuser` in that
case.

### Obtaining Key Handles and Public Keys

In order to obtain the required information for the authentication procedure,
a token should be first registered. This can be done by using the command line
configuration tool provided with the module:

```
$ pamu2fcfg -uusername -opam://myorigin -ipam://myappid

```

the tool will register a connected token by using the specified origin
and appid. If neither are specified they will default to
`pam://$HOSTNAME`. Additionally, it is possible to set other options
to require user presence (touch), PIN verification and resident
credentials. On success the tool prints to standard output a
configuration line that can be directly used with the module. For
additional information on the tool read the relative manpage (`man
pamu2fcfg`).

For authenticator management (e.g. setting a PIN, enrolling fingerprints, and
more), please refer to
[`fido2-token`](https://developers.yubico.com/libfido2/Manuals/fido2-token.html),
[`yubikey-manager`](https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager), or some other
suitable tool.

### SSH Credentials

To generate SSH credentials OpenSSH version 8.2 or later is required.
It is then possible to generate a credential file with:

```
$ ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk -f ./credential.ssh

```

Supported key types are ecdsa-sk and ed25519-sk. Note that passphrase protected
credentials are currently not supported.

To use this credential the `authfile` parameter should be set to the path of
the file `credential.ssh` and the `sshformat` option should also be set. If the
`authfile` parameter is not set, it defaults to `~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk`.

### Multiple Devices

Multiple devices (credentials) are supported. If more than one credential is
specified, authentication against them is attempted sequentially as they are
defined in the authorization mapping file. If during an authentication attempt
a connected device is removed or a new device is plugged in, the authentication
restarts from the top of the list.

## SELinux Note

Due to an issue with Fedora Linux, and possibly with other
distributions that use SELinux, a system configured with pam-u2f may
end up in a situation where access to the credentials file is denied.
If the `nouserok` option is also set, this will result in a successful
authentication within the module, without using the FIDO
authenticator.

In order to correctly update the security context the command
`fixfiles onboot` should be used on existing installations

Moreover, to allow read access to an authfile or directory placed in a
non-standard location, the command

```
# chcon -R -t auth_home_t /path/to/target

```

should be used.

For more information see
[HERE](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-24612).

## FIDO U2F vs FIDO2

Devices that solely support FIDO U2F and not FIDO2, e.g. the YubiKey 4 series,
can be used only in conjunction with compatible features. Enabling incompatible
features, such as setting the `+pin` or the `+verification` flags in the
`authfile` or the corresponding options in the PAM service configuration causes
the device to be ignored.

  ## ****Security Advisory YSA-2021-03 – Local PIN bypass in pam-u2f****

  Published Date: 2021-05-19
  Tracking IDs: YSA-2021-03
  CVE: [CVE-2021-31924](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-31924)

  ### Summary

  A security update for pam-u2f resolves a logic issue that, depending on the pam-u2f configuration and the application used, could lead to a local PIN bypass. This issue does not allow user presence (touch) or cryptographic signature verification to be bypassed, so an attacker would still need to physically possess and interact with the YubiKey or another enrolled authenticator.

  If pam-u2f is configured to require PIN authentication, and the application using pam-u2f allows the user to submit NULL as the PIN, pam-u2f will attempt to perform a FIDO2 authentication without PIN. If this authentication is successful, the PIN requirement is bypassed.

  ### Affected software

  Users relying on PIN authentication and using pam-u2f version 1.1.0 are potentially affected. See Issue details for more details based on use case.

  ### Not affected devices

  This does not affect any previous or current generation YubiKey Series, YubiKey FIPS Series, Security Key Series, or YubiHSM devices.

  ### How to tell if you are affected

  #### 1. Check the version of pam-u2f on your system

  If you have installed pam-u2f via apt or followed our [Ubuntu Linux Login Guide](https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016649099-Ubuntu-Linux-Login-Guide-U2F), check the version of pam-u2f on your system by running:

  `$ apt list libpam-u2f`

  If you have installed from source, check the source NEWS file for version notes.

  #### 2. Check if PIN authentication is configured

  To check if PIN authentication is being used, run:

  `$ grep -q +pin ~/.config/Yubico/u2f_keys && echo PIN is being used.`

  ### Customer Actions

  Yubico recommends that affected customers upgrade to the [latest version of pam-u2f](https://developers.yubico.com/pam-u2f/Releases/).

  ### Issue Details

  #### **Background**

  Due to the way PAM modules and encompassing applications interact, pam-u2f returns the execution flow to the application when it needs to prompt the user for a PIN. If the application allows the user to perform an action that causes a NULL PIN to be returned to pam-u2f, pam-u2f will drop the PIN requirement and proceed with a FIDO2 authentication without PIN. The user will be prompted for user presence verification, then be logged in without having specified a PIN, contrary to the user’s expectations.

  pam-u2f works on macOS, Linux, and other UNIX-like operating systems. Official support is available for Linux. The difficulty to exploit these vulnerabilities varies depending on the type of application in use. An attacker would need to both cause a NULL PIN to be sent to pam-u2f and physically interact with the enrolled authenticator.

  ### **Aggregate Severity Rating**

  Yubico has rated this issue as Moderate. It has a CVSS score of [6.8](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1)

  The attacker must cause an application to provide a NULL PIN to pam-u2f and still interact with the enrolled authenticator for the user presence verification.

  ## **Acknowledgements**

  On April 23, 2021 Kamil Jońca notified Yubico of this security issue. We thank Kamil for reporting this issue.
