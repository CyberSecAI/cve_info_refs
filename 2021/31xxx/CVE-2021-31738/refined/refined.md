- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient user input validation and escaping in the login form fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the victim's browser, potentially leading to malicious actions like session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the login page (`/login.php`) with malicious JavaScript code injected into the "uname" (username) and "pass" (password) fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable web application. No prior authentication is needed. The user must visit the crafted link or webpage with the malicious code for it to execute in their browser.
