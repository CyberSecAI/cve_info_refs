The provided content is related to CVE-2021-31745.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the ability to arbitrarily set the "PHPSESSID" cookie, which is used for maintaining administrative login sessions. Pluck CMS does not validate or regenerate session IDs properly, leading to session fixation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Session fixation vulnerability: The application allows the user to set the session ID to an arbitrary value, instead of generating it server-side.
- Lack of session invalidation: Pluck does not invalidate prior sessions after a password change.
- Lack of proper session timeout: Initially, the application did not have a mechanism for session expiration.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can use a fixed session ID to gain unauthorized access to the CMS. If they have previously gained access through another vulnerability, this session can be used to maintain access even after an administrator changes their password. This can be used to sustain access even after remediation attempts by the administrator. Brute force attacks are easier because of the lack of rate limiting on sessions.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through manipulating the "PHPSESSID" cookie in the browser. An attacker could set a specific session ID, then trick an administrator into logging in. This would then validate the attacker's fixed session.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to set the "PHPSESSID" cookie. The attacker requires a valid set of credentials to use a fixed session and gain access to the application and to conduct a session fixation attack.
