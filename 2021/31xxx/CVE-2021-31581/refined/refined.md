Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-31581:

**CVE-2021-31581**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the way the 'vi' editor is used within the restricted shell environment of Akkadian Provisioning Manager. The 'vi' editor allows execution of arbitrary commands via the `:!` escape sequence.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   The restricted shell environment does not properly prevent command execution using the `vi` editor's `:!` escape sequence.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can bypass the restricted shell and gain root-level shell access on the affected device. This enables the attacker to perform a range of malicious activities, such as installing cryptominers, keystroke loggers, or persistent shells, as well as any other type of Linux-based malware.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker needs to have access to the restricted shell of the Akkadian Provisioning Manager, which is achievable by knowing the hardcoded `hakkadianuser` credentials, as detailed in CVE-2021-31579, followed by navigating the menu system and selecting the option to edit a configuration file, which opens a `vi` editor.
    *   Once in the `vi` editor, the attacker can then use the `:!` command to escape the restricted shell and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Network access to the Akkadian Provisioning Manager.
    *   Knowledge of the hardcoded credentials (username: `hakkadianuser`, password: `hakkadianpassword`) for the restricted shell.
    *   Ability to navigate the restricted shell's menu system.

**Additional Details (beyond the CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by accessing the menu options to edit the MySQL configuration file (`/etc/my.cnf`) which opens `vi`. The attacker then uses `vi`'s `:!` command escape to execute system commands.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable because the `akkadianuser` has unrestricted `sudo` privileges without requiring a password.
*   The combination of CVE-2021-31579 (hardcoded credentials) and CVE-2021-31581 allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to gain complete root access.
*   The vendor has provided updated versions to address the vulnerabilities (Akkadian OVA appliance version 3.0 or later, Akkadian Provisioning Manager 5.0.2 or later, and Akkadian Appliance Manager 3.3.0.314-4a349e0 or later).
