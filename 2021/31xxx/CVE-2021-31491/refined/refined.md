Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-31491:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DWF files in OpenText Brava! Desktop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Write:** The insufficient validation of user-supplied data leads to a write operation that exceeds the boundaries of an allocated buffer. This is a classic memory corruption vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running the vulnerable application. This could allow for full system compromise depending on process privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File:** The primary attack vector involves the victim opening a specially crafted, malicious DWF file.
*  **Malicious Webpage**: The victim could also be exploited by visiting a malicious webpage which triggers the vulnerability when the DWF file is parsed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not need to have prior access to the system.
*  **User Interaction**: The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a malicious DWF file or visiting a malicious web page for successful exploitation.

**Additional Details**
*   The vulnerability is present in OpenText Brava! Desktop version 16.6.3.84
*   It was fixed in version 16.6.4.114.
