Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-31513

**Vulnerable Software:** OpenText Brava! Desktop Build 16.6.4.55

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of BMP files within OpenText Brava! Desktop.
- The core issue is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during BMP file parsing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds Write:** The insufficient validation of user-supplied data leads to a write operation that exceeds the boundaries of an allocated buffer. This out-of-bounds write can corrupt memory, leading to unexpected program behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By successfully exploiting this vulnerability, a remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This implies that the attacker can potentially gain complete control over the system where OpenText Brava! Desktop is running, depending on the privileges associated with the process.
- **Code Execution Context:** The arbitrary code execution occurs within the context of the current process, meaning the attacker's code runs with the same privileges as the user running the vulnerable software.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File:** An attacker can create a specially crafted, malicious BMP file designed to trigger the out-of-bounds write during parsing.
- **Malicious Page:** The user could be enticed to visit a malicious web page that contains the malicious BMP file or triggers the vulnerable parsing through other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction; the target user must either open the malicious BMP file or visit a malicious web page hosting or triggering the attack.

**Additional Details**
- Fixed in Lt2dl 1.5.17.38
- ZDI-CAN-13678
