Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31153:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `please` utility performs arbitrary file and directory existence tests due to insufficient checks within its code. This is primarily caused by the `-c`, `--check`, `-d` command line switches and the `search_path()` function. These checks utilize root privileges, leading to potential information leaks and other issues.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Arbitrary file existence testing as root.
    *   Arbitrary file opening as root with `-c`, potentially leading to OOM errors.
    *   Directory existence testing and differentiation between files and directories.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Leak:** Minimal information leak through error messages exposing line numbers in files that are checked for existence using the `-c` option.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Potential for denial of service via OOM conditions through opening and reading large files or devices (e.g., `/dev/zero`, `/dev/sda`) with `-c`.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Command-line switches `-c` or `--check` with arbitrary file paths.
    *   Execution of `please` with arbitrary file paths as arguments.
    *   Command-line switch `-d` with arbitrary file paths.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be a user with the ability to execute the `please` utility.

**Additional details:**

* The `-c` option allows for opening arbitrary files, which can lead to the program running out of memory if the file is too large, or if it's a device like `/dev/sda` or `/dev/zero`.
* The `search_path()` function allows for checking file existence, leaking whether the given path exists.
* The `-d` switch allows differentiating between files and directories.

**CVE Assignment:**

* CVE-2021-31153 is assigned to the cumulative vulnerability of all file and directory existence tests in `please`. This encompasses the findings from 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c in the report.
