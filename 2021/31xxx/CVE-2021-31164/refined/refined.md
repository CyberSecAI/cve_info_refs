- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of escaping in log statements within Apache Unomi.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CRLF log injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Attackers can inject arbitrary log entries, potentially leading to log manipulation, log poisoning, or other attacks that leverage the logging mechanism.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting CRLF characters into input that is logged by the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply input that will be logged by Apache Unomi.
