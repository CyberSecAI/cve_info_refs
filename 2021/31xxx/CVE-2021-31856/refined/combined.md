| Do we need to be concerned with `group by`?  We don't take `group by` queries from users at the moment. However, in future if our APIs do start supporting `group by` clause then probably we will need to sanitize that too. |

I wonder if we should be logging an error or if that leaves Meshery open to a potential overflow of logs.

I am not sure if logging an error that an invalid "order by" query was passed will be helpful as if for some reason the query was actually malformed then it is probably an attack. However, there could be a case when a developer may have written a malformed query while developing, so for this use case adding a debug log in here maybe helpful in debugging.

Sorry, something went wrong.

How do we make this new function compulsory for all Get() functions that invoke SQL queries?

Do we need to consider Update() and Delete() functions as receiving the sanitizeOrderInput() as well?

This function is now invoked before every `SELECT` type query where we expose a portion of the query in the API. I am not sure if can get any more stricter here as the function needs to know the "whitelisted" column names and they differ for each table.

We won't need the custom sanitization in the functions like `Update` or `Delete` as they don't use any of the SQL injection unsafe method listed here: <https://gorm.io/docs/security.html>
