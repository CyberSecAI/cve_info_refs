Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-31883:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The DHCP client application, when processing a DHCP ACK message, does not validate the length of the Vendor option(s).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119). This means the software doesn't properly check the size of the data it is reading or writing to a memory buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Denial-of-Service (DoS) conditions. The vulnerability can crash the affected system due to memory corruption, preventing it from operating normally.
*  Potential for partial information disclosure as indicated by CVSS score, however the documents does not elaborate further

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker adjacent to the target network sends a crafted DHCP ACK message to the vulnerable system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be on the same network segment as the targeted device or have the ability to send the crafted DHCP ACK messages to the device. The attacker does not need any specific authentication or user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to craft a specific DHCP ACK message that contains vendor option(s) with an invalid length.
