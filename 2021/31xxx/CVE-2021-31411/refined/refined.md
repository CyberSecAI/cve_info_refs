Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31411:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of temporary directories during the frontend build process of Vaadin applications.
*   Specifically, when extracting frontend resources from Java artifacts (.jar files), the resources were temporarily copied to the operating system's default temporary directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Temporary Directory Permissions:** The default temporary directories in \*NIX-based systems are typically writable by all users.
*   **Lack of Content Verification:** The application did not compare the contents of the extracted jar file with existing target files before overwriting them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Injection:** A local attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the extracted frontend resources while they reside in the shared temporary directory. This malicious code would then be included in the application build.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The injected malicious code could then be executed within the end user's browser as part of the application, leading to potential data breaches, unauthorized access, or other forms of compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:**  The attack requires local access to the system where the Vaadin application is being built.
*   **\*NIX Systems:**  The vulnerability is specific to \*NIX-based systems due to the default permissions of their temporary directories.
*   **Timing:** The attacker would need to be able to modify the temporary files during the build process. This would likely require monitoring the system and making a change in a specific window of opportunity.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs to have a local user account on the system where the Vaadin application is being built.
*   **File System Access:** They need to have write access to the operating system's default temporary directory.
*   **Knowledge of Build Process:** While not explicitly stated, the attacker would need some knowledge of the Vaadin build process to target the specific temporary files generated.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by implementing a check that compares the file content of the jar with the existing target before overwriting, and by using a more secure temporary directory.
*   The provided Github link shows the pull request with the fix for the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was present in Vaadin versions 14.0.3 through 14.5.2, and 15 through 19.0.4. Users are advised to upgrade to the fixed versions to mitigate the risks.
