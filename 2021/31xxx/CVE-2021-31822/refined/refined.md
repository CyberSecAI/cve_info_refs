{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-controlled input when handling an API request to the /api/tasks/{id}/raw endpoint, where a task ID from a different project than the user was attempting to access could be supplied.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper access control and input validation.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious user with access to one project could view the raw output from tasks run in other projects. The impact of this is dependent on the content of the output, but could include sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or API keys.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending a specially crafted API request to the `/api/tasks/{id}/raw` endpoint with the ID of a task from another project.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have a valid Octopus Deploy account and have access to at least one project in the system. The attacker must know the IDs of tasks running in other projects (or be able to guess them).",
