Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-31418

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper initialization of memory within the Toolgate component of Parallels Desktop. Specifically, memory is accessed before it has been initialized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Uninitialized Memory Access:** The core issue is that the Toolgate component accesses memory that has not been properly initialized. This leads to an information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit allows a local attacker to disclose sensitive information from the affected Parallels Desktop installation.
* **Potential Privilege Escalation:** The advisory mentions that the vulnerability can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and potentially execute arbitrary code in the hypervisor's context.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Local Access Required:** An attacker needs the ability to execute low-privileged code on the guest system (the virtual machine) to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Low-Privilege Code Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to run code with low privileges within the guest operating system. This implies they already have some level of access to the guest system.

**Additional Information:**
* **Affected Products:** Parallels Desktop
* **Affected Component:** Toolgate
* **Vendor:** Parallels
* **CVSS Score:** 6.5 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)
