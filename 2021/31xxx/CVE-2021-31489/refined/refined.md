**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves user interaction. Specifically, the victim must either:
    - Visit a malicious page containing a crafted DWF file.
    - Open a malicious DWF file directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious DWF file to the victim. This could be through a website, email, or other file-sharing methods. The attacker doesn't need prior access to the system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located within the parsing of DWF files.
- The issue can lead to writing beyond the bounds of an allocated memory buffer.
- The vulnerability was reported by rgod.
- It was fixed in version 16.6.4.114 of OpenText Brava! Desktop.
- The vulnerability is also identified by the ZDI identifier ZDI-CAN-12717
