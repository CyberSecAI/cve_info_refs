- **Root cause of vulnerability:** During serialization, struct padding bytes and unused enum bytes may not be initialized.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uninitialized memory is written to the output.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Sensitive information can be leaked through uninitialized memory being written to disk or sent over unsecured channels.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when serializing data with `rkyv`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special privileges or user interaction are required, and the attack can be performed over a network.
