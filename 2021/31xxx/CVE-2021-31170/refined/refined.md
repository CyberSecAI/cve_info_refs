- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free condition when handling Palette objects due to a lack of validation of the object's existence before performing operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker needs to first execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
