Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31866:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `SysController` and `MailHandlerController` of Redmine. These controllers are susceptible to timing attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Timing Attack:** The core weakness is that the time taken to process a request within these controllers varies based on the validity of the request. This timing difference can be measured by an attacker to infer information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  By measuring the response time, an attacker could potentially gain information about the system or the validity of certain credentials or parameters. This type of attack is often used to expose valid user accounts or passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network by sending carefully crafted requests to the vulnerable controllers (`SysController` and `MailHandlerController`).
*   **Timing Analysis:** The attacker monitors the response times to their requests to identify timing differences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Redmine application.
*   **Timing Measurement:** The attacker must be able to accurately measure the response times from the server.
*   **No authentication required** The vulnerability is exposed to both authenticated and unauthenticated users of the system

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided documents do not give specific information about the nature of the information disclosed but indicate that timing attacks are possible in these controllers.
*   The fix involves introducing changes within the controller logic that mitigates timing differences.
*   This vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" in severity within the context of Redmine security advisories.

This analysis goes beyond the basic description, by specifying the affected components, the nature of the attack and the type of impact.
