Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31403:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of non-constant-time comparison of CSRF tokens within the UIDL request handler in Vaadin server. This means the time taken to compare tokens varied depending on how many characters of the provided token matched the expected token.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Timing Side Channel:** The primary weakness is a timing side-channel vulnerability. An attacker can observe the time it takes for the server to reject requests with invalid CSRF tokens. This timing difference can leak information about the validity of the token, as character-by-character comparison terminates early if a mismatch occurs.
*   **Non-constant time comparison:** Using a non-constant time comparison algorithm for the CSRF tokens made it possible for an attacker to determine if the provided token was correct by the time taken to reject the request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **CSRF Token Exposure:**  An attacker can potentially guess a user's CSRF token by repeatedly sending requests with slightly modified tokens and measuring the server's response time, as longer rejection times could indicate more matching characters, thus allowing them to eventually identify valid tokens.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** By obtaining the CSRF token, the attacker can then craft malicious requests to the server on behalf of the user, potentially performing unauthorized actions without the user's explicit consent.
*   **Blind Data Submission:** The attacker can submit data on the user's behalf, although they may not be able to read the responses.
*   **Websocket Exploitation:** The attacker can potentially open websockets and listen for data published by the server for the compromised user, which might contain sensitive information based on the application logic.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Timing Attacks:**  The attack vector is primarily network-based, involving sending crafted requests to the server and measuring the response times.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Vaadin application.
*   **Timing Measurement:** The attacker needs the capability to accurately measure the time it takes for the server to respond to the crafted requests.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** The attack does not require any user interaction.
*   **No prior knowledge of a valid token**: The attacker only needs to be able to observe the timing difference for each request to be able to guess the valid token character by character.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Vaadin server versions 7.0.0 through 7.7.23 and 8.0.0 through 8.12.2.
*   The fix involves implementing constant-time comparison for all security tokens to prevent these timing attacks.
*   The vulnerability is also applicable to upload security keys and push IDs.
