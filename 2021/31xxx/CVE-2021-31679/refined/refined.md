The provided content relates to CVE-2021-31679.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper verification of user actions, specifically in the modification and deletion of user data, leading to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Reflected XSS vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **CSRF Vulnerability (Multiple Instances):**
    *   Modifying admin's password, email, phone, and head-image in `pescms/App/Team/PUT/User.php` is vulnerable to CSRF attacks because there is no verification of the operation's legality.
    *   Deleting user accounts in `pescms/App/Team/DELETE/Content.php` and `pescms/App/Team/DELETE/Field.php` can be performed by manipulating the 'id' in the URL without proper validation, making it vulnerable to CSRF.
    *   Deleting important data in various files like `pescms/App/Team/DELETE/Attachment.php`, `pescms/App/Team/DELETE/Content.php`, `pescms/App/Team/DELETE/Field.php`, `pescms/App/Team/DELETE/Model.php`, and `pescms/App/Team/DELETE/Notice.php` is possible via CSRF due to lack of verification on delete operations.
2.  **Reflected XSS:**
    *   The `pescms/App/Team/GET/Repoort.php` file is vulnerable to Reflected XSS because the values from `$_GET('begin')` and `$_GET('end')` are directly output to the page without sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **CSRF:**
    *   Attackers can modify an admin's password, email, phone number, and profile picture.
    *   Attackers can delete user accounts, including administrator accounts.
    *   Attackers can delete important information and data associated with the application.
*   **Reflected XSS:**
    *   Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser.
    *   When combined with CSRF, this can lead to more significant damage.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **CSRF:** The attacker can trick a logged-in user into unknowingly submitting a malicious request through a crafted HTML form. This is typically achieved by hosting the malicious HTML page on a site controlled by the attacker and having the victim user visit the page.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker can craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code, which is reflected back to the user's browser when the user visits the link. This can be sent through a phishing attack, for instance.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **CSRF:** The attacker needs to lure a logged-in user to access a malicious HTML page and have them click the submit button to unknowingly perform an action in the vulnerable application.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking a specially crafted malicious URL.
