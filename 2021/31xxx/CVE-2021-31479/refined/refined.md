Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-31479:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper initialization of a pointer before it's accessed during the parsing of PDF files within OpenText Brava! Desktop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uninitialized pointer: A pointer is used without being assigned a valid memory address first. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, potentially including memory corruption.
- Lack of proper input validation: The code does not adequately validate the structure of the PDF file which results in the uninitialized pointer being used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute code within the context of the currently running process. This gives the attacker the potential to take full control of the affected system.
-  The vulnerability can lead to a remote code execution (RCE).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious PDF files: An attacker could craft a specially designed PDF file to trigger the vulnerability.
- Malicious web pages: Users visiting a malicious webpage can be targeted if the webpage loads the crafted PDF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- User Interaction: The attacker needs to induce user interaction which either involves tricking the user to open a malicious PDF file or visiting a malicious web page that loads a specially crafted PDF file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in OpenText Brava! Desktop version 16.6.4.92.
- The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-21-619 with the CAN identifier CAN-12634.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2021-02-08 with a public release date of 2021-06-02.
