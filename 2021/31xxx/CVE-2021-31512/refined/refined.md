Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-31512

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing TIF files within OpenText Brava! Desktop. Specifically, it results in a read operation that goes beyond the allocated buffer.
*   **Weakness:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process running Brava! Desktop.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector involves a remote attacker. User interaction is required in the form of opening a malicious TIF file or visiting a malicious page hosting a malicious TIF file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker would need to craft a malicious TIF file designed to trigger the out-of-bounds read vulnerability. They would also need to be able to deliver this malicious file to a victim. The attacker needs no prior access to the victim machine and can trigger the vulnerability by simply getting the user to open a crafted file.
* **Affected Product:** OpenText Brava! Desktop
* **Fixed In:** Lt2dl 1.5.17.38

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in OpenText Brava! Desktop Build 16.6.4.55
*   The vulnerability was reported to OpenText on 2021-04-16, and a coordinated public release of the advisory was made on 2021-06-15.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Michael DePlante (@izobashi) of Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
*   The CVSS score is 7.8, with the vector string `AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`. This indicates a high severity vulnerability that can be triggered by local access (AV:L) with no privileges (PR:N), by a user interaction (UI:R), and results in high impact on confidentiality (C:H), integrity (I:H), and availability (A:H).
