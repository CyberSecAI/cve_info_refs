  ### 3. How We Use Cookies and Similar Technologies

  To provide you with a more convenient browsing experience, we sometimes store small data files called cookies on your computer or mobile device. Cookies are text files stored by a web server on a computer or mobile device, and their content can only be retrieved or read by the server that created them. Each cookie is unique to your web browser or mobile application. Cookies typically contain identifiers, site names, and some numbers and characters. Through cookies, websites can remember users' single or multiple visits (using session cookies) or preferences for settings such as language, font size, and other browsing preferences. This means that users do not need to reconfigure their preferences every time they visit a site. If a website does not use cookies, it will treat each visit by the user as a new visitor. For example, if you log in to a website and then go to another page, the website will not recognize you, and you will be logged out again.

  In order to provide you with more convenient and personalized services, we provide the following services through cookies and other technologies:

  (1) Analyze how you use our services. For example, we may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to understand the specific purposes for which you use our services or which web pages or services are most popular with you.

  (2) Optimize advertising. We may display products or advertising information that you may be interested in based on statistical information about the websites you visit. This statistical information does not include any of your business contact information and may be used to assess the effectiveness of advertising. Cookies, web beacons, and other technologies help us provide targeted advertising related to the enterprise you represent rather than generic advertising.

  (3) We may also use web beacon technology to compile statistics on anonymous access data. Similarly, this statistical information does not include your business contact information.

  We will not use cookies for any purpose other than those stated in this policy. You can manage or delete cookies based on your preferences using your browser or device settings, which have built-in cookie clearing functions. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to reject cookies or delete cookies as needed. However, doing so may impact the security and convenience of your use of our services, but it will not affect your normal use of other services we provide.

  ### 4. How We Entrust Processing, Share, Transfer, and Publicly Disclose Your Business Contact Information

  **4.1 Sharing**

  We will not share your business contact information with any companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Akuvox, except in the following cases:

  (1) With your explicit consent or authorization in advance;

  (4) We will only share business contact information that is necessary to provide the services you need.

  Since we collect data from you as business contact information for the purpose of business negotiations and cooperation, we may entrust authorized partners in your country to track your related business demands and send information to these partners to ensure the smooth provision of services to you. However, we will only share necessary business contact information for legal, legitimate, necessary, specific, and explicit purposes, and we will only share business contact information necessary to provide services. Our partners do not have the right to use shared business contact information for any other purpose.

  (2) In cases where it is necessary to provide your business contact information according to the requirements of laws, regulations, or mandatory administrative law enforcement or judicial requirements, we may disclose your business contact information in accordance with the types and methods of business contact information requested. Within the scope of laws and regulations, when we receive requests for disclosure of the above information, we will require the issuance of corresponding legal documents, such as subpoenas or investigation letters. We firmly believe that information requested by us should be kept as transparent as possible within the limits permitted by law.

  ### 5. How We Protect Your Business Contact Information

  **5.1 Technical and Security Measures to Protect Your Business Contact Information**

  We attach great importance to the security of business contact information and take all reasonable and feasible measures to protect your business contact information:

  Data Security Technical Measures: We will adopt security protection measures that comply with industry standards, including the establishment of reasonable system specifications and security technologies to prevent unauthorized access, use, modification, damage, or loss of your business contact information. This site uses encryption technology such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) to provide browsing services via HTTPS to ensure the security of user data during transmission. Akuvox uses encryption technology to encrypt and store users' business contact information and isolates it through isolation technology. Akuvox conducts comprehensive security control of data through information access agreements, monitoring, and auditing mechanisms. Strengthening Security Awareness: We also organize security and privacy protection training courses to enhance employees' awareness of the importance of protecting business contact information. We also require all personnel who may come into contact with your business contact information to fulfill their corresponding confidentiality obligations. Failure to fulfill these obligations may result in legal liability or suspension of cooperation with Akuvox.

  The internet is not an absolutely secure environment, and communication methods such as email, instant messaging, and social software cannot determine whether they are fully encrypted when communicating with other users. We recommend that you use complex passwords and take care to protect the security of your business contact information when using such tools. The internet environment is not 100% secure, and we will make every effort to ensure or guarantee the security of any information you send to us.

  Handling Security Incidents: To respond to risks such as business contact information leakage, damage, and loss, Akuvox has established multiple systems, clarified the classification and grading standards of security incidents and vulnerabilities, and the corresponding processing procedures. Akuvox has also established a dedicated emergency response team for security incidents, and in accordance with the requirements of security incident handling specifications, has launched security plans for different security incidents, conducted loss prevention, analysis, positioning, and formulated remedial measures, and jointly traced and cracked down on relevant departments. In the event of a business contact information security incident, we will promptly inform you in accordance with the requirements of laws and regulations: the basic situation of the security incident and possible impacts, the measures we have taken or will take, suggestions for you to take preventive measures and reduce risks, and remedies for you. We will also notify you of the relevant situation through email, letter, phone, push notification, etc. When it is difficult to notify each business contact information subject one by one, we will adopt reasonable and effective methods to issue announcements. At the same time, we will actively report the disposal of business contact information security incidents to regulatory authorities.

  If you have any questions about our protection of business contact information, you can contact us through the contact information specified at the bottom of this policy. If you find that your business contact information has been leaked, especially if your account and password have been leaked, please immediately email us at website@akuvox.com to contact us so that we can take corresponding measures.

  **5.2 Storage of Your Business Contact Information**

  User data will be stored on secure and reliable servers, and necessary physical and technical measures will be taken to ensure data security. We will establish a sound access control mechanism and record and audit all access, regularly check and update security policies to ensure that our data storage solution complies with the latest security standards.
