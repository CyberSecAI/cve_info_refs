|  | Platform: Windows 10 version 1904 |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | Impact: Arbitrary Code Execution and Privilege Escalation |
|  |  |
|  | Product: UwAmp.exe |
|  | Version: 3.0.2 |
|  |  |
|  | Summary: |
|  | A malicous user can perform arbitrary code execution and priviledge escalation on victim machine by hijacking DLLs. |
|  | DLL Hijacking vulnerability occurs when some DLLs are missing from same directory of vulnerable binary. |
|  | Crafted Malicous DLLs are used to replace missing dlls and perform malicious actions |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  | Missing DLL : shfolder.dll |
|  |  |
|  | Steps to reproduce: |
|  | 1. Use ProcMon to listen on events |
|  | 2. ProcMon shows shfolder.dll is missing from current directory |
|  | 2. Place malicious DLL naming shfolder.dll to current directory of installer |
|  | 3. Now run UwAmp.exe and installer will try to load malicous dll which leads to arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation. |
|  |  |
|  | Impact: |
|  | 1. Privilege Escalation |
|  | 2. Arbitrary Code Execution |
|  |  |
|  | Mitigation: |
|  | 1. Avoid loading DLLs from current location |
|  |  |
