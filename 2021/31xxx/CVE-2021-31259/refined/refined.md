Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31259:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a null dereference in the `gf_isom_cenc_get_default_info_internal` function within the MP4Box tool of GPAC.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- The code had a flaw where it could dereference a null pointer `seig_entry->key_info[0]`  if `seig_entry` was NULL. This would occur if the `sgdesc->group_descriptions` list was empty or if the default description index was out of bounds.

**Impact:**
- A null pointer dereference will lead to a crash of the application which may result in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a malicious MP4 file that would lead to an empty `sgdesc->group_descriptions` or an invalid `sgdesc->default_description_index`..

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted MP4 file to the vulnerable MP4Box tool.

**Additional Information:**
- The commit `3b84ffcbacf144ce35650df958432f472b6483f8` addresses the vulnerability by adding a check to ensure `seig_entry` is not NULL before accessing `key_info[0]`.
- The issue was reported and fixed on April 8, 2021.
- The commit message "fixed #1735" confirms the fix for issue #1735 where the vulnerability was described.
