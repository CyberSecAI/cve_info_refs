  "CVE-2021-31579": {
    "Root cause": "The Akkadian Provisioning Manager (PME) uses a hard-coded password for a high availability user account.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can gain access to the Akkadian PME restricted shell by using the hard-coded password. When combined with CVE-2021-31580 or CVE-2021-31581, allows an attacker to gain root-level shell access.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker needs to gain access to the PME appliance. After that the attacker can use the hardcoded credentials via ssh to get access to the restricted shell.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must have access to the PME appliance and knowledge of the hardcoded username 'hakkadianuser' as well as the password 'hakkadianpassword'."
