# OpenMPTCProuter

OpenMPTCProuter use [MultiPath TCP (MPTCP)](https://www.multipath-tcp.org/) to really aggregate multiple Internet connections and [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/).

![OpenMPTCProuter diagram](/img/openmptcprouter.svg)
*A simple diagram to describe how OpenMPTCProuter is working.*

#### Aggregation

Bonding connections to really aggregate bandwidth from up to 8 internet connections with different characteristics (Fiber, ADSL, VDSL, 4G, 5G,...)

*Provide hybrid Internet with any FAI*

#### Failover

Always up with connection and server failover

#### Security

All data between the router and the server part are encrypted by default and can be obfuscated

[openmptcprouter-vps-admin](https://github.com/Ysurac/openmptcprouter-vps-admin) Version 0.57.3 and before is vulnerable to timing attack during authentication based on ‘Basic Authentication’ mechanism.

The weakness exists in the file omr-admin.py on line 779 where the password supplied in the HTTP request is compared with the one in the configuration. The method uses python string comparison ‘==’ method which internally compares the string one character at a time without checking the string length returning false only when a character differs. More analysis has already been done and can be found [here](https://sqreen.github.io/DevelopersSecurityBestPractices/timing-attack/python)

Let’s look at the code snippet responsible for this weakness,

![]()

I reported the issue to the author <https://github.com/Ysurac> and a fix was issue within hours the same day. After fix, the code snippet looks like the below,

![]()

([Link](https://github.com/Ysurac/openmptcprouter-vps-admin/commit/a01cbc8c3d3b8bb7720bf3ff234671b4c0e1859c#diff-b89ee68e63302a732d4bde35eb04a205b06f1611147e139642356f173195ab80) to the commit history)

Basically, the author used python secrets module’s “compare\_digest()” method to securely compare strings. Official document for this module can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html)

This issue has been reported to MITRE and they assigned [CVE-2021–31245](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-31245) to it.

> Takeaways,
>
> Although timing attacks are difficult, they are not impossible. So one must account for these possibilities when implementing functions such as authentication/authorization or anything that has a security impact.
