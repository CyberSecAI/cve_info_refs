### @nmeum **[nmeum](/nmeum)** commented [Feb 8, 2021](#issue-803576609)

### Contribution description

While the for-loop condition does contain a bounds check, the pointer is independently increment in the for-loop body. This increment therefore requires a separate bounds check. Otherwise, the parsing loop may access data outside the given buffer boundaries.

### Testing procedure

Sample application code:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <clif.h>

static uint8_t buf[] = { 59, 196, 198, 196, 196, 196, 196, 196, 196, 61 };

int main(void)
{
        char *input = (char *)&buf[0];
	clif_attr_t attr;
	clif_get_attr(input, sizeof(buf), &attr);
	return 0;
}
```

Minimal `Makefile`:

```
APPLICATION = clif

BOARD = native

USEMODULE += clif

RIOTBASE ?= $(CURDIR)/../..
include $(RIOTBASE)/Makefile.include
```

Invoke as:

```
$ make -C examples/clif all-asan
$ make -C examples/clif term

If it gets to this condition, it would be a malformed attribute right? (e.g. `foo=`)

Right, but what about `foo="`? That doesn't seem to return `CLIF_NOT_FOUND` either at the moment or am I missing something here?

Yeah, we should check for that, and also a possible `foo="ba` I guess, and return `CLIF_NOT_FOUND`

Ok, maybe it makes sense to implement this separately? The changes I propose here handle `foo=` in the same way as `foo="` is handled presently.

Done. Keep in mind though that the tests are not run with ASAN enabled. So even if this bug would be reintroduced they would not necessarily detect it.
