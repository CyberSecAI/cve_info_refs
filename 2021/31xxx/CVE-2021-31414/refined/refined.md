Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31414:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper access control within the RPM Specfile support extension for VSCode. A crafted workspace configuration allows the execution of arbitrary binaries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):** The extension does not properly restrict the execution of commands specified in the workspace configuration. This lack of control allows an attacker to specify arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine when they open a malicious workspace folder containing a crafted configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious actor creates a specially crafted workspace configuration file for VSCode.
- The victim opens this workspace within VSCode using the vulnerable extension.
- The malicious configuration triggers the execution of arbitrary commands specified within it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a workspace configuration file that will be opened by a victim using the vulnerable VSCode extension.
- The attacker doesn't necessarily need to be on the same network as the victim, just needs to be able to get the crafted workspace to the victim.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.3.2 of the extension.
- The commit diff provided adds scopes to the configuration points, suggesting this was part of the fix.
- The vulnerable extension is "RPM Specfile support in VSCode" by Laurent Tr√©guier.
