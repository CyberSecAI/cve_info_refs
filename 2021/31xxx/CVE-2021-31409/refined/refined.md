Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31409:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `EmailValidator` class in the Vaadin 7 compatibility module (specifically, `com.vaadin.v7.data.validator.EmailValidator`) uses a regular expression to validate email addresses.
- This regular expression is vulnerable to exponential backtracking, which can cause excessive resource consumption when processing specially crafted, malicious email addresses.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **ReDoS (Regular expression Denial of Service):** The vulnerable regular expression leads to exponential backtracking, which means that the time it takes to process certain input strings can increase exponentially with the length of the string. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service.
- **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:**  The excessive time spent in the regex matching operation consumes server resources (CPU, threads), making the application unresponsive.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the server to become unresponsive by repeatedly submitting malicious email addresses, leading to thread exhaustion or other resource depletion.
- **Application Unavailability:** Legitimate users will be unable to use the application while the server is overloaded by the attack.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** Attackers send malicious email addresses through any field that uses `EmailValidator` on the server side (e.g., login forms, signup forms).
- **Input manipulation:** An attacker needs to craft an email string that exploits the vulnerable regex pattern causing excessive processing time.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to submit data to the server, i.e. be able to send HTTP requests to a web application that uses the affected Vaadin component.
- **No authentication:** The attacker does not require prior authentication, since the vulnerable component can be triggered via publicly available inputs.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Vaadin 8 compatibility server versions 8.0.0 through 8.12.4.
- The fix is available in version 8.13.0 and later.
- The vulnerability was reported by Stefan Penndorf.
