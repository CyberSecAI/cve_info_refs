GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC RF185C, RF186C/CI, and RF188C/CI are communication modules for direct connection of
SIMATIC identiﬁcation systems to PROFINET IO/Ethernet and OPC UA.

SIMATIC RF300R is a compact RFID reader for use with Proﬁnet and Ethernet

SIMATIC RF600 Readers are used for the contactless identiﬁcation of every kind of object, e.g. transport
containers, pallets, production goods, or it can be generally used for recording goods in bulk.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-31340

Affected devices do not properly handle large numbers of incoming connections. An attacker may
leverage this to cause a Denial-of-Service situation.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
