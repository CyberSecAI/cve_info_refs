  "CVE-2021-31590": {
    "Description": "PwnDoc through 2021-04-22 has incorrect JSON Webtoken handling, leading to incorrect access control. With a valid JSON Webtoken that is used for authentication and authorization, a user can keep his admin privileges even if he is downgraded to the \"user\" privilege. Even after a user's account is deleted, the user can still access the administration panel (and add or delete users) and has complete access to the system.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The backend only verifies the JWT itself but misses essential checks against the database to verify that the stored data in the JWT is still applicable.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Incorrect access control due to improper JWT handling",
      "Backend does not verify JWT claims against the database after token generation",
      "Use of hardcoded JWT secrets",
      "Lack of proper session management"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with a valid JWT can maintain admin privileges even after being downgraded to a regular user or after their account is deleted. This allows an attacker to continue accessing the administration panel, add or delete users, and have complete access to the system, leading to complete compromise.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "Network access to the application."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Valid JWT for a user of the application.",
	    "Ability to access and make requests to the backend."
    ],
    "Additional Information": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited even after a user's account is deleted or their privileges are revoked.",
      "The project used hard-coded JWT secrets, which made the generated JWTs remain valid even after software redeployments.",
      "A fix was proposed in pull request #128, which addresses the access control issues.",
       "A related pull request #74, was submitted to automatically generate a random JWT secret and TLS certificates.",
        "The issue was resolved with the implementation of refresh tokens and short-lived (15min) JWTs in v0.4.0."
