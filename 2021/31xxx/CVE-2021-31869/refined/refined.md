Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-31869:

**CVE-2021-31869: Pimcore AdminBundle 'specificID' SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `Pimcore/Bundles/AdminBundle/Helper/GridHelperService.php` file where the `specificID` parameter from user input is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization. This allows for arbitrary SQL injection.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** SQL Injection (CWE-89) due to improper handling of user-supplied parameters in SQL queries. Specifically, the `specificId` parameter is directly included in the SQL query string.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to extract data from the database by manipulating the SQL query to return specific information. The attacker can programmatically test characters and monitor the response to extract database content. 
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the `/admin/object/grid-proxy` endpoint. An attacker can manipulate the `specificId` parameter within the request to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have access to send requests to the `/admin/object/grid-proxy` endpoint, and be able to manipulate the request parameters. It is implied that the attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided text includes details on how to construct a SQL injection payload using boolean based blind SQL injection, demonstrating how to cause different server responses based on the injected query, which helps with data extraction.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is by updating to a patched version of Pimcore, specifically version v6.9.4.
