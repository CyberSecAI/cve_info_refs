Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31555:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The OAuth extension for MediaWiki did not properly validate the length of the `oarc_version` field in the `oauth_registered_consumer` database table. This field is defined as `varbinary(32)`, which allows for up to 32 characters, but the application did not enforce this limit.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation on the `oarc_version` field. The code only validated the format using a regular expression, but not its length.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially insert data longer than 32 characters into the `oarc_version` field, which could cause issues with database operations, data integrity, or potentially lead to other vulnerabilities, especially when strict mode is enabled in MariaDB/MySQL. It is also mentioned this can block strict mode, but not why.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by registering an OAuth consumer with an `oarc_version` value exceeding 32 characters.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker would need to be able to register an OAuth consumer. This likely requires an account on the affected MediaWiki instance and the ability to access the OAuth registration functionality.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
*   The fix involved adding length validation to the `oarc_version` field during OAuth consumer registration. This was implemented by using the existing regex validation and not relying on database length restrictions.
*   The vulnerability was present in multiple branches (`master`, `REL1_31`, `REL1_35`) of the `mediawiki/extensions/OAuth` repository, and fixes were applied to all.
*   The issue was initially flagged as a blocker for enabling strict mode in MariaDB/MySQL.
*   The fix was merged and included in MediaWiki version 1.36.0-wmf.35.
*   The fix was released as a security patch in MediaWiki versions 1.31.13/1.35.2
