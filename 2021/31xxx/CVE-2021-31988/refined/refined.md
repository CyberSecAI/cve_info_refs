- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of the "subject" parameter in the HTTP request to the `/axis-cgi/smtptest.cgi` endpoint when testing new SMTP recipients.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CRLF injection vulnerability, allowing inclusion of arbitrary SMTP headers in the test email.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary SMTP headers into the generated test email. This could potentially be used for malicious purposes, such as spoofing emails or other SMTP based attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered through a crafted HTTP request to the `/axis-cgi/smtptest.cgi` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: 
    - Network access to the Axis device.
    - Administrator-level access to the Axis device OR the ability to deceive a user with administrator-level access into visiting a specifically crafted webpage while logged in.
    - Some level of technical skill and motivation.
