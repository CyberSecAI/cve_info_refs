Affected Axis products & solutions

CVE-2021-31988

  Axis devices with AXIS OS 5.51 or later

Overview

An external research team has found a flaw in the SMTP test functionality
of the built-in event system in Axis devices. The vulnerability was
discovered by Andrea Palanca from Nozomi Networks Inc.

CVE-2021-31988

The “subject” parameter of the HTTP request to the endpoint “/axis-
cgi/smtptest.cgi”, which is sent from the browser when the “Test” button of
the “New recipient” tab is clicked to verify the network configuration of a
newly-inserted recipient, resulted improperly validated by the server- side
code, such that it was possible to add the Carriage Return and Line Feed
(CRLF) control characters and include arbitrary SMTP headers in the
generated test email.

Risk assessment

A potential adversary needs to have network access and administrator level
access to the Axis device to exploit the vulnerability or needs to deceive
a victim with administrator level access into visiting a specifically
crafted webpage while logged in. He/she also requires some level of
technical skills and motivation.

Axis will release patches on the following AXIS OS tracks:

  Active track 10.7
  2016 LTS track 6.50.5.5
  2018 LTS track 8.40.4.3
