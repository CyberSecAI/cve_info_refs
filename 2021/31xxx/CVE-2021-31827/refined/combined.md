## Encryption Key Rotation Manager

The key rotation manager enables you to refresh the organization's passphrase (and the key derived from it) for your *at-rest* data (organization filestore). Use the key management interface to deploy a rotation schedule, launch the key rotation process directly, or both. When file re-encryption work completes using the new key, MOVEit Transfer notifies you by email.

Using this robust key management dashboard, you can:

* View history of organization-wide encryption key rotation.
* Get a helpful time-to-complete estimate.
* Launch re-encryption work right now, in off-hours, or as appropriate (override with *pause* and *resume*)
* Pause and restart the conversion process.
* Get reminders on paused or pending rotations.
* Get completion summary, alerts, and reports on completed rotations.

| View Key History (freshness) |  |
| --- | --- |
| Get Time Needed to Re-encrypt |  |
| Pause and Resume |  |
| Schedule Key Rotation |  |
| Scheduled Reminder Emails |  |

## MOVEit Client Enabled with MFA

MOVEit Client gives users private access to a uniquely-generated verification code (made available by email or mobile app). This additional verification step ensures user sign-on is genuine.

Users can manage MFA settings through the WebUI **My Account** page.

## Logging Performance Improvements

We improved diagnostic logging performance so users with heavier system loads can enable higher debug levels, which allows you to capture robust diagnostic information when you’re working with our technical support team. The performance improvements include a control to limit how frequently diagnostic information is written to the log files. By default, this control is set to every 60 seconds. This can be adjusted if needed.

## Custom Branding for Email Notifications

Include site, team, or enterprise logo designs in email notifications. Site branding controls are more intuitive.

![](52766.png)

The **SETTINGS > Appearance - Brand** page features intuitive controls and a new preview mode. You can apply defaults at the global (SysAdmin) and specific designs for MOVEit Transfer organizations (OrgAdmin level).

## Critical System Alerts Email

Configure distinct email target/recipient for cases where MOVEit Transfer detects high-severity, low-frequency events. For example, email recipients could be an operations engineer, an IT group's 'on-call' list, or other responsible individuals in accordance with site-reliability notification and escalation schedules.

# Upgrading

Upgrading to the latest version of MOVEit Transfer ensures that you have access to the latest features, fixes, security updates, and usability improvements.

If you have a support subscription, upgrades are free. For licensing information, you can [read this MOVEit License FAQ](https://community.progress.com/s/article/MOVEit-License-FAQ).

## Get the Installer and Activation Code

To get a MOVEit installer package:

1. **Log in to the** [Progress Customer and Community portal](https://community.ipswitch.com/s/) and select **Product Downloads**.
2. **Download the product package**.

   When you get your MOVEit product package from your Progress Community page, the activation code is embedded in the download file and is automatically applied during installation.

   The activation code is also stored in your Progress Community product page for reference.
3. **Before you run the upgrade installer**.
   * Review Upgrade Guidelines. They identify useful tips and guidelines for existing MOVEit Transfer or MOVEit DMZ users.
   * It is a good idea to copy and save your current product serial number. This [Progress knowledge base article](https://community.progress.com/s/article/How-do-I-locate-my-current-MOVEit-Transfer-DMZ-license-file-or-serial-number) explains how to find it.

## Upgrade Paths

MOVEit Transfer 2021 supports "direct upgrade" (upgrade by way of running the MOVEit Transfer installer) for existing MOVEit Transfer 2019 (11.0.0) and newer.

Use the Upgrade Path table to find out how you can move earlier or legacy versions to MOVEit Transfer 2021.

| Your Older MOVEit Transfer Version | Upgrade Path |
| --- | --- |
| MOVEit Transfer 2019 (11.0.0) or newer | Use Upgrade mode in MOVEit installer:   * Read the Upgrade Guidelines. * Sign in and download the upgrade installer from the [Progress Customer and Community portal](https://community.ipswitch.com/s/). |
| MOVEit Transfer 2018 PLUS SP2 (10.2) and older | If you are running a version that is [out of date](https://community.progress.com/s/life-cycle-file-transfer) or close to being out of date, you can:   * Upgrade to a supported version such as 2019 (running the 2019 installer in upgrade mode), and then... * Use the latest installer to upgrade 2019 to 2021. Check the [Product Lifecycle page](https://community.progress.com/s/life-cycle-file-transfer) --upgrade to the latest version of MOVEit Transfer if your product version is close or past its End of Life (EoL) or sunset milestones. |

## Upgrade Considerations

### Logs Directory for Web Farm Upgrade

When you upgrade a MOVEit Transfer Server node, ensure that the local logs directory defined in the Web Farm install configuration for all nodes already exists (or create one on each node). If the installer does not find this local logs directory, it will return a failure message and halt during the Web Farm scale-out process.

### MySQL Database Deployments

When you run the MOVEit Transfer installer in an upgrade scenario on a MOVEit Transfer deployment using MySQL, the installer upgrades existing MySQL 5.7 servers to MySQL 8.x.

### Any custom schema, tables, and fields (if applicable) must be backed up

It is best practice to backup any customizations before you run the MOVEit Transfer installer. MOVEit Transfer database schema customizations are not supported. If you change the name or add schema, indexes, or tables, the MOVEit Installer will not expect these manual changes and attempt to revert them.

### Reset tamper check for logs

If you have logs that include data from before and after a software upgrade, tamper check verification shows false positive tamper errors when verifying the logs.

To prevent this situation, do the following when upgrading MOVEit DMZ software to MOVEit Transfer 2017 (and later).

1. Before you upgrade, manually start the MOVEit DMZ Log Tamper Check program from the Start menu.
2. Immediately after you upgrade:
   * Sign-on as System Administrator. Click SETTINGS.
   * In the System section, Tamper Detection row, click Reset All Orgs.
3. Click Reset Tamper Detection Data.

### Upgrading to a release with Secure Folder Sharing (a post upgrade task is necessary)

If you upgrade your MOVEit Transfer installation with a version that enables Secure Folder Sharing, this feature set will be initially set to *off*. After the upgrade, as sysadmin user, you can apply the Secure Folder Sharing feature set selectively in [Org Profile Settings](https://docs.ipswitch.com/MOVEit/Transfer2018SP2/Help/admin/en/34203.htm "Org Profile Settings"). As sysadmin, you can apply these settings on an org-by-org basis.

Enable org UI Security Settings to Allow Secure Folder Sharing Feature Set (needed for upgrade installations)

**[Learn more...](https://docs.ipswitch.com/MOVEit/Transfer2020/Help/admin/en/34203.htm "Org Profile Settings")**

# System Requirements

MOVEit Transfer requires certain software and hardware to ensure correct operation.

## MOVEit Transfer Server Requirements

These requirements apply to the supporting environment and operating system where you install MOVEit Transfer server.

Before you attempt to install MOVEit Transfer server, ensure your Windows server has the latest service packs and required updates installed.

### Hardware Requirements

#### Minimum server requirements

* Four-core server-class CPU (For example: Intel Xeon 4-core 2+GHz)
* 8 GB RAM
* 250 GB or larger free disk space, depending on workload
* Gigabit Ethernet (GigE) Interface.

#### Typical server requirements

* Eight-core CPU.
* 16 GB RAM.
* Hard drive capacity of 1TB (SAS) is common.
* Free disk space should be sized based on the system log, task logs, and the expected number of concurrent active users and transfers.
* Using SSD or other high-performance disk will improve performance.
* GigE or better network interface card.

**Note:** MOVEit Transfer requires a dedicated server machine or hypervisor. Do not install MOVEit Transfer on a machine that has other applications installed.

### Software Requirements

MOVEit Transfer server requires the following software.

#### Supported Operating Systems for MOVEit Transfer

* Windows Server 2019
* Windows Server 2016

#### .NET Framework

MOVEit Transfer requires .NET 4.7.2. If the server does not have Internet access, you must install .NET by other means before you run the MOVEit Transfer installation program.

Windows Server 2019 comes with .NET 4.7.2.

### Supported Databases

MOVEit Transfer requires one of the following database platforms:.

* MySQL 8 (included in the MOVEit Transfer installation)
* Azure SQL Database
* Microsoft SQL Server 2019 Enterprise/Standard
* Microsoft SQL Server 2017 Enterprise/Standard
* Microsoft SQL Server 2016 Enterprise/Standard
* Earlier versions (not supported)

It is best to run the MOVEit Transfer Server and the database it connects to in the same time zone. Otherwise, security features like multi-factor authentication for sign-on as well as secure connection protocols used between the services will not function.

You can create an Azure SQL database using the [Azure Management Portal](http://portal.azure.com). See the upgrade and migration section for instructions on how to migrate your current database to Azure SQL.

### Compatible Third-Party AV/DLP Engines

# Known Issues

This section outlines known issues and typical workarounds for MOVEit Transfer.

| ID | Category | Known Issue in MOVEit Transfer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 365955 | Installer | After you upgrade a MOVEit Transfer server to 2020 that leverages the legacy mobile server, if you subsequently uninstall only MOVEit Transfer, the next time you run the installer the **Modify** option displays but no real modify-install scenario exists. You will not be able to complete the MOVEit Transfer install process.  **Workaround:**  To run the installer successfully, you will need to uninstall the deprecated MOVEit Mobile Server manually. Then you can re-run the MOVEit Transfer Installer. |
| UREP-5247 | Central Agent, DMZ Agent | The Analytics Agent cannot connect to the MOVEit Transfer or MOVEit Automation 2019.1 with MySQL 8.    To resolve this issue, contact Technical Support to receive a hotfix. |
| 31190 | REST API | Some virtual folder operations do not extend to the REST API.  **Workaround:**  For full parity, use the WebUI or MOVEit Automation. |
| 35331 | Key Rotation | If disk capacity is less than the largest file in your filestore and you run key rotation, your key rotation process will fail to convert that file. |
| 22448 | Key Rotation | Key rotation functionality does not extend directly to environments that use Azure Blob Service for their filestore.  **Workaround:**  Azure Storage has its own encryption scheme and key management infrastructure. |
