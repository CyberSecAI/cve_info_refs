Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31322:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `LOTGradient::populate` function of the rlottie library, which is a custom fork used by Telegram.
- The issue occurs because the code does not verify the number of color points in an animated sticker before accessing heap memory, resulting in out-of-bounds read access.
- Specifically, the number of color points is read from the animated sticker and used in a loop, without checking if it exceeds the actual number of points allocated in memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Heap out-of-bounds read:** The code reads data from heap memory beyond the allocated buffer.
- **Integer overflow leading to heap out-of-bounds read:** While not explicitly stated, the provided analysis of `VGradientCache::generateGradientColorTable`  suggests an integer overflow could lead to OOB read.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- A remote attacker can potentially access heap memory out-of-bounds on a victim's device.
- This could lead to crashes or potentially be leveraged for further exploitation, such as arbitrary code execution, depending on the context and the specific memory layout.
- A denial-of-service can occur, if a null pointer dereference occurs after an out-of-bounds read.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is through malicious animated stickers sent via Telegram.
-  The attacker crafts a specially designed animated sticker containing a manipulated number of color points which, when parsed, triggers the out-of-bounds access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send an arbitrary animated sticker to a victim.
- Initially, the vulnerability could be triggered through secret chats, as the filtering of malicious stickers in normal chats was not in place initially.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerability and how to create a malicious sticker which can trigger it.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was present in Telegram versions prior to 6.2.0 (1984).
- Telegram patched the vulnerability in version 6.2.0 (1984)
- Telegram implemented additional checks (verifying stickers against sticker sets) to prevent exploitation via malicious stickers.
- The vulnerability affected Android, iOS and macOS Telegram apps.
- The blog post mentions finding 13 vulnerabilities in total.
