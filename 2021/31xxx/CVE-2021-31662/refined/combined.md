### @nmeum **[nmeum](/nmeum)** commented [Feb 4, 2021](#issue-801390822)

### Contribution description

Before attempting to access the `://` part of the URI it is necessary to check that the URI is long enough to actually contain this string and data following it. Otherwise, a read outside the bounds of the provided buffer is performed if the buffer is too small.

### Testing procedure

Application code:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <uri_parser.h>

#define BUFFER_SIZE 5

static char buf[] = { 112, 80, 58, 47, 47, };

int main(void)
{
    size_t len = sizeof(buf);
    uri_parser_result_t result;

    uri_parser_process(&result, buf, len);
    return 0;
}
```

Makefile:

```
APPLICATION = uri
DEVELHELP = 1

BOARD = native

USEMODULE += uri_parser

RIOTBASE ?= $(CURDIR)/../..
include $(RIOTBASE)/Makefile.include
```

Run:

```
$ make -C examples/uri all-asan
$ make -C examples/uri term

Looks good as is. I think we need another check after consuming the scheme whether there is still space in buffer to consume (similar to here: <https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/15929/files#diff-05fd96efad40b0211dd1f6c15d061bc4c810f3b9f0c18eb5d33b054413aa6d75R235>). But we can do that in the other PR. I'll just rebase my PR onto your's once we merged it.

Sorry, something went wrong.
