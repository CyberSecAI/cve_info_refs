## Analysis of CVE-2021-31162

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-31162:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a double free error in the `Vec::from_iter` function within the Rust standard library. This occurs specifically when an element's `drop` function panics during the iteration process, because `drop_in_place()` is called before pointer invalidation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double Free:** The primary vulnerability is a double-free condition. When an element being moved into a `Vec` panics during its drop, the pointer to the element is not invalidated immediately. If the element is dropped again due to the panic handling, a double-free will occur. This is a memory corruption vulnerability.
- **Panic Safety Issue:** The vulnerability arises from how `Vec::from_iter` handles panics during the element dropping process, leading to unsafe behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** A double free can lead to memory corruption, which can be exploited to crash a program or potentially allow arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Triggering the double free can lead to a program crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by calling `Vec::from_iter` with an iterator that contains an element that panics when dropped. This could occur in any code path that uses `Vec::from_iter` with an iterator containing a type with a `Drop` implentation that could panic.
- The attack vector is considered network based, as the vulnerability could potentially be triggered remotely by providing carefully crafted input data to a Rust program, although this is not discussed in the provided content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to control the input data to the function `Vec::from_iter` in order to trigger the panic of element's `drop`.
- The attacker does not need any specific privileges or user interaction to trigger this.

**Additional Technical Details and Context:**
- The vulnerable code resides in the `rust/library/alloc/src/vec/source_iter_marker.rs` and `rust/library/alloc/src/vec/into_iter.rs` files in Rust's standard library.
- The vulnerability was present in Rust versions before 1.53.0.
- The fix for this vulnerability involves correcting the `drop_remaining` function in `Vec::IntoIter`, so that it properly invalidates pointers after dropping elements during panic, preventing a double free.
- The vulnerability is also related to a [CVE-2020-36323](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9v8g-q8xx-7374) as both were resolved in the same timeframe. This CVE deals with an optimization for joining strings which could expose uninitialized memory if a string's length is modified after the length check.
- The fix was backported to the beta branch of Rust, so it was addressed in version 1.52.0.
- Patches and fixes are visible in the following Rust repository pull requests:
    - [rust-lang/rust#83629](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83629)
    - [rust-lang/rust#84603](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/84603)
-  A proof of concept (PoC) is provided, demonstrating a program that triggers the double-free using a custom enum that panics on drop. This PoC shows the vulnerability exists in `rustc 1.51.0` as well as previous versions.

**Summary of provided content**
- Multiple sources state that the vulnerability is related to Rust standard library code used by  `Vec::from_iter` .
- Fixes were released in rust 1.52 and rust 1.53.
- Patches and backports were applied in multiple branches and distribution packages.
- Provides references to the fix and a proof of concept.
