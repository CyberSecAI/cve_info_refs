# Security Advisory for Arlo Q Plus SSH Use of Hard-coded Credentials Allowing Privilege Escalation

#### This article applies to:

[VMC3040S](https://www.arlo.com/en-us/support/products/arlo-q-plus.html)

Arlo is aware of a security vulnerability in the Arlo Q Plus device. This is caused by a security misconfiguration that allowed attackers with physical access to the device to escalate privileges. This vulnerability was promptly resolved by an automatic firmware update.

This was not a security breach and no videos or personal information were accessed as a result of this vulnerability. As the cybersecurity landscape continually and rapidly evolves, Arlo remains committed and on the forefront of collaborating with security researchers like Bugcrowd and Trend Micro to proactively identify opportunities to further enhance the security of Arlo’s platform.

**Security Misconfiguration**

The specific flaw exists within the SSH service. An attacker with physical access to the camera can boot into a special operation mode where hard-coded credentials are accepted for SSH authentication and can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges to root.

**This vulnerability affects the following products:**

• VMC3040S

**The following firmware update was released by Arlo to resolve this vulnerability:**

VMC3040S: 1.9.0.8\_199\_3707910

**Note:** For all Arlo products, firmware updates are sent to your devices automatically. You do not need to manually update your firmware

We appreciate and value having security concerns brought to our attention. Arlo constantly monitors for both known and unknown threats. Being proactive rather than reactive to emerging security issues is fundamental for product support at Arlo.
