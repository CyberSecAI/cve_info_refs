The content relates to CVE-2021-31746.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Pluck CMS module and theme installers are vulnerable to directory traversal (zip slip). This occurs because the application does not properly sanitize the filenames contained within the uploaded zip archives before extracting them, allowing an attacker to specify paths outside of the intended extraction directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory Traversal (Zip Slip)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) under the privileges of the user running the webserver application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Uploading a malicious zip archive via the Pluck admin panel's module or theme installer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An authenticated user with access to the Pluck CMS admin panel (password is required for exploitation).
- Ability to upload zip files containing malicious paths.
