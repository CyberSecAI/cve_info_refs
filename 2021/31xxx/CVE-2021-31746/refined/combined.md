### **[naiagoesawoo](/naiagoesawoo)** commented [Apr 21, 2021](#issue-863429744)

| **Issue Summary** Pluck's module and theme installers are vulnerable to directory traversal (via zip slip).  **Detailed Description** It is possible to upload a malicious zip file in order to traverse directories outside of the intended environment, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution which will run with the permissions of the user assigned to the webserver.  **Reproduction Steps**   1. Using the [evilarc tool](https://github.com/ptoomey3/evilarc), create a zip archive containing a PHP file with a depth of 2 `(python evilarch.py shell.php -d 2 -f wolf.zip)` 2. Visit `<pluck_domain>/admin.php?action=themeinstall` and upload the malicious `wolf.zip` you created. 3. Visit `<pluck_domain>/shell.php` and you now have a PHP shell.   **Impact** This vulnerability makes remote code execution under the privileges of the user running the webserver application possible. |
