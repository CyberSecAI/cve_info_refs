SSA-535380: Command Injection Vulnerability in Siveillance OIS
Affecting Several Building Management Systems

2021-09-14
Publication Date:
2021-09-14
Last Update:
Current Version:
V1.0
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 10.0

SUMMARY

The Siveillance Open Interface Services (OIS) application used for integration of different subsystems to
several Siemens building management systems contains a command injection vulnerability that could
allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute code on the affected system with root privileges.

Siemens has released patches and updates for Siveillance OIS to apply to the products that incorporate
the OIS service, and recommends to update to the latest versions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Ensure that the systems where Siveillance OIS is installed are only accessible by trusted personnel

• Restrict access to the affected systems, especially to port 443/tcp, to trusted IP addresses only

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Desigo CC is the integrated building management platform for managing high-performing buildings. With
its open design, it has been developed to create comfortable, safe and efﬁcient facilities. It is easily
scalable from simple single-discipline systems to fully integrated buildings.

Desigo CC Compact extends the portfolio with a tailored solution for small and medium-sized buildings.

GMA-Manager allows for functionally combining different safety and security systems such as ﬁre
detection systems and video surveillance on a single common platform.

Operation Scheduler is a tool that enables security operators to intelligently perform routine tasks. It can
be used to schedule maintenance tasks.

Siveillance Control is a Physical Security Information Management system (PSIM) that seamlessly
consolidates a variety of safety and security systems, such as access control, intrusion detection, and
video surveillance, all on one common platform.

Siveillance Control Pro is a command and control solution, speciﬁcally designed to support security
management at critical infrastructure sites such as ports, airports, oil and gas power generation and
distribution, chemical and pharma industries, heavy industries and campus environments.

Siveillance Open Interface Services (OIS) is an interface and integration platform for the integration of
subsystems into management stations.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-31891

The affected application incorrectly neutralizes special elements in a speciﬁc HTTP GET request
which could lead to command injection.

An unauthenticated remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the
system with root privileges.
