Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31546:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The AbuseFilter extension in MediaWiki was logging suppressed page deletions, making them visible to users who did not have the necessary permissions to view suppressed content. This occurred because the suppression action was not properly excluded from AbuseFilter's logging mechanisms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Information Leakage:** Suppressed content, which is intended to be hidden from most users, was being logged and made visible in the AbuseFilter logs. This exposed sensitive information to unintended parties.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privacy Violation:**  Users with access to AbuseFilter logs could view the details of suppressed content, potentially including personally identifiable information or other sensitive data that was meant to be hidden.
*   **Circumvention of Suppression:** The vulnerability effectively nullified the purpose of suppression, which is to ensure that specific content is hidden from general view.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Access to AbuseFilter logs:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by having access to the AbuseFilter logs interface. This would typically require having some level of administrative or privileged access on a MediaWiki instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have access to the AbuseFilter logs on a MediaWiki instance. This usually requires a level of permissions such as being an admin, or having access to special pages/interfaces.

**Technical Details:**
The fix involved modifying the AbuseFilter extension to check for a `$suppress` flag during the `ArticleDelete` hook. When a deletion is suppressed (meaning it should not be publicly visible), the AbuseFilter will not attempt to log or filter the action. This was implemented by:
1.  Passing a `$suppress` parameter to the `ArticleDelete` hook.
2.  Modifying AbuseFilter to skip filtering if `$suppress` is true.
The patches were applied to multiple branches, including `master`, `REL1_31`, and `REL1_35` of the MediaWiki AbuseFilter extension.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was initially reported on the beta labs instance of Wikimedia Commons and was then addressed with the patches.
*   Several other AbuseFilter-related security vulnerabilities were also fixed around the same time, suggesting a broader security review of the extension.
* The fix was deployed to production, and later backported.
