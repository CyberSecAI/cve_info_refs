{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-31609",
    "description": "The Bluetooth Classic implementation in Silicon Labs iWRAP 6.3.0 and earlier does not properly handle the reception of an oversized LMP packet greater than 17 bytes, allowing attackers in radio range to trigger a crash in WT32i via a crafted LMP packet.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper handling of oversized LMP packets, specifically when the length exceeds 17 bytes, in the Bluetooth Classic implementation of Silicon Labs iWRAP.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a firmware crash on the affected device. This can result in a denial of service (DoS) condition, requiring a device restart to restore normal operation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Over-the-air Bluetooth communication",
      "Sending a crafted LMP packet with a payload greater than 17 bytes."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth radio range of the target device and have the capability to send crafted LMP packets. No prior pairing or authentication is needed."
