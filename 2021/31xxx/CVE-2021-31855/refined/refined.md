Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-31855:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how KMail handles the deletion of attachments from decrypted encrypted messages stored on a remote server (e.g., IMAP). When an attachment is deleted, KMail incorrectly uploads the decrypted content of the message back to the remote server, instead of just removing the attachment reference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** The core vulnerability is the unintended disclosure of the decrypted message content to the remote server. This occurs because the deletion process involves updating the server-side representation of the message with the decrypted content.
-   **Improper Handling of Decrypted Data:** KMail fails to properly handle the decrypted content during attachment deletion. The decrypted data should not be re-uploaded to the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Confidentiality Breach:** If an attacker gains access to the email server, they can read the decrypted content of messages that were manipulated. This includes messages that were originally encrypted for privacy.
-   **User Deception:** An attacker could craft a message to trick a user into decrypting the message and then deleting an attachment, which would unknowingly cause the decrypted content to be sent back to the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Crafted Email Message:** An attacker sends a specially crafted encrypted email to a victim.
-   **Attachment Deletion:** The victim decrypts the message and then deletes an attachment.
-   **Server Access:** An attacker gains access to the email server where the modified message is uploaded.
-   **Data Retrieval:** The attacker retrieves and reads the decrypted content of the message from the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Email Sending Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the victim.
-   **Email Server Access:** The attacker must have access to the email server where the victim's messages are stored.
-   **Limited User Interaction:** The attacker needs the user to decrypt a specific message and then delete an attachment. This could be achieved via social engineering.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is located in `ViewerPrivate::deleteAttachment` function, in the `messageviewer/src/viewer/viewer_p.cpp` file.
*   The fix involves changing the way the message is modified before sending it back to server (identified by the commit  `3b5b171e91ce78b966c98b1292a1bcbc8d984799`).
*   The issue was fixed in messagelib version 5.17.1
