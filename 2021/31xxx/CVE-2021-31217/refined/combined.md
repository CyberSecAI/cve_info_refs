# Dameware 12.2 release notes

Release date: June 2021

Dameware Remote Support includes a copy of Dameware Mini Remote Control, and at times, separate release notes may be published for each product. However, for Dameware 12.2 these release notes are the most recent for both products.

These release notes describe the new features, improvements, and fixed issues in Dameware 12.2. They also provide information about upgrades and describe workarounds for known issues.

**Due to improved security standards, Dameware 12.2 is not compatible with older agent versions. Agents must be removed and version 12.2 installed again through the application or re-installed via the agent installer.**

**Learn more**

* For information on the latest hotfixes, see [Dameware Hotfixes](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Dameware-Hotfix-Release-Notes?language=en_US).
* For release notes for previous Dameware versions, see [Previous Version documentation](../previous_versions.htm).
* For information about requirements, see Dameware [system requirements](../system_requirements/dameware_12-2_system_requirements.htm) and [port requirements](../install-drs-mrc-port-requirements-centralized.htm).
* For information about working with Dameware, see the [Dameware Administrator Guide](../dameware_administrator_guide.htm).

## New customer installation

[Return to top](#Top)

For information about installing Dameware, see the [Dameware Installation Guides](../dameware_install_or_upgrade_guide.htm).

## Installer List

Due to improved security standards, **Dameware** 12.2 is not compatible with older agent versions. Agents must be removed and version 12.2 installed again through the application or re-installed via the agent installer.

### Stand-alone installation

The stand-alone installation requires each product to be individually activated on each computer. It is most useful for organizations with a small user base or with small or decentralized IT departments. These installers are available through your customer portal.

| File name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| DamewareMRC64-St.exe | Dameware Mini Remote Control (64-bit) v12.2 Installer, used for stand-alone mode deployment |
| DamewareMRC32-St.exe | Dameware Mini Remote Control (32-bit) v12.2 Installer, used for stand-alone mode deployment |

### Centralized installation

The centralized installation requires you to install and deploy at least the Dameware Central Server. License activation occurs on the server level, and users authenticate to the Central Server from any centralized Mini Remote Control installation. Centralized mode is useful for organizations with a large user base, with large or centralized IT departments, or with multiple Dameware product licenses managed from a single point. You must request these installers from your SolarWinds sales representative.

If you use the Dameware Mobile application, Dameware Mobile for Android will not work with Dameware Remote Support 12.2. It is still possible to use Dameware Mobile for iOS version 11.4, which works for this release.

| File name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| DamewareMRC64.exe | Dameware Mini Remote Control (64-bit) v12.2 Installer, used for centralized mode deployment |
| DamewareMRC32.exe | Dameware Mini Remote Control (32-bit) v12.2 Installer, used to deploy all server roles, the Administration Console, and Dameware Remote Support v12.2 in centralized mode |

## Fixed issues in Dameware 12.2

[Return to top](#Top)

Dameware 12.2 fixes the following issues.

| Case Number | Description |
| --- | --- |
| N/A | While upgrading to Windows 10, the Windows setup utility temporarily removed the junction Application data in c:\ProgramData, causing the Dameware agent to create an Application Data folder in the ProgramData folder. Because the directory Application Data already existed in that folder, Windows could not recover or recreate the Application Data junction. This issue was fixed, and the problem is no longer occurring. |

### CVEs

SolarWinds would like to thank our Security Researchers below for reporting on the issue in a responsible manner and working with our security, product, and engineering teams to fix the vulnerability.

| CVE-ID | Vulnerability Title | Description | Severity | Credit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2021-31217 | Insecure file permissions allow local file deletion with system user access in Dameware 12.0.1.2008 | Insecure folder permissions of the Dameware Mini Remote Control Service installation (version 12.0.1.2008) allowed privileged system-level file deletion when a repair was initiated by the Windows Installer. | High | Adriaan Schuitmaker |
