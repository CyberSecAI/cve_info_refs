Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** Although the provided text mentions a vulnerability in Chevereto, it does not correspond to CVE-2021-31721. The exploit-db entry refers to a stored XSS vulnerability in Chevereto 3.17.1, which is not related to the provided CVE.

**Vulnerability:**
*   **Type:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Affected Version:** Chevereto 3.17.1

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when setting the title of an uploaded image. Specifically, the application does not properly encode or escape the title before displaying it, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Lack of proper input sanitization/encoding when handling image titles.
*   The application allows HTML tags in the image title field, which is not properly handled.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they view the image page.
*   This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Stealing cookies
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Other client-side attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attacker needs to be a user with the ability to upload images
*   The attacker modifies the title of an image with malicious JavaScript.
*   The malicious payload is stored on the server.
*   The XSS payload will be triggered when other users view the image.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   An attacker needs to have an account on the Chevereto instance and the ability to upload an image.
*   The attacker can edit the image title
*   No special network access is required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit is relatively straightforward to execute.
*   The provided Proof of Concept shows the attacker sets the title to  `"><svg/onload=alert(1)>` which executes a javascript alert box.
