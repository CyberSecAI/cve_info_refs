How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

## Installation

#### Automatic installation

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you donât even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type âDownload Monitorâ and click Search Plugins. Once youâve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by clicking *Install Now*.

#### Manual installation

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application.

* Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
* Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installationâs `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
* Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

## FAQ

### Can I upload .xxx filetype using the uploader?

Download Monitor uses the WordPress uploader for uploading files. By default these formats are supported:

* Images â .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif
* Documents â .pdf, .doc, .docx, .ppt, .pptx, .pps, .ppsx, .odt, .xls, .xlsx
* Music â .mp3, .m4a, .ogg, .wav
* Video â .mp4, .m4v, .mov, .wmv, .avi, .mpg, .ogv, .3gp, .3g2

To add more you can use a plugin, or filters. This post is a good resource for doing it with filters: [Change WordPress Upload Mime Types](http://www.paulund.co.uk/change-wordpress-upload-mime-types).

### Can I link to external downloads?

Yes, you can use both local paths and external URLs.

### My Download links 404

Download links are powered by endpoints. If you find them 404âing, go to Settings > Permalinks and save. This will flush the permalinks and allow our endpoints to be added.

### Download counts are not increasing when I download something

Admin hits are not counted, log out and try again!

Very useful. Have been using it for years on a non-profit site (dutchgrammar.org) that offers free PDF downloads of a Dutch grammar book in multiple languages. We can track which language versions have been downloaded the most.
