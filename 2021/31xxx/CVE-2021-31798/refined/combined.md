KL-001-2021-010:CyberArk Credential Provider Local Cache Can Be Decrypted

Title: CyberArk Credential Provider Local Cache Can Be Decrypted
Advisory ID: KL-001-2021-010
Publication Date: 2021.09.01
Publication URL: <https://korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2021-010.txt>

1. Vulnerability Details

     Affected Vendor: CyberArk
     Affected Product: Application Access Manager/Credential Provider
     Affected Version: Prior to 12.1
     Platform: Linux/Windows/zOS
     CWE Classification: CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
     CVE ID: CVE-2021-31798

2. Vulnerability Description

     CyberArk Credential Providers can be configured to retain
     passwords, password metadata, and other application properties
     in a local, encrypted cache file. Under certain conditions, the
     effective key space used to encrypt the cache is significantly
     reduced. For an attacker who understands the key derivation
     scheme and encryption mechanics, full access to the information
     used to derive the encryption key is sufficient to reduce
     effective key space to one. Even in cases where the information
     is not known, the encrypted cache files will likely be unable to
     withstand a brute force attack. However, the severity of this
     issue is partially mitigated by the privilege level required
     (root) for access.

3. Technical Description

     According to available online documentation [1], CyberArk cache
     files store three types of information: passwords and associated
     properties, application properties and authentication details,
     and relationships between applications and passwords.

     To maintain a high degree of availability, cached information
     is supplied even when the Vault cannot be accessed (e.g., due
     to a network outage). When the Vault is accessible, cached
     information is maintained periodically through a background
     refresh process, which is controlled by various configuration
     parameters. For a host system [NAME REDACTED], the following
     parameters were set in main_appprovider.conf.linux.9.95 under
     the Cache section:

       --- main_appprovider.conf.linux.9.95 ---
       CacheLevel=persistent
       CacheFile=/var/opt/CARKaim/cache/appprovider_cache.dat
       CacheRefreshInterval=180
       VaultAccessInterval=31536000
       --- main_appprovider.conf.linux.9.95 ---

     Cache files from the host system [NAME REDACTED]
     (appprovider_cache.dat and configuration_cache.dat) were
     collected, analyzed, and found to be encrypted on a line-by-line
     basis using AES in CBC mode with a 256-bit key. On the file
     system, these files were found to have sufficiently restrictive
     permissions. More specifically, their user/group ownerships were
     root/root, and their file permissions only allowed the root
     user read/write access. This implies that an attacker seeking
     to read or alter these files must first acquire root-level
     access. Note, however, that depending on the environment in
     which a given Credential Provider system operates, there may
     be other viable attack vectors (e.g., abuse of setuid/setgid
     executables, accessing the target file system while booted in
     or mounted from an alternate OS, unprotected backups, etc.).

     Based on analysis and observations, it was determined that
     the key material used to derive cache encryption keys are
     as follows:

       - application type (AppProvider, AIMAccount, or OPMProvider)
       - application user (Credential Provider username)
       - two undocumented, hard-coded byte sequences

     The application type (dubbed AppType) is transformed prior
     to being folded into the key derivation process. First,
     its ID (e.g., AppPrv for AppProvider) is converted to
     a lowercase string. Next, the lowercase string is hashed
     using SHA1. Finally, the resultant hash (in binary form)
     is encoded as a Base64 string. In the sections that follow,
     this transformed value will be referred to as AppTypeXForm.

     The application user (dubbed AppUser) is believed to be taken
     directly from the Username field of the Credential Provider's
     credential file (appprovideruser.cred). According to available
     online documentation [2], the username is established during
     Credential Provider installation, and the default value is
     "Prov_<servername>".

     According to RFC 1035 Section 2.3.1 [3]:

       [The labels must follow the rules for ARPANET host names.
       They must start with a letter, end with a letter or digit, and
       have as interior characters only letters, digits, and hyphen.
       There are also some restrictions on the length. Labels must
       be 63 characters or less.]

     The two undocumented, hard-coded byte sequences noted above
     (henceforth referred to as Suffix1 and Suffix2) were found
     embedded in the key derivation code.

     Given the above, the key derivation process can be summarized
     as follows:

       - start a pair of SHA1 hashes (Hash1 and Hash2)
       - update each hash with AppTypeXForm
       - update each hash with AppUser
       - update Hash1 with Suffix1
       - update Hash2 with Suffix2
       - finalize hashes
       - construct encryption key using Hash1[0:20] and Hash2[0:12]

     Unfortunately, the effective key space can be substantially
     less than the total key space, which is 2^256. This is due to
     a lack of entropy in the values used. The table below provides
     a qualified best case estimate for each value that can be used.

     +-----------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
     | Best Case Estimates                                                                                      |
     +-----------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
     | Item                  | Possible Values | Basis for Estimate                                             |
     +-----------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
     | AppTypeXForm          | =3              | actual number of known application types                       |
     | AppUser               | <=63^63         | "Prov_" plus up to 63 characters drawn from [0-9A-Za-z-]       |
     +-----------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+

     This yields an effective key space of:

       3 * 63^63

     or approximately 2^379. This is certainly better than 2^256,
     but it's not realistic because additional context will be
     available in the typical attack scenario: a cache file is
     found/accessed within the system/network where it was originally
     populated. With this scenario, an attacker will likely be able
     to significantly narrow the set of possible values for the
     AppUser. Note that if the appprovideruser.cred file or any
     of the application audit/console log files are accessible,
     this value is easily obtained/confirmed. The table below
     provides a more realistic set of estimates.

     +-----------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
     | Realistic Estimates                                                                                      |
     +-----------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
     | Item                  | Possible Values | Basis for Estimate                                             |
     +-----------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
     | AppTypeXForm          | =3              | actual number of known application types                       |
     | AppUser               | <=256           | "Prov_" plus direct lookup or site naming conventions          |
     +-----------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+

     This yields an effective key space of:

       3 * 256

     or approximately 2^10. Note that the work factor associated with
     this key space is trivial.

     In the case where an attacker has access to all the information
     used to derive the encryption key, the effective key space is
     reduced to one. To illustrate this point, consider the actual
     cache file shown below. Note that this file was originally
     decrypted using 'Prov_[REDACTED]' and subsequently re-encrypted
     using 'Prov_acme' as the value for AppUser.

1. Vulnerability Details
Affected Vendor: CyberArk
Affected Product: Application Access Manager/Credential Provider
Affected Version: Prior to 12.1
Platform: Linux/Windows/zOS
CWE Classification: CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
CVE ID: CVE-2021-31798
2. Vulnerability Description
CyberArk Credential Providers can be configured to retain
passwords, password metadata, and other application properties
in a local, encrypted cache file. Under certain conditions, the
effective key space used to encrypt the cache is significantly
reduced. For an attacker who understands the key derivation
scheme and encryption mechanics, full access to the information
used to derive the encryption key is sufficient to reduce
effective key space to one. Even in cases where the information
is not known, the encrypted cache files will likely be unable to
withstand a brute force attack. However, the severity of this
issue is partially mitigated by the privilege level required
(root) for access.
3. Technical Description
According to available online documentation [1], CyberArk cache
files store three types of information: passwords and associated
properties, application properties and authentication details,
and relationships between applications and passwords.
To maintain a high degree of availability, cached information
is supplied even when the Vault cannot be accessed (e.g., due
to a network outage). When the Vault is accessible, cached
information is maintained periodically through a background
refresh process, which is controlled by various configuration
parameters. For a host system [NAME REDACTED], the following
parameters were set in main\_appprovider.conf.linux.9.95 under
the Cache section:
--- main\_appprovider.conf.linux.9.95 ---
CacheLevel=persistent
CacheFile=/var/opt/CARKaim/cache/appprovider\_cache.dat
CacheRefreshInterval=180
VaultAccessInterval=31536000
--- main\_appprovider.conf.linux.9.95 ---
Cache files from the host system [NAME REDACTED]
(appprovider\_cache.dat and configuration\_cache.dat) were
collected, analyzed, and found to be encrypted on a line-by-line
basis using AES in CBC mode with a 256-bit key. On the file
system, these files were found to have sufficiently restrictive
permissions. More specifically, their user/group ownerships were
root/root, and their file permissions only allowed the root
user read/write access. This implies that an attacker seeking
to read or alter these files must first acquire root-level
access. Note, however, that depending on the environment in
which a given Credential Provider system operates, there may
be other viable attack vectors (e.g., abuse of setuid/setgid
executables, accessing the target file system while booted in
or mounted from an alternate OS, unprotected backups, etc.).
Based on analysis and observations, it was determined that
the key material used to derive cache encryption keys are
as follows:
- application type (AppProvider, AIMAccount, or OPMProvider)
- application user (Credential Provider username)
- two undocumented, hard-coded byte sequences
The application type (dubbed AppType) is transformed prior
to being folded into the key derivation process. First,
its ID (e.g., AppPrv for AppProvider) is converted to
a lowercase string. Next, the lowercase string is hashed
using SHA1. Finally, the resultant hash (in binary form)
is encoded as a Base64 string. In the sections that follow,
this transformed value will be referred to as AppTypeXForm.
The application user (dubbed AppUser) is believed to be taken
directly from the Username field of the Credential Provider's
credential file (appprovideruser.cred). According to available
online documentation [2], the username is established during
Credential Provider installation, and the default value is
"Prov\_".
According to RFC 1035 Section 2.3.1 [3]:
[The labels must follow the rules for ARPANET host names.
They must start with a letter, end with a letter or digit, and
have as interior characters only letters, digits, and hyphen.
There are also some restrictions on the length. Labels must
be 63 characters or less.]
The two undocumented, hard-coded byte sequences noted above
(henceforth referred to as Suffix1 and Suffix2) were found
embedded in the key derivation code.
Given the above, the key derivation process can be summarized
as follows:
- start a pair of SHA1 hashes (Hash1 and Hash2)
- update each hash with AppTypeXForm
- update each hash with AppUser
- update Hash1 with Suffix1
- update Hash2 with Suffix2
- finalize hashes
- construct encryption key using Hash1[0:20] and Hash2[0:12]
Unfortunately, the effective key space can be substantially
less than the total key space, which is 2^256. This is due to
a lack of entropy in the values used. The table below provides
a qualified best case estimate for each value that can be used.
+-----------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Best Case Estimates |
+-----------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Item | Possible Values | Basis for Estimate |
+-----------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| AppTypeXForm | =3 | actual number of known application types |
| AppUser | <=63^63 | "Prov\_" plus up to 63 characters drawn from [0-9A-Za-z-] |
+-----------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
This yields an effective key space of:
3 \* 63^63
or approximately 2^379. This is certainly better than 2^256,
but it's not realistic because additional context will be
available in the typical attack scenario: a cache file is
found/accessed within the system/network where it was originally
populated. With this scenario, an attacker will likely be able
to significantly narrow the set of possible values for the
AppUser. Note that if the appprovideruser.cred file or any
of the application audit/console log files are accessible,
this value is easily obtained/confirmed. The table below
provides a more realistic set of estimates.
+-----------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Realistic Estimates |
+-----------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Item | Possible Values | Basis for Estimate |
+-----------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| AppTypeXForm | =3 | actual number of known application types |
| AppUser | <=256 | "Prov\_" plus direct lookup or site naming conventions |
+-----------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
This yields an effective key space of:
3 \* 256
or approximately 2^10. Note that the work factor associated with
this key space is trivial.
In the case where an attacker has access to all the information
used to derive the encryption key, the effective key space is
reduced to one. To illustrate this point, consider the actual
cache file shown below. Note that this file was originally
decrypted using 'Prov\_[REDACTED]' and subsequently re-encrypted
using 'Prov\_acme' as the value for AppUser.
