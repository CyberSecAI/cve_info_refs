The provided content relates to CVE-2021-31615, as it describes the "InjectaBLE" vulnerability.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a packet-injection scenario on unencrypted Bluetooth LE baseband links. An attacker can inject a crafted packet by spoofing the Central device's address during the time window between when the Peripheral receives a packet from the Central and the time the Central actually transmits during the connection interval.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of encryption on Bluetooth LE baseband links, allowing for packet injection and spoofing. The vulnerability is present in Bluetooth Core Specifications versions 4.0 through 5.2.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An attacker can spoof the Central or Peripheral device to the device in the opposing role.
    - An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack by establishing themselves as the Central role to the Peripheral, taking over the Peripheral role, and then modifying, suppressing or injecting any traffic.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted packet injected into an unencrypted Bluetooth LE link by an attacker spoofing the central device's address.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be within range to intercept and inject packets into the communication between a central and peripheral Bluetooth LE device.

The content also notes that the Bluetooth SIG is recommending that implementations verify they are using encryption in any profile that requires it, and that vendor-specific profile implementations with custom attributes require encryption for both read and write operations on those characteristics by default. They are also communicating details on the vulnerability and its remedies to their member companies.
