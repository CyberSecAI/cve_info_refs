Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31608:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the URL rewrite feature in Proofpoint Enterprise Protection (PPS/PoD) failing to properly match URLs with invalid schemes. Browsers often auto-correct these invalid schemes into valid ones, but the Proofpoint URL rewrite mechanism does not handle this auto-correction, leading to a bypass.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **URL Rewrite Bypass:** The core vulnerability is the failure of the URL rewrite functionality in Proofpoint to process URLs with invalid schemes that browsers will correct. This bypass prevents the expected rewriting of the URL.
- **Incorrect Scheme Handling**: The system does not handle invalid URL schemes which are then automatically corrected by browsers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypassed URL Rewriting:** Successfully exploited, this vulnerability allows malicious URLs to be delivered to end-users without being rewritten by Proofpoint.
- **Delivery of Unsanitized URLs:** Users receive the original, potentially malicious URLs directly, bypassing Proofpoint's protection mechanisms.
- **User Interaction Required:** Users have to click on the delivered URLs to be impacted by the malicious content.
- **Click-time Protection Bypass:** While other email protection features of Proofpoint remain in place, the click-time protection provided by URL rewriting is bypassed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Delivery:** Attackers send emails containing malicious URLs with invalid URL schemes.
- **Invalid URL Schemes:** Attackers use crafted URLs with invalid schemes that browsers auto-correct.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Send Emails:** The attacker must be able to send emails to the target recipients.
- **Crafted URLs:** The attacker needs to create URLs with invalid schemes that will be automatically corrected by the user's browser into a working malicious URL.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability only affects the URL rewrite feature and doesn't bypass other email security features like spam filtering or attachment checks.
- The vulnerability is exploitable in Outlook for Windows and potentially other email clients.
- Fixes have been released in Proofpoint versions 8.13 (LTS), 8.16 and newer, however proofpoint on demand customers were already patched.
- The CVSS score is 7.4 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N) indicating a high severity due to the potential for a successful attack to have high impact on the integrity of the systems being used.
