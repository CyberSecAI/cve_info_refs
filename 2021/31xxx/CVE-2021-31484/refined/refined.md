  "CVE-2021-31484": {
    "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of OpenText Brava! Desktop. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DWF files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the parsing of DWF files, where the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data leads to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write due to improper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DWF files."
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a user visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious DWF file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious DWF file or create a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability when a user interacts with it."
