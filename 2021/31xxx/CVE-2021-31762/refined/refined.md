Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-31762:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in Webmin's user management functionality. Specifically, the "add users" feature lacks proper CSRF protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF:** The core issue is the absence of CSRF protection in the Webmin user creation form. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, will create a new administrative user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution:** By creating a privileged user, an attacker gains control over the Webmin interface. They can then use other Webmin features, such as the "running process" feature, to execute arbitrary commands on the server, achieving Remote Command Execution (RCE).
- **Complete System Compromise:** Gaining RCE on a server through a web interface like Webmin will give the attacker the ability to perform further malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **CSRF Attack:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page or uses other methods (e.g., malicious link in an email, watering hole attack, etc.) to induce a logged-in Webmin user to submit a request to add a new, privileged user.
- **Exploitation via Web Browser:** The victim needs to have an active, authenticated Webmin session when they are tricked into visiting the malicious page or clicking the link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Direct Access Needed:** The attacker does not need to have direct access to the Webmin server. They only need the target to be logged into Webmin and then tricked into triggering the malicious request.
- **Knowledge of Webmin:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the Webmin interface and its user creation form to craft the CSRF attack.

**Additional Technical Details**
- The exploit detailed in the provided github links uses a python script (`eXploit.py`) to perform the attack.
- The targeted version for the proof of concept is Webmin 1.973.
- The exploit chain involves two steps: first creating an admin user through the CSRF vulnerability, and then using the created user to obtain a reverse shell on the target.

In summary, CVE-2021-31762 is a CSRF vulnerability in Webmin that allows an attacker to create a privileged user. This can be chained to RCE using other Webmin features.
