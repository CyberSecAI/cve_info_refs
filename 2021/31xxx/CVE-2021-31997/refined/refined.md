Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `postorius-permissions.sh` script, which is part of the `python-postorius` package. This script is executed during the `%post` section of the `postorius-web` package installation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unconditional Ownership Changes:** The script recursively changes ownership and ACL settings on directories `/var/lib/postorius/data` and `/var/log/postorius` without checking existing ownership.
*   **Symbolic Link Vulnerability:** The script performs these operations as root on directories owned by `postorius` or `postorius-admin` users. This allows a malicious actor to create symbolic links within these directories, pointing to arbitrary locations on the filesystem. When the script is executed it would then recursively change ownership of the pointed files to `postorius` or `postorius-admin`
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A compromised `postorius` or `postorius-admin` user can exploit this vulnerability to gain root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged `postorius` or `postorius-admin` user can gain root access to the system.
*   **Arbitrary File Ownership Change:** The attacker can change the ownership of arbitrary files and directories on the system to gain access or manipulate data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have access to a compromised `postorius` or `postorius-admin` user account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Compromised User:** The attacker needs a compromised `postorius` or `postorius-admin` user account.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is similar to one found in `python-HyperKitty` (CVE-2021-25322).
*   The fix involved the removal of the vulnerable script.
*   The script is identified as SUSE-specific.
*   The issue was initially resolved as "WONTFIX" due to the package being removed from Factory and an older version without the script existing in Leap 15.2.
