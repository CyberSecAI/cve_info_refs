Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31926:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check in the `ModifyCustomFirewallRule` API endpoint of the AMP Application Deployment Service. This endpoint, intended for modifying firewall rules, was not correctly restricted, allowing authenticated users without the necessary permissions to make changes to the system's firewall configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks for the `ModifyCustomFirewallRule` API endpoint. The API call to modify network information (ports) required the global `Reconfigure` permission for ADS, but the specific `ModifyCustomFirewallRule` function was missing the metadata that enforced this restriction.
*   **Incorrect UI Behavior**: The user interface allowed users without the necessary permission to view and interact with the port editing dialog, which was misleading. Though the user interface did not reflect actual changes until clicking "save", the UI did allow unprivileged users to interact with the interface implying the changes were being applied immediately, without the proper checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Firewall Changes:**  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to open arbitrary ports on the system's firewall, potentially exposing services or applications that should not be publicly accessible.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** By opening ports, the attacker could create new attack vectors into the system, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct API Request:** The attack vector involves crafting a direct HTTP(S) request to the vulnerable `ModifyCustomFirewallRule` API endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the CubeCoders AMP. The vulnerability could not be exploited by an unauthenticated user.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP(S) requests to the AMP server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was discovered by a user, Fabrimat, who noticed that adding custom ports through the "Edit ports" interface was possible even without the required permissions.
*   Initially, it was believed that changes were not applied without the correct permissions, but it was found that the changes to the firewall were indeed applied immediately when clicking the "+" button in the edit dialog.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.1.1.2 of CubeCoders AMP.

This information provides a good understanding of the vulnerability and how it could be exploited.
