{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Bluetooth Classic implementation in Silicon Labs iWRAP 6.3.0 and earlier does not properly handle the reception of an oversized LMP packet greater than 17 bytes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of oversized Link Manager Protocol (LMP) packets.",
      "Lack of input validation on LMP packet lengths."
    ],
    "impact": "A denial of service (DoS) due to a firmware crash on the target device (WT32i). This can lead to sporadic disruptions in Bluetooth communication.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Over-the-air transmission of crafted LMP packets with oversized payload.",
       "Exploitation of a vulnerability in the lower layers of the Bluetooth stack."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Attacker must be within radio range of the target device.",
       "Ability to craft and transmit malformed LMP packets using a custom (non-compliant) LMP firmware.",
       "Knowledge of the target's Bluetooth device address (BDAddress)."
    ],
    "additional_information": "The attack involves sending an LMP packet with an ACL size exceeding 17 bytes, bypassing length checks and resulting in a firmware crash. The vulnerability is triggered after several attempts of sending the crafted packet during repeated connections. The target device may need around 3-5 minutes to crash."
