      "root_cause": "The 'forgot password' functionality in the application displays different responses (in size) when a user exists versus when a user does not exist.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "User enumeration vulnerability through password reset functionality.",
         "Information disclosure"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can enumerate valid users on the system and even Active Directory users when AD authentication is enabled. This is because the 'forgot password' page gives different responses when a user is valid or invalid. This vulnerability can lead to the enumeration of internal domain users if the server is exposed to the Internet.",

      "required_attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target application. Having knowledge of AD username format increases chances of successful exploitation. ",
       "additional_details": "The provided content includes a Python script that automates the attack by sending requests to the '/ForgotPassword.sd' endpoint and then comparing the length of the responses, to identify valid users. The script takes the target URL, domain, and a file containing a list of usernames as input. It also includes the full python exploit code."
