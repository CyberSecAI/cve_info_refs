    "related_to_cve": true,
    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-31785",
    "description": "The Bluetooth Classic implementation on Actions ATS2815/ATS2819 chipsets does not properly handle the reception of multiple LMP_host_connection_req. This allows attackers in radio range to trigger a denial of service (deadlock) if no user is connected to the target. Manual user intervention is required to restart the device and restore Bluetooth communication.",
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of multiple LMP_host_connection_req packets.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of proper input validation.",
      "Insufficient resource management."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (deadlock) of the Bluetooth functionality. The device requires manual reboot/restart to restore Bluetooth communication.",
     "attack_vector": "An attacker within Bluetooth radio range sends multiple LMP_host_connection_req packets to the target device.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be within Bluetooth radio range. No prior pairing or authentication is needed."
  }
