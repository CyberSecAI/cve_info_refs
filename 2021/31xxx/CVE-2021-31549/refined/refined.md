Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31549:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient visibility checks within the AbuseFilter extension of MediaWiki. Specifically, the `Special:AbuseFilter/examine` and `/test` pages were not properly filtering suppressed usernames. This allowed users without oversight rights to view suppressed edits and usernames when they should not have access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The core weakness is an information leak where suppressed usernames and associated edits could be viewed by unauthorized users via the `Special:AbuseFilter/examine` and `/test` pages.
*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The system failed to enforce proper visibility checks based on user roles, specifically failing to prevent users without oversight from seeing suppressed content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privacy Violation:** Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the exposure of usernames and edits that were intended to be hidden for privacy reasons. This could damage the privacy of users who had their usernames suppressed.
*   **Circumvention of Oversight:** The vulnerability circumvents the intended oversight mechanism by allowing users without the correct permissions to view sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access:** An attacker could directly navigate to `Special:AbuseFilter/examine` and `/test`.
*   **Form Submission:** The attacker can enter a suppressed username into the user field in the form and submit it to view the suppressed user and edits.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic User Access:** An attacker would only need a basic user account or no account and would be logged out.
*   **Knowledge of Suppressed Username:** The attacker would need to know or guess a suppressed username to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by applying proper visibility checks and removing deleted rows from the `/examine` and `/test` pages.
*   Patches were created for multiple branches of the MediaWiki AbuseFilter extension (master, REL1\_35, REL1\_31).
*   The fix also involved logic similar to [T233222](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T233222).
*   The issue was also reported to affect the `/test` page.
*   The fix has been deployed and the issue is marked as resolved.
*   The fix was backported to multiple MediaWiki versions.
