The relevant entry for CVE-2021-31901 is:

| **Product** | **Description** | **Severity** | **Resolved in** | **CVE/CWE** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hub | Two-factor authentication wasn’t enabled properly for the “All Users” group (JPS-10694) | Low | 2021.1.13079 | [CVE-2021-31901](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-31901) |

Based on this, here's the breakdown:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Two-factor authentication (2FA) was not properly enabled for the "All Users" group in JetBrains Hub.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper enforcement of 2FA for a specific user group.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: Accounts belonging to the "All Users" group might be vulnerable to unauthorized access if 2FA is not enforced correctly. This can potentially lead to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or complete account takeover, depending on the privileges associated with those user accounts.
*   **Attack vectors**: An attacker could potentially gain access to user accounts in the "All Users" group if they have the correct credentials, as the expected 2FA protection may be bypassed due to the vulnerability.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to have valid user credentials (username/password) for an account within the affected "All Users" group. The attacker would be able to log in without needing a second factor of authentication.
