Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-31548:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the AbuseFilter extension of MediaWiki. The vulnerability occurs when a user is partially blocked, and the system fails to properly disallow an edit due to the block not fully succeeding. This results in the AbuseFilter allowing an edit that should have been blocked.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary weakness is a missing or insufficient authorization check within the AbuseFilter. Specifically, it fails to consistently enforce the block action when a user is partially blocked. The system checks for the block but does not verify if the block was successful in a manner that prevents the user from editing.
*   **Partial Block Handling:** The system's logic for handling partial blocks is flawed. Instead of preventing the action entirely, it allows the edit to go through if the blocking mechanism fails.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Circumvention of Block:**  An attacker could circumvent intended blocks placed on their account.
*   **Potential for Abuse:** This circumvention could enable a blocked user to continue actions they were intended to be restricted from.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Manipulation:** A malicious user, who has been partially blocked, could exploit this to make edits that should have been blocked.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Partial Block Status:** The attacker needs to be in a state of being partially blocked within the MediaWiki system.
*   **Edit Action:** The attacker has to attempt an edit action that should be prevented by the partial block.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involved ensuring that edits are disallowed if the blocking of a user is not fully successful.
*   The issue was addressed with a patch on Gerrit and subsequently backported.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as "Vuln-MissingAuthz," which means it involves missing authorization.
