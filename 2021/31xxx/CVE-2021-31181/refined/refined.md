Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31181:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft SharePoint handles server-side controls within WebParts.
- Specifically, the issue occurs when a control is specified using a non-canonical string, leading to the instantiation of an unsafe server-side control.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of user-supplied input when specifying server-side controls within WebParts.
- Instantiation of unsafe server-side controls due to non-canonical string usage.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE) on affected Microsoft SharePoint installations.
- The attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the SharePoint service account.
- This allows the attacker to potentially gain full control over the SharePoint server and the data it manages.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack (AV:N)
- The attacker sends crafted requests to a vulnerable SharePoint server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the SharePoint environment (PR:L).
- The attack does not require any user interaction (UI:N).
- The vulnerability does not require any special privileges beyond a standard authenticated user.
