Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-31483:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow that occurs due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. This occurs during the parsing of DWF files in OpenText Brava! Desktop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow.
- Insufficient data validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to get the target user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The malicious file would be crafted to trigger the buffer overflow by exploiting the DWF file parsing vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to create a malicious DWF file.
- The attacker must be able to deliver the malicious DWF file to the target, either via a web page or by tricking the user into opening the file locally.
- User interaction is required, as the target must open the malicious file or visit a webpage hosting it.
