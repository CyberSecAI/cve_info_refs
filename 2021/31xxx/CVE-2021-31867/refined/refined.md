Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-31867:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-31867

**Affected Product:** Pimcore Customer Data Framework (CDF) v3.0.0

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a result of unsanitized input being directly used in an SQL query. The `$id` parameter from the HTTP request is directly incorporated into the SQL query via `sprintf` without proper sanitization or parameterized queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization when constructing the SQL query using the `id` parameter. Specifically, it's a Boolean-based Blind SQL Injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** A malicious actor can extract sensitive information from the database. While the injection is blind, an attacker can use a series of true/false SQL queries to programmatically piece together database content.
- **Potential for other attacks:** While not specifically mentioned in the content provided, SQL injection vulnerabilities can sometimes also lead to other attacks (depending on the database permissions), such as privilege escalation or the ability to modify data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker can send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint (`/admin/object/grid-proxy`), modifying the `id` parameter to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Pimcore CDF instance.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/admin/object/grid-proxy`) and the vulnerable parameter `id`.
- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker must understand how to construct SQL injection payloads for the specific database in use to retrieve data.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `SegmentAssignmentController.php`.
- The vulnerable code was introduced in commit 6fc8aff8f95fc168d173ef3b473760dd98d026c4.
- The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection. This means the attacker cannot directly see the results of their SQL queries in the application's responses but can infer information based on different responses (e.g., 200 OK vs. 500 Internal Server Error).

**Remediation:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.0.2 of the Pimcore Customer Data Framework. Users of affected versions should upgrade to the fixed version or later.
