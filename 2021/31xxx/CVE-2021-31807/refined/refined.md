Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31807:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an incorrect memory management bug within the Squid caching proxy. Specifically, it's related to how Squid handles partial content parsing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-After-Free vulnerability in the partial content parsing of HTTP responses, triggered through HTTP Range requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition affecting all clients using the proxy.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP Range request to the Squid proxy. This can be done either by a malicious client or a malicious origin server returning a crafted `Content-Range` header.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Squid proxy. This can be either a client directly connected to the proxy or a malicious origin server that the proxy is communicating with.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a specific HTTP Range header to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Joshua Rogers of Opera Software.
- Patches are available in Squid versions 4.15 and 5.0.6.
- A more detailed explanation including proof of concept is available on GitHub: <https://megamansec.github.io/Squid-Security-Audit/>.
- NetApp products using Squid were also affected by this vulnerability
- The vulnerability is related to improper memory management during the handling of partial content responses, specifically when processing HTTP Range headers.
- Fedora 33 and 34 were affected, and a fix was released with updated Squid packages.
