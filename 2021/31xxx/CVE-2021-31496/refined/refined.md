{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DXF files, leading to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves a user opening a malicious DXF file or visiting a malicious page containing such a file. This requires user interaction.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted malicious DXF file and have the target user open this file or visit a page that triggers the processing of the malicious file."
