Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-31220

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in a missing access check in SES Evolution that allows users with read-only access to security policies to modify them.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Insufficient access control, allowing modification of security policies by read-only users.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can trick a user with read-only access to execute a malicious program, which in turn modifies security policies with malicious content. This modified policy will be used the next time changes are deployed in the environment, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Adjacent Network:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable system.
    *   **User Interaction:**  The attacker needs to trick a user with read-only access into running a malicious program.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have a presence on the same network as the vulnerable system.
