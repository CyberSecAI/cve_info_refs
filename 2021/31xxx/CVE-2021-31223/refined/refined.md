Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31223:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists due to insufficient access control checks in SES Evolution before version 2.1.0. This allows unauthorized reading of certain security policy data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Access control bypass:** The system fails to properly restrict access to parts of the security policy, which an attacker can exploit.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality breach:** An attacker can read security policy scripts, including those executed upon detecting malicious actions or determining the applicable security policy.
- The attacker can potentially gain insight into the security configuration of the system

**Attack vectors:**
- **Adjacent network:** An attacker on the same network as a machine with the SES Evolution console installed can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Proximity:**  The attacker needs to be on the same network as a machine with the SES Evolution console installed.
- **User interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user logged into the machine with the SES console to execute a malicious program.
- No privileges are required as the attack exploits a user session and lack of access control.

**Additional details:**
- **Affected product:** Stormshield Endpoint Security (SES) versions 2.0.0 to 2.0.2
- **CVSS Score:**
  - Base Score: 5.7
  - Temporal Score: 5.1
  - Environmental Score: 5.1
- **Mitigation:** Upgrade to SES Evolution version 2.1.0 or later. There is no workaround available.
-  Proof of concept code is available.
