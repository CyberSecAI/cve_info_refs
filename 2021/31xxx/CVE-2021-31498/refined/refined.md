Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-31498:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of DWF files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The lack of validation allows an attacker to craft a malicious DWF file that, when parsed, leads to a read operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated data structure. This is also described as a "read past the end of an allocated data structure."

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the disclosure of sensitive information. The vulnerability enables an attacker to potentially read data from memory that they are not authorized to access.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** The advisory notes that this vulnerability "can be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process." This implies that the information disclosure could be a stepping stone for more severe attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File:** The attacker crafts a specially designed DWF file.
- **User Interaction:** The victim needs to open the malicious DWF file using the vulnerable OpenText Brava! Desktop application. Alternatively, visiting a malicious page that triggers parsing of the file could also be an attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious DWF file and have the user open it. No specific attacker position is mentioned, implying the attacker can be located remotely.
- The attacker also needs to know that the victim is using a vulnerable version of OpenText Brava! Desktop.

**Additional Details:**
- Affected Product: OpenText Brava! Desktop 16.6.3.84
- Fixed in version: 16.6.4.114
- ZDI identifier: ZDI-CAN-12744
