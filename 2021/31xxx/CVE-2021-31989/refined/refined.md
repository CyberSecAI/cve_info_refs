- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in AXIS Device Manager's (ADM) handling of device credentials stored in RAM.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Device credentials are not adequately protected in RAM, allowing them to be extracted through memory dumps.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially extract credentials of connected Axis devices from a memory dump.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to log on to the machine hosting the ADM client and create a memory dump using the built-in Windows Task Manager.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have privileges to run AXIS Device Manager and have sufficient knowledge to create a memory dump.
