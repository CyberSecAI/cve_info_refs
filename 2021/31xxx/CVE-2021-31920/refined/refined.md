- **Root cause of vulnerability:** HTTP request paths with multiple slashes or escaped slash characters (`%2F` or `%5C`) are not normalized consistently by Istio's authorization policies and backend services.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inconsistent path normalization between Istio's authorization policies and backend services allows for authorization bypass. Specifically, authorization policies that use `ALLOW action + notPaths field` or `DENY action + paths field` are vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can bypass path-based authorization policies, gaining access to resources that should be restricted. For example, a request to `//admin` can bypass a policy that denies access to `/admin`. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the backend service.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending HTTP requests with multiple slashes or escaped slash characters in the URL path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Istio service mesh with manipulated URL paths, with knowledge of the authorization policies in place.
