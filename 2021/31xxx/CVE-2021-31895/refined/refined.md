- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The DHCP client in affected devices fails to properly sanitize incoming DHCP packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow (CWE-120) due to insufficient input sanitization of DHCP packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could cause memory to be overwritten, potentially leading to remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted DHCP packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires network access to the affected device. No authentication is required.
