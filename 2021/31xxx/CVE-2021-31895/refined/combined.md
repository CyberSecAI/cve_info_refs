WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Enabling DHCP snooping ensures that the DHCP client in the affected devices will only accept

DHCP requests from trusted DHCP servers

• Disable DHCP and conﬁgure a static IP address to the device

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

RUGGEDCOM ROS-based devices, typically switches and serial-to-Ethernet devices, are used to connect
devices that operate in harsh environments such as electric utility substations and trafﬁc control cabinets.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-31895

The DHCP client in affected devices fails to properly sanitize incoming DHCP packets. This could
allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause memory to be overwritten, potentially allowing
remote code execution.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS Vector
CWE

8.1
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input (‘Classic
Buffer Overﬂow’)
