Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-31400:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the TCP out-of-band (OOB) urgent data processing function within the NicheStack TCP/IP stack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The TCP OOB urgent data processing function doesn't properly check if the pointer to the end of the OOB urgent data points outside the bounds of the TCP segment's data. Specifically, the pointer is not validated against the TCP segment's boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** If the pointer to the end of the OOB data points outside of the TCP segment's data, the affected function invokes a panic function. If this panic function doesn't have a trap invocation removed, it results in an infinite loop, causing a DoS condition which can be in the form of a continuous loop or a device reset.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is performed by sending specially crafted TCP packets containing OOB urgent data.
*   **Remote:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely by sending the malformed TCP packets to a vulnerable device on the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a device using the vulnerable NicheStack TCP/IP stack.
*   The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is present in all versions of NicheStack before 4.3, including NicheLite.
* HCC Embedded has released patches that are available upon request.
* This vulnerability is part of a larger set of 14 vulnerabilities discovered in the NicheStack TCP/IP stack, collectively known as INFRA:HALT.
