{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `page_recent_contributors` function in MediaWiki's AbuseFilter extension was not properly checking revision visibility, leading to a potential information leak.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Leak",
      "Improper Access Control"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially reveal the usernames of suppressed editors by accessing the `page_recent_contributors` variable, even when those edits were intended to be hidden.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by viewing the page\_recent\_contributors variable which leaks revdeleted user names.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to have the ability to view the `page_recent_contributors` variable, typically through the AbuseFilter interface or by triggering a filter that uses the variable. No special permissions needed to access the information if the user has access to the page where the variable is exposed."
  },
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability was present because the function did not check if a revision had been deleted or suppressed before including the username in the list of contributors. This was addressed by ensuring that the function checks revision visibility when retrieving variables from the recent changes table, and filtering out deleted revisions. The issue was fixed in the AbuseFilter extension, and backported to multiple MediaWiki versions. The `page_first_contributor` variable was not affected, as it already used `FOR_PUBLIC` audience, effectively excluding deleted content. There is a related issue (point 3 in the Description section of the Phabricator task) involving data baked into the abuse log which was considered too difficult to fix and for which oversight is expected to manually suppress log entries. The fix also addresses a similar information leak related to the /examine interface.",
   "resolution": "The issue was resolved by modifying the AbuseFilter extension code. Patches were applied to multiple branches of the extension. Additionally, the security team took steps to ensure the patch was properly applied across relevant MediaWiki instances."
