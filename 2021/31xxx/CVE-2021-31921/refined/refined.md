- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of `AUTO_PASSTHROUGH` routing configuration in Istio Gateways.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Bypassing authorization checks, allowing access to unexpected services.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An external client can access services within the cluster that they are not authorized to access.
- **Attack vectors**: An external client sends requests through a gateway configured with `AUTO_PASSTHROUGH`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an external client with network access to the vulnerable Istio gateway.
