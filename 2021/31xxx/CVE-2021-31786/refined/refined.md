{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Bluetooth Classic Audio implementation on products based on Actions ATS2815/ATS2819 chipset does not properly handle a connection attempt from a host with the same BDAddress as the currently connected BT host.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of connection attempts with duplicate BDAddresses"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) and intentionally deadlock the target device. The user needs to reboot the target device to restore BT functionality.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Bluetooth communication"
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be within radio range and be able to connect to the target Bluetooth device with a forged BDAddress matching the currently connected host."
