# Timing side channel vulnerability in endpoint request handler in Vaadin 15-19

Severity:

 Medium (Base score 4.0) [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

CVE entry:

 [CVE-2021-31406](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-31406)

## Overview

Non-constant-time comparison of CSRF tokens in endpoint request handler in `com.vaadin:flow-server` versions 3.0.0 through 5.0.3 (Vaadin 15.0.0 through 18.0.6), and `com.vaadin:fusion-endpoint` version 6.0.0 (Vaadin 19.0.0) allows attacker to guess a security token for Fusion endpoints via timing attack.

See [CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/208.html)

## Description

Vaadin applications use different types of tokens for different purposes, such as preventing CSRF, managing Push and Upload requests. The token checking implementation was subject to the theoretical possibility of timing attacks based on how long it takes for a request with invalid token to be rejected.

We identified that the previous fix for this issue was incomplete. The CSRF token checking in the Fusion endpoints was neglected. We apologize for pushing out an incomplete fix.

These timing attacks could result in exposure of the user's token, which can be used to blindly submit data on the user's behalf, without the possibility of reading back the responses, or of opening websockets and listening for published data from the server for that user, which may or may not contain sensitive information due to the application’s nature.

The vulnerability is fixed using constant-time comparison for all security tokens to prevent these potential timing attacks. Applications using the affected Vaadin versions should all be updated to the latest maintenance release.

## Affected products and mitigation

Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation or upgrade. Releases that have fixed this issue include:

| Product version | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Vaadin 15 - 17 | No longer supported. Upgrade to 18.0.7 or newer version |
| Vaadin 18.0.0 - 18.0.6 | Upgrade to 18.0.7 or newer 18 version |
| Vaadin 19.0.0 | Upgrade to 19.0.1 or newer 19 version |

Please note that Vaadin versions 15-17 are no longer supported and you should update either to the latest 18 version respectively.

## Artifacts

| Maven coordinates | Vulnerable version | Fixed version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| com.vaadin:flow-server | 3.0 - 4.0 | N/A |
| com.vaadin:flow-server | 5.0.0 - 5.0.3 | ≥ 5.0.4 |
| com.vaadin:flow-server | 6.0.0 | ≥ 6.0.1 |

This hardens the framework against a theoretical timing attack based on

comparing how quickly a request with an invalid CSRF token is rejected.

No tests since this functionality is equivalent to the previous implementation aside from timing differences that would be very fragile to verify in an automated test.
