Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-31221:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access checks within the SES Evolution software. Specifically, the software allows deletion of security policy elements (application identifiers) through the administration console, even without proper authorization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control that prevents unauthorized users from modifying security policies.
- **Indirect Object Reference:** The vulnerability is leveraged by using an access to a computer with administration console installed and tricking a user into executing malicious code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Policy Disruption:** An attacker can delete application identifiers, which are crucial for enforcing security policies, preventing the application of further security policies on the environment.
- **Availability Impact:** The primary impact is on availability, as security policies cannot be effectively enforced.
- **No Confidentiality/Integrity Impact:** The attack does not expose confidential information nor directly alter the system's integrity.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Adjacent Network:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the targeted system.
- **Malicious Code Execution:** The attack involves tricking a user on a machine with the SES Evolution console to run a malicious program.
- **User Interaction Required:** User interaction is required to execute the malicious program.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Adjacent Network access:** Attacker must have network access to a machine where the SES Evolution console is installed.
- **Social Engineering/Malware Delivery:** The attacker must trick a user into executing the malicious code.
- **No Privileges Required**: The attacker doesn't need any special privileges on the target system.

**Affected versions:**
- SES 2.0.0 to 2.0.2

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to SES Evolution 2.1.0 or later, which contains the fix for this vulnerability.
