### @nmeum **[nmeum](/nmeum)** commented [Feb 8, 2021](#issue-803639548)

### Contribution description

This is relevant as `clif_decode_link` may invoke `clif_get_attr` with `input_len == 0`.

### Testing procedure

Example application:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <clif.h>

#define MAX_EXPECTED_ATTRS (6)
static uint8_t buf[] = { 60, 193, 62, 59, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, };

int main(void)
{
        char *input = (char *)&buf[0];
	clif_t lookif;
	clif_attr_t attrs[MAX_EXPECTED_ATTRS];

	clif_decode_link(&lookif, attrs, MAX_EXPECTED_ATTRS, input, sizeof(buf));

	return 0;
}
```

Minimal `Makefile`:

```
APPLICATION = clif

BOARD = native

USEMODULE += clif

RIOTBASE ?= $(CURDIR)/../..
include $(RIOTBASE)/Makefile.include
```

Invoke using:

```
$ make -C examples/clif all-asan
$ make -C examples/clif term

| Since you already wrote some example code, want to also add that to `tests/unittests/tests-clif/tests-clif.c`?  This case is pretty trivial though, still it had not been spotted so far. |
