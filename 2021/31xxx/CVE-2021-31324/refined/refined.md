The provided content is related to CVE-2021-31324.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the password reset procedure in CentOS Web Panel, specifically within the `index.php?acc=newpass` endpoint. The `idsession` HTTP POST parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection. This injection allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL query results, which are subsequently used in a `shell_exec` function, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The `idsession` parameter allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.
*   **Command Injection:** The injected SQL query results are used in a `shell_exec` call, allowing arbitrary shell commands to be executed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to achieve root remote code execution on the CentOS Web Panel host.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploited through an HTTP POST request to the password reset endpoint (`/login/index.php?acc=newpass`). The `idsession` parameter within the POST data is used to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable CentOS Web Panel instance. No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, making it easily exploitable remotely.
