  "CVE-2021-2175": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the insufficient access control for the DBA_DV_REALM data dictionary view, which exposes database vault metadata.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient access control, metadata exposure",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with the ORACLE_OCM account (or similar), can bypass intended access controls and view the DBA_DV_REALM data dictionary view. This exposes the security measures, including the realms configured within the database vault. This can lead to attackers gaining valuable information about the security configuration of the database.",
      "Attack vectors": "Bypassing access control through the ORACLE_OCM account or similar to access the DBA_DV_REALM data dictionary view.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker requires an account with the ability to create views and select from them (e.g. ORACLE_OCM) within the Oracle database, a configured and enabled database vault is also needed."
