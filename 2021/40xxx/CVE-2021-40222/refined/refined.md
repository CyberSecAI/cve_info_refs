- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web application fails to sanitize user input on the Network TCP/IP configuration page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input sanitization, leading to command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution as root on the device. Attackers can create a backdoor or establish a reverse shell.
- **Attack vectors**: Injecting commands via the Network TCP/IP configuration page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Admin access to the device's management interface with a valid or hijacked session.
