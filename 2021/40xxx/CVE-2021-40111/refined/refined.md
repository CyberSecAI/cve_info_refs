- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Crafted APPEND and STATUS IMAP commands can trigger infinite loops in the IMAP parsing stack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Infinite loop leading to excessive CPU consumption and OutOfMemory exceptions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of Service (DoS) attack
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted APPEND and STATUS IMAP commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated IMAP user.
