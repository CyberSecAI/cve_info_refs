{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the web-based configuration management interface of Auerswald COMfortel IP desktop phones. The application fails to properly handle relative path traversal using '/about/../' allowing access to restricted API endpoints without authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Authentication Bypass",
      "Path Traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, including login credentials used for authentication at the PBX. Attackers can then authenticate as the respective phone at the PBX and potentially perform malicious actions such as calling premium rate numbers or intercepting phone calls.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the web-based management interface on port 80. By inserting the prefix '/about/../' before the target API endpoint, the authentication check can be bypassed.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device on the network. No prior authentication is needed."
