The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in ZZCMS2021.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `admin/bad.php` file where user-controlled input (`$_POST['id']`) is concatenated into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. Specifically, the code iterates through the `id` array, concatenating the values with commas into a string `$id`, which is then directly embedded in the `IN` clause of a SQL `DELETE` or `UPDATE` statement.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The lack of proper input sanitization on the `id` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete database compromise.
- Information disclosure: As demonstrated in the provided SQLmap examples, attackers can retrieve sensitive information like user passwords from the database.
- Data deletion: An attacker can use the `del` action to delete data from the `zzcms_bad` table.
- Data modification: An attacker can use the `lockip` action to modify data in the `zzcms_bad` table.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `admin/bad.php` with a crafted `id` parameter within the POST data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to access the vulnerable `admin/bad.php` page. This typically requires gaining access to the administrator user credentials.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target application.

The provided content includes a detailed proof of concept (PoC), demonstrating how to exploit this vulnerability using a crafted HTTP POST request and also showing how to use SQLMap to automate the exploit and retrieve data from the database. The content also provides screenshots demonstrating the exploitation.
