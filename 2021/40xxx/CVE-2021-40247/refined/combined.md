### [Monthly fee/income suggestion](/comment/95532#comment-95532)

Great work Oretnom! It seems to work perfectly and does exactly what it needs to. I do have one question/suggestion. Would it be possible to add something like a Monthly Fee that automatically gets deducted from a specific budget?

Maybe with a checkbox on the expense management page where you can check "This is a monthly fee" or something along those lines. Same with things like income and saving accounts, those are (usually) static too. Either way, it works great ^^

### [Incomplete setup instructions](/comment/102127#comment-102127)

expense\_budget\_db needs its own username and password as most people will NOT have a root user without password defined. Had to update initialize.php with the actual values that I defined for the database. Before doing this your app just returned a blank page and logged a 500 error in the web server log.
