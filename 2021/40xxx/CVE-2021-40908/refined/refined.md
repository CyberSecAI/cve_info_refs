The provided content relates to CVE-2021-40908.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `username` parameter within the `login()` function of the `Login.php` file of the Purchase Order Management System (POMS-PHP) v1.0. This allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the `username` parameter of the login form.
- Lack of input sanitization and escaping of user-supplied data before using it in a SQL query.
- Vulnerable `PHP` code:
  ```php
  $qry = $this->conn->query("SELECT * from users where username = '$username' and password = md5('$password') ");
  ```

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful SQL injection allows an attacker to bypass the login authentication and gain unauthorized access to the admin account.
- Complete control over the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted SQL payload through the login form's username field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the login page of the vulnerable application.
- The attacker must have knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
- The attacker can use a browser-based attack tool or a custom script to perform the attack.
