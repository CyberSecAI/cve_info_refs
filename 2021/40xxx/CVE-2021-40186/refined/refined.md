Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-40186

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the DNN CMS platform's `FileUploadController` which allows users to upload profile pictures either by uploading an image file or providing a URL to an image. When a URL is provided, the system downloads the image. The flaw is that the system uses `HttpWebRequest` which follows HTTP redirects without validating the final URL, enabling an attacker to redirect the download process to an arbitrary URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary vulnerability is SSRF, where the server can be tricked into making requests to arbitrary URLs on behalf of the attacker.
*   **Lack of URL Validation:** The system does not validate the final URL after redirects, allowing the attacker to redirect the request to internal or external servers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Access to Internal Systems:** Attackers can potentially access internal, restricted systems that are normally behind the firewall, such as admin interfaces, intranet servers, and other HTTP interfaces.
*   **Cloud Metadata Service Access:** Attackers may be able to access cloud metadata services (e.g., AWS metadata), potentially exposing sensitive information like API keys and configuration data.
*   **Protocol Emulation:** It may be possible to emulate other protocols by exploiting URI schemes and legacy protocols (e.g., Gopher), depending on the client used by the server for the connection.
*   **Arbitrary File Download:** The server can be coerced into downloading arbitrary content to local files by manipulating the redirected URL.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Profile Image Upload:** The vulnerability is exposed through the profile image upload feature, specifically via the "From URL" option.
*   **HTTP Redirects:** The attacker crafts a URL that initially appears to be an image but redirects to a target of their choice.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Registered User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the DNN CMS platform to access the profile edit page.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP request to the vulnerable DNN instance.
*   **Ability to Host a Redirector:** The attacker requires a host that can perform redirects. The provided example uses `sentineldnnpoc.ptst.io`, but any HTTP server capable of redirects is sufficient.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability resides in the `DNN PlatformDotNetNuke.WebInternalServicesFileUploadController.cs` file.
*   The code uses `HttpWebRequest` to download the image from the URL provided by the user.
*   The `VerifySafeUrl` function only validates the initial URL, not the final one after redirects.
*   The attacker can use a special endpoint that redirects to a base64 encoded URL contained within the path. For example, an initial URL like `https://ptst.io/redir_to_path/aHR0cHM6Ly9hcHBjaGVjay1uZy5jb20v/avatar.png` will redirect to `https://appcheck-ng.com/` after the initial request.

**Mitigation:**
*   Disable image uploads for all users except trusted users.
*   Limit HTTP services accessible from the DNN server via firewall rules.
*   Ensure cloud metadata services are not accessible from the affected DNN host.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vendor was informed of this vulnerability in August 2021, but as of the publication of the content, no official fix has been released.
*   AppCheck's vulnerability scanner can automatically detect this issue.
