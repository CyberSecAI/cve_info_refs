  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The theme upload function in PHPFusion allows uploading of ZIP files containing PHP code, which is then extracted to the webroot.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted file upload",
      "Arbitrary file extraction",
      "Lack of input validation",
        "Direct access to files"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary PHP code execution, leading to complete compromise of the web server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Upload a malicious ZIP file via the theme manager in the admin panel.",
        "Access the uploaded PHP file via HTTP request to execute arbitrary code."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": [
      "Administrative access to the PHPFusion application."
    ],
     "additional_information": "The issue is similar to CVE-2019-11631, which also involves arbitrary code execution through file uploads. The fix was to disable the theme upload functionality. The attacker can insert malicious php code or php file into zip file and upload to server. The function will extract that file to 'webroot/themes/[Theme Folder]', the attacker can access and execute arbitrary code."
