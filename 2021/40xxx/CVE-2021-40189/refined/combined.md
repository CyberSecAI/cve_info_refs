| Man. It's fuc\* theme that must contains php.  Fix is simple, disable this upload function in Theme manager but there are users that uses it.. // removed after discussion with Fred  Also if you have access to administration you can run php from multiple places.. |

| Any scripts in admin panel vulnerabilities caused by Administrator itself is not covered. You must as well give him Shell Access to your server and claim the whole software is vulnerable. |
