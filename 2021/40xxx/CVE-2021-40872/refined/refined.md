Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-40872:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper input validation within the Softing uaToolkit Embedded Server Component. Specifically, the issue occurs due to an invalid type cast when processing specially crafted messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation:** The software fails to properly validate input messages, leading to a type-casting error. This vulnerability also allows anonymous user login which bypasses security checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Remote attackers can cause the server process to crash unexpectedly by sending crafted messages. The affected server component needs to be restarted, disrupting the services it provides.
- **Bypassing Security Checks:** An attacker can login as an anonymous user, bypassing security checks put in place to protect the service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network by sending malicious messages to the OPC/UA server.
- Anonymous login can be used by any user without the need for a password or user account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers require network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of OPC/UA messages:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to craft malicious messages that trigger the type-casting error, or the ability to log in anonymously.
- **No User Credentials Required:** The attack can be performed without requiring user login or privileges, also anonymous login to the service can be performed by any user.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 (High).
- Affected products include:
    - uaToolkit Embedded (all versions up to 1.31). Fixed in version 1.40.
    - smartLink HW-DP (all versions from 1.10). Fix planned for version 1.19.
- The vulnerability is not publicly disclosed nor has it been exploited
