Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-40390

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of hardcoded credentials in an undocumented service within the Moxa MXView Series software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The service listening on port 4430 uses the hardcoded credentials `admin:moxa` for authentication.
*   **Lack of Password Change Mechanism:** There is no documented or apparent way to change or disable access using these credentials for the service on port 4430.
*   **Credential Separation Issue:** Changing the admin user's password via other interfaces (e.g., web application on ports 80/443) does not affect the hardcoded password for the service on port 4430. This creates separate authentication contexts that are not synchronized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized administrator access to the MXView application's functionality by logging in to the service on port 4430 with the hardcoded credentials.
*   **Full System Control:** Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to configure, monitor, and diagnose devices managed by MXView.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker with network access to the vulnerable MXView instance can send an HTTP request to the service listening on port 4430.
*   **Direct Authentication:** The vulnerability requires direct authentication to the service using the hardcoded credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be on the network or have access to the network where the vulnerable MXView server is running.
*   **Knowledge of Credentials:** The attacker must know the hardcoded credentials `admin:moxa` to authenticate to the service on port 4430.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Request:** The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP request to the vulnerable service on port 4430.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable service is referred to as the "polling engine port" during installation and listens on port 4430.
*   The vulnerability affects Moxa MXView Series version 3.2.4.
*   The CVSS v3 score is 10.0, indicating a critical severity.
