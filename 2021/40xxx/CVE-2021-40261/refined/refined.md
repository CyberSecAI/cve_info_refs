- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not sanitize user-supplied input before storing it into the database. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into various database fields. Subsequently, when the data is retrieved from the database and displayed on web pages, the stored XSS payload is executed in the user's browser.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code which can be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various attacks including session hijacking, defacement of the website, phishing, stealing user credentials or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the application's forms. The attacker injects malicious code into input fields which then gets stored into the database. When pages display data from database, the malicious code is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to submit data via the application's forms. No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
