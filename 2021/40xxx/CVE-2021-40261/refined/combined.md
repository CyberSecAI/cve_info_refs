4. Cross site scripting in CASAP Automated Enrollment System v1.0

# Cross site scripting in CASAP Automated Enrollment System v1.0

## Cross site scripting in CASAP Automated Enrollment System v1.0 [Heading link](#cross-site-scripting-in-casap-automated-enrollment-system-v1-0) xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"? Copy link

Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities are present in CASAP Automated Enrollment System v1.0. The following is detailed information about these vulnerabilities:

Following  (table\_name -> property) are prone to stored XSS because application code do not sanitise the value before storing into database.

activity\_log -> username

activity\_log -> action

aprjun -> class

class -> class\_name

class -> category

janmar -> class

Julsep -> class

octdec -> class

Students -> Firstname

Students -> Middlename

Students -> lastname

Students -> address

Students -> class

Students -> gfirstname

Students -> gmiddlename

Students -> glastname

Students -> rship

Students -> status

Students -> transport

Students -> route

users -> username

users -> password

users -> firstname

users -> lastname

users -> status

Attacker can insert malicious input to forms and code allows to store input into database, later resulting into XSS while rendering data from database. Following are the few examples,  of XSS attacks on above mentioned database properties.

File: save\_class.php

Parameters: user\_username, category

This file saves into the db using the unsanitized code. The variables are being plugged into a sql query and stores exploitable data. This is also true for other files in application that saves users, students, and classes.

File: student\_table.php

Parameters: firstname, class, status

Displays the exploitable data from database without any sanitization. All three variables are being displayed in each entry on the table.

File: add\_class1.php

Parameters: category, class\_name

Takes the malicious input from the add\_class.php file and sends it to be stored in the db in save\_class.php. Data is not sanitized while processing the form. Therefore class\_name can be easily used to store JS and catagory can be changed to have malicious values via inspect elements.

File: add\_student.php

Parameters: fname, mname, lname, address, class, gfname, gmname, glname, rship, status, transport, route

Almost every input in this file is can be used to send malicious code into the database and in future, gets executed when a new student is added. All variables listed can store JS value.

File: save\_stud.php

Parameters: fname, mname, lname, address, class, fgname, gmname, glname, rship, status, transport, route

Just like the above examples, the variables are stored into the database without sanitization.

File: add\_user.php

Parameters: status, fname, lname

Similar to students and class as above, the users information can be used to inject malicious code in parameters to execute exploitable code when the tables is displays.

File: users.php

Parameters: username, firstname, status

Renders the malicious data from database without sanitization.

File: save\_user.php

Parameters: fname, lname, status

Similar to above examples, file allows to store unsanitized data into database.

Above vulnerabilities are published at [CVE-2021-40261](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-40261)

This vulnerability was detected as part of the [DARPA CHESS program](https://www.darpa.mil/program/computers-and-humans-exploring-software-security)
