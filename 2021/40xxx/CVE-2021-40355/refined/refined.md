- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application contains an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), allows an attacker to use user-supplied input to access objects directly.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can gain unauthorized access to objects, potentially leading to unauthorized disclosure of information, modification of data, and disruption of service (C:H/I:H/A:H).
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based (AV:N). The attacker needs to send malicious requests using user-supplied input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires high privileges (PR:H) and does not require user interaction (UI:N) to exploit the vulnerability. The attack is not complex (AC:L).
