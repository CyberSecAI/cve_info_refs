有兴趣请帮点一下Star，谢谢支持。
1、本项目为JFinalOA项目，使用jfinal开发、spring版本为点狮项目。
<br/>
2、JFinalOA为全开源版本。点狮完整源代码请联系管理员。
<br/>
3、点狮使用若依前后端分离版本开发
<br/>
4、点狮各个模块体验地址

### JFinalOA项目介绍
<a href="https://blog.csdn.net/qq\_30739519/article/details/82493456" target="\_blank">
最新版已从Activiti升级为Flowable（点击查看Activiti与Flowable区别）
</a>
<br/><br/>
\*\*（QQ群满了，大家有问题加微信吧，个人微信号：yigexiaochengxuyuan QQ:439635374）\*\*
演示项目中有很多审批流的业务为自己开发使用仅供参考（不方便开源），开源项目中仅提供公章使用申请作为示例代码，其他基础功能全部开源，望知晓。

1. JDK请使用1.8（flowable要求）
2. 数据库如果导入失败，请使用mysql5.6+navicat还原psc文件
3. 启动项目如果出现一套大写的ACT开头的数据库表，请将大写表删除之后，设置数据库忽略大小写，重新启动项目
\*\*1.简单介绍\*\*
项目主要提供办公系统的开发人员提供一套带有基本系统管理以及流程管理的开发平台，为办公常用申请部分解决方案。可快速开发办公常用的各类流程功能。
选用的技术框架基本都是简单易上手的，方便自己用来做办公类项目，以及其他类型小项目都会比较方便。
\*\*2.如何运行\*\*
1. 克隆项目之后，导入项目到eclipse。
2. 执行maven update project下载jar包。
3. 配置maven run config使用命令tomcat7:run运行。
4. 或者添加tomcat server将项目部署到tomcat运行。

#### The Open Source Evaluation Index is derived from the OSS Compass evaluation system, which evaluates projects around the following three dimensions

1. Open source ecosystem

* Productivity: To evaluate the ability of open-source projects to output software artifacts and open-source value.
* Innovation: Used to evaluate the degree of diversity of open source software and its ecosystem.
* Robustness: Used to evaluate the ability of open-source projects to resist internal and external interference and self recover in the face of changing development environments.

2. Collaboration, People, Software

* Collaboration: represents the degree and depth of collaboration in open source development behavior.
* Observe the influence of core personnel in open source projects, and examine the evaluations of users and developers on open source projects from a third-party perspective.
* Software: Evaluate the value of products exported from open-source projects and their ultimate destination. It is also a concrete manifestation of "open source software", one of the oldest mainstream directions in open source evaluation.

3. Evaluation model

Based on the dimensions of "open source ecosystem" and "collaboration, people, and software", identify quantifiable indicators directly or indirectly related to this goal, quantitatively evaluate the health and ecology of open source projects, and ultimately form an open source evaluation index.

The vulnerability was discovered by downloading the program's source code to local and online deployment tests.
Location: src/main/java/com/pointlion/mvc/admin/oa/workflow/WorkFlowService.java
Code： String sql = "FROM "+tableName+" o, ( SELECT DISTINCT p.BUSINESS\_KEY\_, d.ID\_ defid FROM act\_hi\_taskinst t, act\_hi\_procinst p, act\_re\_procdef d WHERE t.ASSIGNEE\_='"+username+"' AND p.PROC\_DEF\_ID\_ = d.ID\_ AND d.KEY\_ = '"+defkey+"' AND t.END\_TIME\_ is not NULL AND t.PROC\_INST\_ID\_ = p.ID\_) tt WHERE tt.BUSINESS\_KEY\_ = o.id ";// String sql = " from "+tableName+" o , (select BUSINESS\_KEY\_,d.ID\_ defid from act\_hi\_identitylink i,act\_hi\_procinst p,act\_re\_procdef d where i.TYPE\_='participant' and p.ID\_=i.PROC\_INST\_ID\_ and p.PROC\_DEF\_ID\_=d.ID\_ and d.KEY\_='"+defkey+"' and i.USER\_ID\_='"+username+"') tt where tt.BUSINESS\_KEY\_=o.id"; if(StrKit.notBlank(sqlEXT)){ sql = sql + sqlEXT; } sql = sql +" order by o.create\_time desc"; return Db.paginate(pnum, psize, " select o.\*,defid ", sql);Rows:409
Harm： The attacker only needs an ordinary user to trigger the vulnerability and use the SQL injection vulnerability to obtain database information.
Conditions for Execution： There is an unauthorized vulnerability in the getHaveDoneTaskDataList method of FlowTaskController. In this method, only the login status is obtained, and the user is not authenticated. Therefore, the unauthorized vulnerability can be used in combination. Although it is a background function, this injection can be used by ordinary users.
Edition： Version = all
Cause the cause ： Use the splicing method to splice the parameter'"+defkey+"' in the sql query statement, and then bring the sql statement into the database for execution, and the vulnerability is triggered.
POC：According to the framework routing configuration combined with the controller method to construct the url/admin/oa/workflow/flowtask/getHaveDoneTaskDataList?pageNumber=&pageSize=&defkey=Payload:1' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 --+Taking into account the need to log in, so use burpsuite to capture the package and save it to txt and then use sqlmap to testsqlmap.py -r D:\test.txt --random-agent --dbs --current-db
