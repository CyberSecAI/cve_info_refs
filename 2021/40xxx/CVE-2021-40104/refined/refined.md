- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from an insecure SVG sanitizer. The core SVG sanitizer was bypassed, leading to potential security issues.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is an SVG sanitizer bypass. The previous sanitizer was inadequate in preventing malicious code within SVG files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious code into SVG files, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) or other malicious actions if the SVG files are processed by the application.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to upload a specially crafted SVG file that bypasses the sanitization process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to upload SVG files to the application.

The provided content gives details about the fix. The core SVG sanitizer was replaced by a third-party library, darylldoyle/svg-sanitizer to properly sanitize SVG files. This indicates a lack of proper sanitization in the original code.
