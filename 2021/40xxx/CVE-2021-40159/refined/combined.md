## Autodesk Inventor JT File Parsing Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-22-282ZDI-CAN-15671

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-40159](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-40159) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | Autodesk |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Inventor |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Autodesk Inventor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JT files. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Autodesk has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2021-10-29 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2022-02-10 - Coordinated public release of advisory |

## Autodesk Inventor JT File Parsing Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-22-289ZDI-CAN-15668

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-40159](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-40159) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | Autodesk |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Inventor |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Autodesk Inventor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JT files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Autodesk has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

### Recommendations

Autodesk highly recommends that customers download and install the latest version of Autodesk® Inventor 2022 Update 2 (version 2022.2), which is available via the Autodesk Desktop App or the [Accounts Portal](https://manage.autodesk.com/). This version of Autodesk Inventor includes security updates that address the JT file vulnerabilities. As a general best practice, we recommend that customers only open JT files from trusted sources and update to the latest software version.

Updates are not available for previously supported versions of Autodesk® Inventor and AutoCAD® – versions 2021-2019. Mitigation instructions for Autodesk® Inventor 2021-2019 are available in this[Autodesk Knowledge Network](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fknowledge.autodesk.com%2Farticle%2FSECURITY-ADVISORY-Applications-and-Services-that-utilize-Autodesk-Inventor-may-be-affected-by-Out-of-bounds-Read-and-Information-disclosure-vulnerabilities&data=04%7C01%7Cayesha.khan%40autodesk.com%7C1a5b4ab412a8498ef8ed08d9b9a6f79a%7C67bff79e7f914433a8e5c9252d2ddc1d%7C0%7C0%7C637744949026581376%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=CxbLrh4ZW7fJ2BQX9kU%2Bwcj9vmBxAzpalXppM1TvyEo%3D&reserved=0)article and for Autodesk AutoCAD-based products in this[Autodesk Knowledge Network](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/article/JT-Vulnerabilities-in-AutoCAD-based-products)article. In addition, users of the 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 versions of Autodesk® Advance Steel, Autodesk® Civil 3D, AutoCAD®, AutoCAD® LT, and AutoCAD-based specialized toolsets listed in the table above should install the latest AutoCAD® or AutoCAD LT 2022 or 2023 updates, as applicable, via the Autodesk Desktop App or[Accounts Portal](https://manage.autodesk.com/).

Customers using previous versions that no longer qualify for full support should plan to upgrade to a supported version as soon as possible to avoid downtime and potential security vulnerabilities. Visit the [Autodesk Knowledge Network](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/customer-service/account-management/users-software/previous-versions) for more information about previous version support.
