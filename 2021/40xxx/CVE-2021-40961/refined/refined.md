Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-40961:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the CMS Made Simple software, specifically in the `News` module.
- The `sortby` parameter within the `modules/News/function.admin_articlestab.php` file is vulnerable.
- Although the application attempts to sanitize the `sortby` parameter by replacing single quotes (`'`) with underscores (`_`), it's still possible to inject arbitrary SQL code without using single quotes in the `ORDER BY` clause.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The application concatenates a user-controlled input (`sortby` parameter) directly into a SQL query without proper sanitization, leading to the injection of malicious SQL code.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The sanitization performed is inadequate, as it only addresses single quotes and does not prevent other forms of SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability. This could include usernames, password hashes, and other potentially sensitive data.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By extracting the username of an administrator, an attacker can trigger a password reset. The reset token can then also be extracted through the same SQL injection, allowing the attacker to reset the administrator's password and gain administrative access to the CMS.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** After gaining administrative access, an attacker can leverage a separate vulnerability (CVE-2018-10086) to achieve remote code execution on the server. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `m1_sortby` POST parameter of the News module, accessible via `moduleinterface.php`.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated user with low privileges, not requiring administrative credentials to initiate the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the CMS Made Simple platform, even a user with low privileges can exploit the SQL injection.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `m1_sortby` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Ability to Craft SQL Payloads:** The attacker needs the ability to construct valid SQL injection payloads that can extract information from the database, bypass the application's minimal sanitization, and force the database to return errors using techniques such as time-based or boolean-based attacks.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content details how an attacker can use time-based SQL injection using the `sleep()` function. However, it also demonstrates how to use a more efficient method using the `pow()` function to cause an overflow error, leading to a blind boolean injection technique. This method is used to extract the username and then the password reset token from the database.
- The exploit chain combines this SQL injection vulnerability with CVE-2018-10086 (a known RCE vulnerability in CMS Made Simple) to achieve complete system compromise.
- The provided blog post includes a Python script to automate the full exploitation process from SQL injection to RCE, and provides a video demonstrating the attack.
- The vendor was informed of the vulnerability, but stated they would not fix the issue.

In summary, CVE-2021-40961 is a SQL injection vulnerability that allows for information disclosure, privilege escalation, and ultimately leads to remote code execution. It is exploitable by authenticated low-privileged users, making it a serious security flaw. The detailed analysis provides technical insights into exploiting the vulnerability beyond the basic description.
