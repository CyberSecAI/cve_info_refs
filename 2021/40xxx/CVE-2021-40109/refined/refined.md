- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The application was vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to a lack of proper validation and handling of URLs during file uploads. Specifically, the application was following redirects, and not implementing sufficient URL/IP protections.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SSRF vulnerability due to insufficient URL validation and lack of redirect disabling during file uploads.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially make the server initiate requests to internal or external resources, leading to information disclosure, access to internal services, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting malicious URLs during the file upload process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to upload files or control the file upload process to inject malicious URLs.

The provided content gives more detail than the CVE description. It details the specific actions taken to remediate the SSRF vulnerability:
    - Disabling redirects on upload
    - Adding an http client method to send requests without following redirects
    - Implementing URL/IP protections (e.g., blocking big Endian URLs, blocking IP variants, preventing importing from hexadecimal/octal/long IPs).
