Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-40375:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper access control implementation in OpenEyes 3.5.1. Although the application returns a "Forbidden" message on the webpage when a low-privileged user attempts to access a patient profile, the server still returns all the patient's information in the response.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The application fails to properly restrict access to sensitive patient data based on user privileges. The server provides the data regardless of the "Forbidden" message displayed on the user interface.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Sensitive patient information is included in the server response, even when access should be denied. This information is accessible by viewing the page source or through an intercepting proxy.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Confidentiality breach:** Unauthorized low-privileged users can access sensitive patient information, violating patient privacy and confidentiality.
*   **Exposure of PII and medical data:** The exposed information includes personally identifiable information (PII) like Date of Birth, NHS number, and address, as well as extensive medical information such as medication plans, prescription details, appointment history, medical problems, and past procedures.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Direct URL manipulation:** An attacker can obtain a valid patient profile URL (e.g. from a legitimate user), log in with a low-privileged account and use the URL to request the patient information.
*   **Page source inspection:** After accessing the URL with insufficient privilege, the attacker can view the full patient details in the page source despite the 'Forbidden' message on screen.
*   **Intercepting proxies:** An attacker could use an intercepting proxy to view the full response returned from the server, including the sensitive information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs a low-privileged user account in the OpenEyes application.
*   The attacker needs access to a valid patient profile URL. This URL could be obtained through social engineering or by observing a high privileged user accessing the application.
*   The attacker should be able to use tools like "view page source" in browser or an intercepting proxy to access the returned information.

**Additional Notes**

* The provided Github repository contains a proof-of-concept of this vulnerability and further details.
* The OpenEyes application is used in several healthcare organisations across UK, making this a potentially high-impact vulnerability.
