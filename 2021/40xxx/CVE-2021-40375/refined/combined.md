# CVE-2021-40375 - Broken Access Control in OpenEyes 3.5.1

## Description

An improper access control vulnerability was identified in OpenEyes 3.5.1, developed by the Apperta Foundation.

A low privileged user could load a patient's profile in their browser and access sensitive information without the required level of privilege. Despite the application returning a 'Forbidden' message on the webpage, the server response still returned all the information about a patient. This information could be viewed in an intercepting proxy, or simply by viewing the page source within the browser.

## Reproduction

1. As a highly privileged user, view a patient profile.
2. Copy the URL to this patient profile.
3. Log out of the OpenEyes session.
4. Log in with a low privileged user.
5. Paste the patient profile URL in and browse to this.
6. Note that OpenEyes returns a 'Foribidden' message.
7. Right click and click 'View page source'.
8. Note that the sensitive patient information is still returned in the response, and can be viewed in the page source.

## Impact

The patient overview contains sensitive information about the patient. This includes PII such as Date of Birth, NHS number and address. In addition, extensive medical information is disclosed such as medication plans, prescription informations, past appointments, current medical problems or past procdeures.

This information being obtained by a user who is unauthorized could result in a breache of privacy, and impact the confidentiality of patient information stored within the OpenEyes application.

OpenEyes is the leading open source electronic patient record (EPR) for ophthalmology. It has been designed by clinicians to be fast in delivering content, fast to navigate and easy (and fun) to use. We benefit from a large and growing body of enthusiastic clinicians determined to make OpenEyes the EPR that will help you deliver data-driven patient care in the best way possible. OpenEyes is owned by the community and not by any individual or corporate entity. It can be customised to suit local needs and will scale to connect, seamlessly, primary and secondary eye care.

## OpenEyes the leading open source EPR for Ophthalmology

---

OpenEyes is an electronic patient record application for ophthalmology, developed with contributions from a range of hospitals, institutions, academic departments, companies and individuals. Intuitive to use and fast, it runs in a web browser to ensure that it can be accessed from just about any device in any location. OpenEyes will always be available free-of-charge under an open source license, making it a cost-effective option for eye care, and, perhaps more importantly, ensuring that its development will always prioritise what clincians really need.

While OpenEyes can be downloaded and used free of charge anywhere in the world, we recommend that installations in a clinical environment are handled through our authorised professional services network. One of our professional services partners ToukanLabs, can provide advice and pricing on accredited implementation and support services.

Our partners will ensure that your clinical data integrates with hospital workflows and PAS system and that the connections to devices such as OCT machines or visual field devices are robust.

All users of OpenEyes can become members of our development community, participating in online and offline discussions to identify and prioritise the OpenEyes development roadmap. To learn more about membership, please call 0300 030 1973 or email us at openeyes@apperta.org  and for a more detailed look at OpenEyes, click the button below.

* Prioritise and commission OpenEyes development
* As copyright and IP owner, publishing the source code
* Growing the accredited professional services partner network
* Assuring OpenEyes for DCB0129 compliance

Continuing this development as a not for profit body is an essential part of our collaborative, public service ethos. OpenEyes cannot, in itself, be sold to a third party ensuring that users have security and can influence development. The OpenEyes community manage the design and development of future versions of OpenEyes in response to feedback.
