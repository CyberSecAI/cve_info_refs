Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-40099:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stemmed from fetching the update JSON scheme from concrete5 over HTTP instead of HTTPS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure communication protocol (HTTP) for fetching update information. This allowed for a potential man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). A malicious actor could potentially manipulate the update JSON fetched over HTTP to include malicious updates and execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack during the fetching of the update JSON.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the Concrete CMS instance and the server providing the update JSON. This could involve network-level access or control.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix was implemented by making the update JSON fetch over HTTPS.
- The vulnerability was reported through Hackerone (report 982130).
