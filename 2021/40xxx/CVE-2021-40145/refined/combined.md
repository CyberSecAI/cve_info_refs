| Hello,  I found that 'gdImageGdPtr' in gd\_gd.c and 'gdImageWebpPtr' in gd\_webp.c are similar functions for different picture formats. You have changed 'gdImageWebpPtr' because of [CVE-2016-6912](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wmff-45hx-q83q "CVE-2016-6912") (double free), So It seems that you need to change 'gdImageGdPtr' too. I run two test files with ASAN, and the result is shown below. The test files are located in the 'tests/webp' folder.  Test1:  ``` #include "gd.h" #include "gdtest.h"   int main() { gdImagePtr im1, im2; int size;  im1 = NULL; im2 = gdImageGdPtr(im1, &size); gdTestAssert(im2 == NULL);  gdImageDestroy(im1);  return gdNumFailures(); }  ```  ASAN result:  ``` AddressSanitizer:DEADLYSIGNAL ================================================================= ==4303==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address 0x000000001c50 (pc 0x7f368bd976d8 bp 0x7ffd77fc7d70 sp 0x7ffd77fc7d60 T0) ==4303==The signal is caused by a READ memory access. #0 0x7f368bd976d7 in _gdPutHeader /libgd/src/gd_gd.c:353 #1 0x7f368bd977d6 in _gdImageGd /libgd/src/gd_gd.c:370 #2 0x7f368bd97aec in gdImageGdPtr /libgd/src/gd_gd.c:403 #3 0x557763c46493 in main /libgd/tests/webp/gd_mytest.c:12 #4 0x7f368b68309a in __libc_start_main ../csu/libc-start.c:308 #5 0x557763c46339 in _start (/libgd/build/Bin/test_webp_gd_mytest+0x2339)  AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.

| The first test script is bogus, since ìm1`is not initialized. The second test script does not`gdImageDestroy(im2)` which apperars to be the cause of the memory leak.  Anyhow, this is not related to [CVE-2016-6912](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wmff-45hx-q83q "CVE-2016-6912"), because that was about a double-free in case `gdImageWebpCtx()` failed, but `_gdImageGd()` cannot fail. |

| Sorry I had a typo in test 1 and `im1 = NULL;` but there is no check for this exception in `_gdImageGd`.  You are using some conditional checks in `_gdImageWebpCtx` and then return 0 or one based on that to prevent double free and other problems. why don't you use such similar conditions in `_gdImageGd` too?  the second test is the test file you are using [here](https://github.com/libgd/libgd/blob/master/tests/webp/bug_double_free.c) with a little change that I replace `gdImageWebpPtr` with `gdImageGdPtr`. when I added gdImageDestroy(im2) the result is here.  ``` /libgd/tests/webp/gd_mytest.c:21: Assert failed in </libgd/tests/webp/gd_mytest.c:21> AddressSanitizer:DEADLYSIGNAL ================================================================= ==4659==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address 0x000000000000 (pc 0x7fefd9b0a9fb bp 0x7ffcb9b0f7c0 sp 0x7ffcb9b0f7a0 T0) ==4659==The signal is caused by a READ memory access. ==4659==Hint: address points to the zero page.     #0 0x7fefd9b0a9fa in gdImageDestroy /libgd/src/gd.c:392     #1 0x563ab073556b in main /libgd/tests/webp/gd_mytest.c:24     #2 0x7fefd942009a in __libc_start_main ../csu/libc-start.c:308     #3 0x563ab0735349 in _start (/libgd/build/Bin/test_webp_gd_mytest+0x2349)  AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.

| if you pass garbage to libgd, you can only expect garbage back. it is not gd's responsibility to make sure programmers don't pass it garbage. that includes, but is not limited to, programmers passing in NULL pointers.  gd guarantees that failures coming from the OS are handled gracefully when possible, as are corrupt input files/images. |

| "some places check for NULL" is not the same thing as "gd guarantees you can pass it NULL pointers". if you have code passing NULL pointers to functions, your code is bad and needs fixing. it is not a bug in gd.  we should be able to add non-null attributes to our functions so the compiler could try and enforce that too. |

| It seems to me a very typical issue is to get `NULL` from calling an image creation function (e.g. due to wrong image format). And this *needs* to be handled by the libgd client.  libwebp may fail to encode an image, and this also *needs* to be handled by the client; in this case libgd is the client.  The only reason `_gdImageGd()` may fail is due to one of the memory allocation functions failing (i.e. out of memory); this is indeed not cleanly handled by libgd (for a start, all putter functions in gd\_io.c would need to report sucess/failure). However, this is not really an issue for me, since I mainly work with an infallible allocator. |

| Hi, Similar to the previous discussion, function `_gdImageGd2` which is called in gdImageGd2Ptr in gd\_gd2.c there is no return value to show fail in `_gdImageGd2` and no return value check in `gdImageGd2Ptr`.  despite of `_gdImageGd()`, There are some conditions in `_gdImageGd2` which lead it to `fail1`. So if it goes through these fail situations it means that `out` isn't allocated correctly and calling the `gdDPExtractData` leads to double free.  Isn't it necessary to add success and fail return value to `_gdImageGd2`? |

| Isn't it necessary to add success and fail return value to \_gdImageGd2?  Oh, right. Stll, not a security issue, since it [is documented](https://libgd.github.io/manuals/2.3.1/files/gd_gd2-c.html):  It has to be regarded as being obsolete, and should only be used for development and testing purposes. |

### @meweez **[meweez](/meweez)** commented [Jul 19, 2021](#issue-947710496)

We discussed it in issue [#700](https://github.com/libgd/libgd/issues/700).

There are some conditions in `_gdImageGd2` which lead it to fail1. So if it goes through these fail situations it means that the `out` isn't allocated correctly and calling the gdDPExtractData leads to double free.

so I add return value to `_gdImageGd2` and checked it in `gdImageGd2Ptr`.

Sorry, something went wrong.
