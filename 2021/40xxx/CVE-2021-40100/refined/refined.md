- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stored XSS vulnerability in the Conversations feature when the Active Conversation Editor is set to "Rich Text".
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into conversations, which can then be executed in the context of other users' browsers who view the conversation. This could lead to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed by injecting malicious code into conversation input fields, which is stored and later rendered when other users view the conversation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to post a conversation message where the editor is set to "Rich Text". The vulnerability affects both client and admin side conversations.
