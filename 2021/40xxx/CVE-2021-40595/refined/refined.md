Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `login()` function within the `Login.php` file of the Online Leave Management System. Specifically, the `username` parameter from the login form is directly injected into a SQL query without any form of escaping or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly incorporates the user-supplied username into a SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Bypass Authentication:** By injecting SQL code, an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism, gaining unauthorized access to the system.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not sanitize or escape special characters or malicious payloads within the username input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can bypass the login and gain access to the admin account.
- **Data Breach:** Once logged in, the attacker could access sensitive employee data, leave records, and system settings.
- **System Compromise:** Depending on the database user privileges, the attacker could modify or delete data, potentially leading to further system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Login Form:** The attack vector is the login form of the Online Leave Management System.
- **Malicious Input:** An attacker would supply malicious SQL code within the `username` field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the login form of the web application.
- **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft a malicious query.

**Technical Details**

The vulnerable code snippet is:

```php
$qry = $this->conn->query("SELECT * from users where username = '$username' and password = md5('$password') ");
```
The provided "fix" is:
```php
$qry = $this->conn->query("SELECT * from users where username = ('$username') and password = md5('$password') ");
```
This fix is insufficient, adding parentheses around `$username` does not prevent SQL injection.

The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates bypassing the login using SQL injection.  An attacker can use a payload such as `' or '1'='1` as the username which bypasses the authentication.
