# Online Leave Management System in PHP Free Source Code

 [![](/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/images/oretnom23/admin_employee_record.png?itok=MCHIE_Vb)](/sites/default/files/images/oretnom23/admin_employee_record.png)

I have created a **PHP Project** entitled **Online Employee Leave Management System**. This PHP Project provides the company's management and employees an online platform to manage the leave applications. The application is mobile-responsive which is helpful nowadays because most of the employees owning a personal mobile smartphone. Using this system, the employees can easily apply for leave even they are not present in the office. Also, management can easily track the employees' leave records annually and this application has a feature that prevents the employee to apply if they already consumed their leave credits. Each employee's leave privileges are manageable here which means the management can manage the employee's leave privilege and credits individually. The employees' leave credits are automatically reset annually. This online application also generates a printable date-wise report for leave applications.

## **About the Online Employee Leave Management System**

This web application was developed using **PHP, MySQL Database, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Ajax & jQuery), Bootstrap, AdminLTE Template, and some other libraries/plugins**. I created this project using **[XAMPP](https://apachefriends.org)** version 3.30 and does have a **PHP version of 8.0.7**.

The **Online Employee Leave Management System** is easy to use and has a pleasant user interface. This consists of 3 types of system users which are the **Admin**, **Staff**, and **Employee**. The **Admin User** has access and can manage all the features and functionalities of the system. The **Staff User** has only restricted access to some features and functionalities does the **Admin** has. Lastly, the **Employee User** can only track his/her leave records, manage his/her application, and manage his/her system account/credentials.

Thank you so much for this application. Everything works fine. The only thing I need now is to increase the approval level. Presently, we only have one, but I need it to be two. I.e. in my organization, Head of Department must approve before the Director of Finance and Corporate Services will approve. I will be happy if I can be guided on how to achieve this. Good job sir.

# CVE-nu11-03

## Online Leave Management System SQL-Injection-Bypass-Authentication:

[![](https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/CVE-nu11secur1ty/raw/main/vendors/oretnom23/CVE-nu11-03/Capture.PNG)](https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/CVE-nu11secur1ty/blob/main/vendors/oretnom23/CVE-nu11-03/Capture.PNG)

## Vendor:

### Description:

The OLMS - PHP (by: oretnom23 ) v1.0 is vulnerable in the application /leave\_system/classes/Login.php from remote SQL-Injection-Bypass-Authentication
m0re info: <https://portswigger.net/support/using-sql-injection-to-bypass-authentication>.
The parameter (username) from the login form is not protected correctly and there is no security and escaping from malicious payloads.
When the user will sending a malicious query or malicious payload to the MySQL server he can bypass the login credentials and take control of the administer account.

## Broken query:

```
	public function login(){
		extract($_POST);

		$qry = $this->conn->query("SELECT * from users where username = '$username' and password = md5('$password') ");
		if($qry->num_rows > 0){
			foreach($qry->fetch_array() as $k => $v){
				if(!is_numeric($k) && $k != 'password'){
					$this->settings->set_userdata($k,$v);
				}

			}
```

## The fix, but not strong enough!

```
public function login(){
		extract($_POST);

		$qry = $this->conn->query("SELECT * from users where username = ('$username') and password = md5('$password') ");
		if($qry->num_rows > 0){
			foreach($qry->fetch_array() as $k => $v){
				if(!is_numeric($k) && $k != 'password'){
					$this->settings->set_userdata($k,$v);
				}

			}
```
