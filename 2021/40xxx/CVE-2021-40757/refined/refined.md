- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Access of memory location after end of buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-788), leading to memory corruption
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by user interaction, specifically when opening a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious file that, when opened by a user, triggers the out-of-bounds write. No special privileges or network access are required.
