  "CVE ID": "CVE-2021-40170",
  "Summary": "The provided content describes a master's thesis project where a critical vulnerability was found in the proprietary RF protocol of a SecuritasHome smart home alarm system. This vulnerability allows an attacker to disarm an armed system, completely bypassing its functionality. The thesis focused on radio frequency (RF) hacking against the systems RF communication, discovering the lack of protection against replay attacks, where captured RF signals can be retransmitted to trigger the same action. This is further corroborated by the thesis where it states that every single tested endpoint of the RF communication was deemed vulnerable to replay attacks.",
  "Root cause": "The root cause is the lack of proper security measures in the proprietary RF protocol used by the SecuritasHome alarm system, specifically the absence of protection against replay attacks.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Lack of protection against replay attacks in the RF communication protocol.",
    "Use of a proprietary RF protocol with insufficient security considerations.",
    "No implementation of time-stamps or rolling codes to prevent replay attacks."
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker can disarm an armed system by replaying captured RF signals, gaining unauthorized access to the protected property. Additionally, an attacker can trigger false alarms by replaying tamper sensor signals.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Capturing RF signals using a Software Defined Radio (SDR).",
    "Replaying the captured RF signals using an SDR to disarm the alarm system."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Physical proximity to the system to capture RF signals.",
    "Knowledge of using SDRs to capture and replay RF signals.",
    "Basic technical competence."
  ],
  "Additional details": "The thesis provides more details than the official CVE description. It elaborates on the methods used to identify the vulnerability, including the use of tools like Universal Radio Hacker and the manual demodulation of the RF signals. It further explains the structure of the messages, identifying the preamble, sync word and payload, as well as the fact that the payload seems to be encrypted, though the method is unknown. The thesis also mentions that while capturing signals, it was found that they could be replayed even if they were not captured perfectly, which suggests error correction within the RF communication."
