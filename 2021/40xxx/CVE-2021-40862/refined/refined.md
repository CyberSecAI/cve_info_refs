- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Configuration Versions API in Terraform Enterprise was erroneously exposing sensitive URLs associated with configuration versions in its responses. These URLs contain a securely generated secret used for accessing the internal service where configuration version information is stored.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of sensitive URLs containing secrets. This allows unauthorized access to configuration versions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user with read-only access to a workspace could use the exposed URLs to perform privilege escalation or unauthorized modification of the Terraform configuration associated with a Terraform Enterprise workspace.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via the Configuration Versions API. An attacker with read-only access to a workspace can make API requests to retrieve the sensitive URLs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker requires read-only access to a Terraform Enterprise workspace.
