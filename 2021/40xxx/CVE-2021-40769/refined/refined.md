Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-40769:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read, where the application attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to privilege escalation. Specifically, an attacker could potentially gain elevated privileges on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have access to the targeted system (AV:L).
- The attack does not require specific user privileges, but user interaction is required for the exploit (PR:N, UI:R).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have local access to the system on which the vulnerable application is running.
- The attacker needs to entice a user to interact with the crafted data that triggers the out-of-bounds read, such as opening a malicious file with the vulnerable application.

**CVSS Details**
- CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  - **AV:L** (Local): The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable system.
  - **AC:L** (Low): The attack does not require special conditions to be successful.
  - **PR:N** (None): No privileges are required for an attacker to carry out the attack.
  - **UI:R** (Required): User interaction is needed for the attack to succeed.
  - **S:U** (Unchanged): The vulnerability scope remains within the vulnerable component.
  - **C:L** (Low): The attack results in limited disclosure of information
  - **I:N** (None): There is no impact on data integrity.
  - **A:N** (None): There is no impact on availability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Adobe Character Animator 2021 version 4.4 and earlier on Windows and macOS.
- The fix is available in versions 4.4.2 for Character Animator 2021 and version 22.0 for Character Animator 2022.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as Moderate.
- The vulnerability was reported by Mat Powell working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
