Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-40660:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a regular expression (RegEx) used in the `delight-nashorn-sandbox` library's `JsSanitizer.java` class. This regular expression, designed to inject interruption calls for CPU time monitoring, is susceptible to a ReDoS (Regular expression Denial of Service) attack due to excessive backtracking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **ReDoS Vulnerability:** The complex regular expression `\n(?![\W]*(//.+[\W]+)*else)` is the core weakness. This pattern allows an attacker to craft a malicious input string that causes the regex engine to backtrack excessively, leading to high CPU usage and potentially a denial of service.
- **Inefficient Regex:** The regular expression is not optimized and can lead to exponential time complexity in certain cases, making it vulnerable to ReDoS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By exploiting the ReDoS vulnerability, an attacker can cause a service using `delight-nashorn-sandbox` to become unresponsive due to high CPU consumption, effectively leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** An attacker can inject specially crafted JavaScript code containing a large number of comment lines with a specific structure that triggers the vulnerable regex.
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by providing malicious input to the `delight-nashorn-sandbox`, without needing access to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input:** An attacker needs the ability to provide JavaScript code to the `delight-nashorn-sandbox` for execution. This could be through a web application, API, or any other interface where the sandbox is used.
- **No Special Privileges:** No special privileges are needed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in versions of `delight-nashorn-sandbox` up to and including version 0.2.0.
- The issue was addressed in version 0.3.1 of `delight-nashorn-sandbox`.
- The fix involved introducing a character sequence check to limit match counts during regex matching, along with a hard shutdown of the thread as fallback, and moving comment removal before beautification.
- The vulnerability is tracked as GHSA-38j3-6fm8-pfgc in GitHub's advisory database.
- The identified vulnerable regex is used to inject monitoring code to measure CPU time usage, which includes a check for `else` statements in order to exclude inserting the monitoring code on those lines.
