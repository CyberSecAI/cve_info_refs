Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-40396:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect default permissions assigned during the installation of Advantech DeviceOn/iService 1.1.7. The installation directory ("c:\Program Files\Advantech\WISE-DeviceOn") grants "Full" control permissions to the "Everyone" group over crucial service binaries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Default Permissions:** The primary weakness is the overly permissive file system permissions granted to the "Everyone" group on executable and library files within the installation directory.
- **Unprivileged Service Execution:** The "postgresql" service executes binaries with "NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE" privileges.
- **SeImpersonatePrivilege:** The service is also assigned `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, allowing it to impersonate other users/tokens.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with local access can replace the vulnerable binaries (executables and DLLs) with malicious versions. Upon service restart, the attacker's malicious code executes with "NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE" privileges.
- **NT SYSTEM access:** By abusing `SeImpersonatePrivilege` the attacker can escalate privileges further to "NT SYSTEM", gaining full control over the system.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Full system compromise is possible with the ability to execute arbitrary code with the highest privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the target machine to replace the vulnerable files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Account:** The attacker requires a local user account with the ability to write to the installation directory "c:\Program Files\Advantech\WISE-DeviceOn".
- **File Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to replace the legitimate binaries with malicious ones.
- **Service Restart:** The attacker needs to restart the service to trigger the malicious code execution (which can be done by a local user).
