The provided content contains vulnerability information for **CVE-2021-40424** and **CVE-2021-40425**. The analysis below focuses on the information relevant to **CVE-2021-40424**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of CVE-2021-40424 is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the `GetProcessCommandLine` IOCTL handler of the `WRCore_x64` device driver. Specifically, the driver attempts to read the `hprocess` field from a user-controlled buffer without proper validation, leading to an out-of-bounds read if the buffer does not contain enough data past offset 0x24.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125):** The driver reads memory outside of the allocated buffer boundaries when accessing the `hprocess` field.
- **Insufficient input validation:** The input buffer length check is insufficient to prevent the out-of-bounds read as the check only validates up to 0x18 bytes while the hprocess field is located at offset 0x24, allowing an attacker to supply an undersized buffer that will still pass the length check.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds read leads to a system crash (Blue Screen of Death) due to accessing invalid memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local access:** An attacker needs local access to the system to open a handle to the vulnerable device driver and send a specially crafted IOCTL request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute code on the target system.
- Ability to interact with the device driver by sending IOCTL requests.
