Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE-2021-40860**

*   **Root Cause:** The Genesys iWD Manager's filter functionality, specifically the `ql_expression` parameter, is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user input before being used in SQL queries.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:**  The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection, meaning the attacker doesn't see the results of the injected queries directly in the response. Instead, they use time-based or boolean-based techniques to infer data.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially dump sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, database structure, and other internal data.
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  Attackers can obtain database usernames, hostnames, database names, table names, column names, and content of the tables the exploited user has access to.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter `ql_expression` is sent via an HTTP GET request.
    *   **HTTP POST Request Body (JSON):** Later versions of the software used a POST request with a JSON body, and the vulnerability was still present within the filter expression.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have valid user credentials to access the iWD Manager and its filter functionality.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is described as both boolean-based and time-based blind SQL injection.
*   The impact was limited to data exfiltration and information disclosure, with no apparent ability to insert, update, or delete data or execute operating system commands.
*   The vulnerability was present in iWD versions prior to 9.0.013.11 and between 9.0.013.11 and 9.0.017.07, with different attack vectors in those different versions.

**CVE-2021-40861**

*   **Root Cause:**  Similar to CVE-2021-40860, this CVE addresses the SQL injection vulnerability in newer versions of Genesys iWD Manager after a change in how the filter function is used. The user-defined filter, now part of a JSON object in the request body, was still not sanitized before being used in SQL queries.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:**  The application still incorporates user-supplied input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:**  The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection, similar to previous versions.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Attackers can dump sensitive information from the database.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can obtain database details and user data, similar to CVE-2021-40860.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP POST Request with JSON Body:** The vulnerable expression is passed through a JSON object within an HTTP POST request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authenticated Access:**  The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the iWD Manager.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
*   The vulnerability was present in iWD versions between 9.0.013.11 and 9.0.017.07.

**Mitigation**
*   Genesys released a hotfix version 9.0.018.05 to remediate this vulnerability.
*   It is recommended to update to the latest version of Genesys iWD Manager to address this security vulnerability.
