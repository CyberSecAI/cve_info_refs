{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A floating point exception occurs due to division by zero when `ctx->timescale` is zero, and `sps->vui.time_scale` or `sps->vui.num_units_in_tick` are also zero. The code calculates `ctx->cur_fps.den` which is used for setting the frame rate. If both `sps->vui.time_scale` and `sps->vui.num_units_in_tick` are zero,  `ctx->cur_fps.den` becomes zero which leads to division by zero error.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of zero values leading to division by zero."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service due to a floating-point exception, leading to a crash of the application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted MP4 file that has specific zero values for parameters related to frame rate calculation."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious input file. No special privileges or positions are required."
  },
  "additional_information": {
    "fixes": "The issue was fixed by checking if `sps->vui.time_scale` and `sps->vui.num_units_in_tick` are not zero before performing the division."
