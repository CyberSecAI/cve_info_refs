Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The Checkmk Management Web Console, specifically in versions 1.5.0 to 1.5.0p25, does not properly sanitize input from a web service parameter located in an unauthenticated zone.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS, meaning malicious code is injected through a crafted request and reflected back to the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and client-side scripts (like JavaScript) within the user's browser.
- This can lead to:
  - **Backdoor creation:** Injecting malicious scripts to create a backdoor on the device.
  - **Session hijacking:** Stealing session cookies from authenticated users through a man-in-the-middle attack, potentially gaining unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The primary attack vector is through a crafted web service request to the vulnerable, unauthenticated zone of the Checkmk web console.
- An attacker can inject malicious code through a vulnerable parameter within this web request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network access:** The attacker needs access to the web service resource without needing to authenticate. This means the vulnerable endpoint is publicly accessible or accessible from the attacker's network.
-   **Crafting malicious requests:** The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious HTTP requests that include the XSS payload.

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability affects Checkmk Raw Edition software.
-   The vulnerability was discovered on 2021-09-01.
-   The vulnerability was patched in version 1.6.0p26 and later.
-   The provided GitHub repository includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability in version 1.5.0p25.
