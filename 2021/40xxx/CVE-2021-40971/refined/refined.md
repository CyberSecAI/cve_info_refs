The provided content is related to CVE-2021-40971.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled parameters in the `templates/installer/step-004.inc.php` file. Specifically, the `username`, `newpassword1`, `newpassword2`, `firstname`, `lastname`, and `mail` parameters are not correctly sanitized before being displayed on the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability present is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to:
- Unauthorized actions being performed
- Unauthorized access to data
- Stealing of session information
- Denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted HTTP POST requests to the `install.php?page=4` URL, with malicious JavaScript code embedded within the vulnerable parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to craft malicious HTTP POST requests and coerce a victim to visit a link that triggers the exploit or submit the form. The attacker does not require any specific privilege on the target system. The attacker needs to know that the web application is running the vulnerable code.
