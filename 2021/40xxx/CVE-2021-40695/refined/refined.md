**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Moodle quiz web service, which allowed students to access their quiz grades before they were officially released by the instructor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Inadequate access control: The quiz web service did not properly enforce restrictions on when students could view their grades.
- Information disclosure: The vulnerability led to the exposure of sensitive data (unreleased quiz grades) to unauthorized users (students).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Students could gain an unfair advantage by seeing their grades before they were officially released.
- This could undermine the integrity of the grading process.
- It could cause student anxiety if the grade isn't final.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation occurred through the quiz web service, indicating an API-based attack vector.
- An attacker (student) would need to interact with the web service through its intended interface but in an unauthorized way.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
