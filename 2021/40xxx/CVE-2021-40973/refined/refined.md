The provided content relates to CVE-2021-40973.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled parameters within the Spotweb installer. Specifically, the `username`, `newpassword1`, `newpassword2`, `firstname`, `lastname`, and `mail` parameters are not properly sanitized before being displayed in the HTML input fields on the installation page (`templates/installer/step-004.inc.php`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The `htmlspecialchars()` function is used to encode the output, but it is insufficient in this case because the values are being placed inside of an HTML input field's `value` attribute.  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through these parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
- Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
- Gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- Stealing session information.
- Potentially leading to denial-of-service conditions.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the installation page of Spotweb. An attacker needs to craft a malicious link containing the XSS payload in the vulnerable parameters (username, newpassword1, newpassword2, firstname, lastname, or mail) and trick a user into visiting this link during the installation process. The XSS will be triggered when the victim accesses the step 4 page of the installer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with malicious parameters. They need to induce a user to visit this URL while that user is in the installation process for Spotweb, specifically step 4. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the Spotweb server.
