{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (`$keyValue` parameter) before using it in SQL queries.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, or complete system compromise. The vulnerability can be used to elevate permissions and write webshells.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET requests with a malicious `$keyValue` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints. No authentication is mentioned for the vulnerable paths, however, it is mentioned in one of the vulnerable code snippets that the vulnerable code is found under an admin path, so it may require administrative privileges."
