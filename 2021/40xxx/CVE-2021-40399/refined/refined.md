**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a use-after-free error occurring due to improper handling of HTML/XML tags within a specially crafted XLS file. A `HtmTableAlt` object is allocated, later freed, but a pointer to the freed object is still used.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Use-after-free vulnerability (CWE-416) exists because the `HtmTableAlt` object is freed via `kso!mfxGlobalFree2`, and later a virtual function call is made through a vtable pointer within the freed memory, leading to an access violation. The vulnerability lies in the way WPS Office parses a malformed XLS file containing HTML/XML tags.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can achieve this by leveraging the use-after-free to overwrite a vftable pointer in a freed memory region and redirect execution flow to a controlled location.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a malformed XLS file that contains specially crafted HTML/XML tags designed to trigger the use-after-free vulnerability when opened in WPS Office.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious XLS file to a victim who then opens the file in a vulnerable version of WPS Office. No special network access is needed other than the ability to deliver this malicious file.
