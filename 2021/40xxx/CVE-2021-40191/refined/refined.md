Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the `fileName` parameter, in the file upload functionality. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the filename. Additionally, the server responds with the wrong `Content-Type`, which further enables the exploitation of the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The application fails to sanitize the `fileName` during file uploads. This means that when the server responds to an upload request it can include the malicious javascript within the response which is then rendered by the user's browser if the filename is included in the response.
- **Insecure Content-Type:** The server sends a `text/html` Content-Type for the upload response, even when it's returning a JSON payload. This can cause the browser to render the response as HTML, which can lead to the execution of malicious scripts injected in the filename when the response is displayed within the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of a victim user's session. This can lead to various impacts, including:
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the application.
    - Potentially gaining further access to the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload Functionality:** The vulnerability is triggered via the file upload feature within the application.
- **Malicious Filename:** The attacker crafts a malicious `fileName` parameter within the upload request, injecting JavaScript code.
- **Specific HTML File:** A crafted HTML file is used to send the malicious request, demonstrating a practical way to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Response Interpretation:**  The server responds with `Content-Type: text/html` which causes the browser to render the JSON response as HTML and execute injected javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
- **Ability to Access File Upload Function:** The attacker must have access to a part of the application with file upload capabilities.
- **Ability to Craft Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests, specifically a `multipart/form-data` request to upload a file with a manipulated filename.
