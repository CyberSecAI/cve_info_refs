{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `opensysusers` utility uses the shell's `eval` function on the content of files in `/etc/sysusers.d/`. These files may contain shell metacharacters in the GECOS field or other fields, which leads to arbitrary command execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of `eval` on untrusted input",
      "Improper input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the user running `opensysusers` which is often root.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious user can create a specially crafted file in `/etc/sysusers.d/` that will contain shell metacharacters in a GECOS field that will be executed by `opensysusers`.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create or modify files within the `/etc/sysusers.d/` directory, typically requiring root or sudo access."
