- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of EMF files in Microsoft Office Visio, leading to a memory access past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Lack of proper input validation, out-of-bounds write
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:**  User interaction is required. The target must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious file (EMF).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious EMF file. The attacker does not require special privileges. The attack requires user interaction.
