Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-40345:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The content from `synacktiv.com` explicitly mentions "Command injection - CVE-2021-40345" and provides a technical description of the vulnerability, which aligns with the CVE ID. The content from `github.com_90b25495` also references the CVE, but it discusses a file upload vulnerability, which is associated with a different CVE (CVE-2021-40344). The content from `github.com_aa8f8e54` references the CVE, but it provides information about a file upload vulnerability. Therefore, only the command injection part from synacktiv.com relates to CVE-2021-40345.

**2. Vulnerability Analysis (Based on synacktiv.com content):**

   - **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw within the "Manage Dashlets" functionality in the Nagios XI admin panel. Specifically, a user-controlled filename is concatenated into a command string, which is then executed by the `system()` function without proper sanitization.

   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
      - **Command Injection:** The core issue is the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands via a crafted filename.
      - **Insecure Use of `system()`:** The `system()` function in PHP executes shell commands, which when used with unsanitized user-controlled data, creates a direct path for command injection.
      - **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code doesn't properly validate the filename, allowing an attacker to insert malicious characters and commands.

   - **Impact of Exploitation:**
      - **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user (`apache` or `nagios`).
      - **Full System Compromise:** The attacker can potentially gain full access to the server, compromise other systems on the network, exfiltrate data, or perform other malicious activities.

   - **Attack Vectors:**
      - **Malicious Dashlet Upload:** An authenticated administrator with sufficient privileges can upload a specially crafted ZIP archive via the "Manage Dashlets" feature, containing a file with a malicious filename.
      - **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered through the web interface of Nagios XI, specifically through the `admin/dashlets.php` page, by sending a crafted POST request when uploading a dashlet.

   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
      - **Administrative Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator with privileges to upload and manage dashlets.
      - **Web Interface Access:**  The attacker needs to access the web interface of the Nagios XI system.
      - **Network Accessibility:** While not explicitly required, the attacker will likely need network accessibility to the Nagios XI system to trigger the exploit.

**3. Additional Details:**

   - **Proof of Concept:** The `synacktiv.com` content provides a detailed proof-of-concept, including the creation of a malicious ZIP file and the curl command to trigger the exploit.
   - **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects Nagios XI versions 5.8.3, 5.8.4, and 5.8.5 (and potentially earlier versions).
   - **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 5.8.6 of Nagios XI.

**4. Summary of Information from Other Sources:**
   - github.com_90b25495: This source refers to the same CVE, but describes a different vulnerability (file upload) associated with CVE-2021-40344. It details how to achieve remote code execution by exploiting an insecure file upload functionality within Nagios XI.
   - github.com_aa8f8e54: This source also refers to a file upload vulnerability, providing a step-by-step guide to achieve remote code execution. It does not focus on the command injection.
   - nagios.com_41553a57: This source is an overview of Nagios XI product features and pricing plans and contains no vulnerability information.
   - assets.nagios.com_955cf2e9: This source lists the changes made in various Nagios XI versions, and states that CVE-2021-40345 is fixed in version 5.8.6.

In conclusion, the content from `synacktiv.com` provides a useful description of the command injection vulnerability (CVE-2021-40345), including its root cause, weaknesses, impact, attack vectors, and required attacker capabilities, while also providing a proof of concept for exploitation. Other sources while related to the general topic of Nagios XI security, do not pertain to CVE-2021-40345 specifically.
