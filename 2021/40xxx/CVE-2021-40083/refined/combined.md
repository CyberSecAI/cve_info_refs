## Admin message

GitLab now enforces expiry dates on tokens that originally had no set expiration date. Those tokens were given an expiration date of one year later. Please review your personal access tokens, project access tokens, and group access tokens to ensure you are aware of upcoming expirations. Administrators of GitLab can find more information on how to identify and mitigate interruption in our [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/token_overview.html#troubleshooting).

Case: NSEC3 with too many iterations used for a positive wildcard proof.

To really fix the answers, this also needed fixing the `any_rank` part
which I somehow forgot in commit [7107faeb](/knot/knot-resolver/-/commit/7107faebc72c14c864622128a20a9b39fe94d733 "validate: downgrade zone on high NSEC3 iterations") :-(
