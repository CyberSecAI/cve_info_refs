{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing null pointer check in the `naludmx_create_avc_decoder_config` function within `reframe_nalu.c`. The code dereferences a pointer without ensuring it's not NULL, leading to a segmentation fault when the pointer is indeed NULL.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A null pointer dereference leads to a segmentation fault and causes the application to crash.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted MP4 file which causes the mentioned function to be called with a NULL pointer. This can be achieved through the `MP4Box` tool.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted MP4 file as input to the `MP4Box` tool."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "vulnerability_location": "The vulnerability is located in the `naludmx_create_avc_decoder_config` function within the `reframe_nalu.c` file, specifically at line 1297.",
    "fix_details": "The fix involves adding a null check before dereferencing the pointer in `reframe_nalu.c`. The patch commit is [5ce0c90](https://github.com/gpac/gpac/commit/5ce0c906ed8599d218036b18b78e8126a496f137).",
    "poc": "A proof-of-concept MP4 file that triggers this issue is provided in the github issue report (poc.zip).",
    "affected_code": "The vulnerable code is within the `naludmx_create_avc_decoder_config` function in `src/filters/reframe_nalu.c`."
