### This comparison is taking too long to generate.

Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.

You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine:

`git diff 1.0.49...1.0.50`

### @DroidTest **[DroidTest](/DroidTest)** commented [Jul 29, 2021](#issue-955460925)

Fix the predicate that never evaluates true.

Hi,

I occasionally found the PureFTPd continues to receive a file when user quota is exceeded. My debugging shows that the following predicates never evaluate true, since max\_filesize =-1 initially:

(max\_filesize >= (off\_t) 0 &&

(max\_filesize = user\_quota\_size - quota.size) < (off\_t) 0)

When max\_filesize >=(off\_t) 0 evaluates false, the followed predicate will not be evaluated. Hence max\_filesize =-1 for ever. This bug leads to that there is no overflow even if quota is exceeded.

For a simple patch, I changed the order of these two predicates such that max\_filesize = user\_quota\_size - quota.size) < (off\_t) 0 is evaluated first, then max\_filesize will be assigned with the actual quota. Then quota will be checked correctly.

Bests

Joy

## Description

In Pure-FTPd 1.0.49, an incorrect max\_filesize quota mechanism in the server allows attackers to upload files of unbounded size, which may lead to denial of service or a server hang. This occurs because a certain greater-than-zero test does not anticipate an initial -1 value.

Initialize the max upload file size when quotas are enabled

```
Due to an unwanted check, files causing the quota to be exceeded
were deleted after the upload, but not during the upload.

The bug was introduced in 2009 in version 1.0.23

Spotted by [@DroidTest](https://github.com/DroidTest), thanks!
