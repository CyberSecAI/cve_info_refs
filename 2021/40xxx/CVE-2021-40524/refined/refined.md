Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-40524:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect `max_filesize` quota check within the Pure-FTPd server. The logic for checking if a file upload exceeds the user's quota had a flaw in the conditional statement.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Incorrect Conditional Logic:** The vulnerability lies in a conditional expression:
  ```c
  (max_filesize >= (off_t) 0 && (max_filesize = user_quota_size - quota.size) < (off_t) 0)
  ```
  - Initially `max_filesize` is -1. Due to short-circuit evaluation, `max_filesize >= (off_t) 0` is evaluated first, which is false. Thus the second part of the condition `(max_filesize = user_quota_size - quota.size) < (off_t) 0)` is never evaluated. Because of this the value of `max_filesize` remains -1 which means the size check will always fail, and files larger than the quota can be uploaded.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can upload files of unbounded size to the server, consuming excessive storage space. This can lead to a denial of service by exhausting disk space or causing the server to hang.
- **Server Hang:** The unbounded file uploads could potentially cause the server to hang or become unresponsive due to resource exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**

- **File Upload:** The primary attack vector is through the standard FTP file upload functionality. An attacker could upload files via the STOR command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **FTP Access:** The attacker needs to have a valid FTP user account with the ability to upload files.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable FTP server.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in version 1.0.23 in 2009.
- The fix involved reordering the conditions within the `if` statement to ensure the `max_filesize` variable was calculated and correctly used in the quota check. Specifically, by switching the order, the assignment to `max_filesize` and the size check will always occur:

```c
(max_filesize = user_quota_size - quota.size) < (off_t) 0)) {
```

followed by 
```c
(max_filesize >= (off_t) 0 && ...
```

- This ensures the value of `max_filesize` is calculated and then compared against 0 correctly for the size check.
