The provided content is related to CVE-2021-40607.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `schm_box_size` function due to a missing null terminator check on the URI string.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The `strlen` function attempts to read past the end of the buffer when the URI string is not null-terminated.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash: The ASAN report shows a heap-buffer-overflow, indicating that the program will likely crash.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: While not explicitly stated, heap-buffer-overflows can potentially be exploited to gain control over the program's execution flow.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing an MP4 file with a malformed 'schm' box containing a URI that isn't null terminated.
- Specifically, crafting a malicious MP4 file with a specially crafted 'schm' box triggers the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious MP4 file containing a 'schm' box with a URI that is not null terminated and provide this file as an input to the MP4Box tool.
-  The attacker needs to be able to execute `MP4Box` on the system with the crafted file.

**More details than CVE description:**
- The provided content includes a full ASAN report detailing the location and nature of the heap buffer overflow.
- It pinpoints the vulnerable code location in `isomedia/box_code_drm.c:179` within the `schm_box_size` function.
- It also includes the steps to reproduce the issue, including the exact command line and required environment, and the commit that fixes the issue.
- The root cause analysis pinpointing the lack of null termination check within the `strlen` function.
