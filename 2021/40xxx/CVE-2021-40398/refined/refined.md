Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-40398:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write in the `parse_raster_data` function of Accusoft ImageGear 19.10.
- The root cause is a missing buffer size check and incorrect size calculation when copying raster data. Specifically, the size of the allocated buffer is not respected by the function writing the data into the buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The `write_into_dest_buffer` function uses a `memcpy` to write data into a destination buffer. The size of the write is determined by data read from the source buffer, with some checks based on the destination buffer size, but the allocated destination buffer size is not respected, leading to an out-of-bounds write condition.
- **Integer Overflow:** There is a potential integer overflow during the allocation of the destination buffer `__destination_buffer`, although this is not the main root cause of the out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The out-of-bounds write can corrupt memory on the heap.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Memory corruption could lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control of the system running the vulnerable software.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File:** An attacker provides a specially crafted malformed PICT file.
- **File Parsing:** The vulnerability is triggered when the application parses the malicious PICT file using the vulnerable `parse_raster_data` function within the ImageGear library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted malformed file to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or to be authenticated.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in the `write_into_dest_buffer` function, specifically within the `memcpy` at LINE54.
- The size of the `memcpy`, `memcpy_size` is calculated at LINE48 using a value read from the input file, which is not properly validated against the allocated buffer size.
- The destination buffer is allocated in `parse_raster_data` at LINE159 and its size is based on values from the PICT file, specifically at LINE148.
- The size passed to the `write_into_dest_buffer` is not the size of the allocated buffer but a value derived from `rowbytes` inside the PICT file that is controlled by the attacker.
- The crash occurs because the `memcpy` writes past the end of the allocated buffer.
- The `raster_size`, used as the `size_dest` argument for the `write_into_dest_buffer` is calculated based on `next_offset`, or is computed based on frame fields in a PICT file.
