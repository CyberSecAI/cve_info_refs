Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2021-40353 vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `USERNAME` parameter within the `index.php` page of openSIS version 8.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `USERNAME` parameter before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Access:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** This access could lead to the ability to read, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Potential for Full System Compromise:** Depending on database permissions and the application's architecture, a successful SQL injection could potentially lead to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `index.php` page with malicious SQL code embedded within the `USERNAME` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the openSIS application.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `USERNAME` parameter in `index.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided traceback shows the SQL error resulting from the injection:

    ```
    SQL: UPDATE login_authentication SET FAILED_LOGIN=FAILED_LOGIN+1 WHERE UPPER(USERNAME)=UPPER('user1'')
    Additional Information: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near ''user1'')' at line 1
    ```
    This indicates that the single quote (') character in the injected payload is causing a syntax error, thus confirming SQL injection.
*   The `sqlmap` output confirms the SQL injection vulnerability using various techniques.
*   The provided github content confirms that `USERNAME` parameter is injectable when MySQL or MariaDB is used as the application database.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to openSIS version 8.0 when using MySQL or MariaDB.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited using error-based, time-based and stacked queries.
