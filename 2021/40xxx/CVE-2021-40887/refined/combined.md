| Dear [@ignacionelson](https://github.com/ignacionelson) , I found a Path traversal vulnerability in import-orphans.php Description Becase of lacking sanitization input for `files[]` parameter, The attacker can add `../` to move all of php files or any file on the system that has permissions to `/upload/files/` folder  [image](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/17d0e33bb3a927882d1f862a9021877e6294083a9c5230b500c31f85fa4d0c0c/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f7a5750434c4a592e706e67) Step To Reproduce  1. Using burpsuite tool to capture request of import-orphans.php function 2.

| I am not a programmer, just a user. Is this the same as this issue:  "Projectsend version r1295 is affected by a directory traversal vulnerability. Because of lacking sanitization input for files[] parameter, an attacker can add ../ to move all PHP files or any file on the system that has permissions to /upload/files/ folder. Publish Date : 2021-10-11 Last Update Date : 2021-10-18" This is the site that discusses the issue <https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2021-40887/>.  If so,would you mind giving step-by-step instructions on how to solve this? We have a small non-profit and with this program our clients can upload their files to us. We need them to be secure. Thank you in advance. |

| [@ignacionelson](https://github.com/ignacionelson) I just downloaded, copied to the ps root folder, unzippd -o, logged on to the system, and everything worked perfectly. The system logged the upgrade in the activity log (masteruser updated ProjectSend to version 1330) I clicked through all the menu's, downloaded some sample files, etc. All seems to work just fine. Is there anyhing particular you'd like me to check? |

| [@ignacionelson](https://github.com/ignacionelson) I'm just wondering if that fix for the directory traversal was ever implemented. I'm running r1335 and the proposed change above doesn't appear to be in place; I'm not a php dev though so I'm not 100% sure that it hasn't been fixed. |

| [50fc348](https://github.com/projectsend/projectsend/commit/50fc348a9e7a1661a9c70de515a2e695f3eac472) The applied solution is different but should produce the same result  Your solution doesn't catch traversing to directories that start with the same string as your target directory:  ``` <?php @mkdir ("/tmp/foo"); @mkdir ("/tmp/foo2"); define("DS", "/"); $targetDir = '/tmp/foo'; $fileName = '../foo2/bar.txt';  $basePath = $targetDir . DS;  $realBase = realpath($basePath);  $filePath = dirname($basePath . $fileName); $realFilePath = realpath($filePath);  if ($realFilePath === false || strpos($realFilePath, $realBase) !== 0) {     die("Directory Traversal Detected!"); } echo("success"); ```  This yields "success": <https://onlinephp.io/c/5cf31>  OP's suggested solution (after shifting all the backslashes 1 left to fix the syntax error) ist not a fix either, since it catches legitimate filenames that just happen to contain ".." somewhere, for example "Kelsey Grammer - So far... - Book Review.pdf" |
