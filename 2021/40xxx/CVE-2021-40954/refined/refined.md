Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecure file upload mechanism in the `/app/LKT/webapp/modules/plug_ins/actions/addAction.class.php` file. The application fails to properly filter uploaded file formats, and also extracts the content of uploaded compressed packages, automatically including the extracted files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1. **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application does not validate the type or extension of uploaded files.
2. **Arbitrary File Upload**: Attackers can upload files with any extension, including potentially executable ones.
3. **Archive Extraction:** The application automatically extracts the contents of uploaded compressed packages.
4. **Webshell Deployment:** Malicious compressed packages containing webshells can be uploaded and extracted, placing executable code within the web application's directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution on the server. An attacker can upload and deploy a webshell, gaining control of the server and potentially accessing sensitive information, modifying data, or further compromising the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is a file upload functionality. Specifically the `/app/LKT/webapp/modules/plug_ins/actions/addAction.class.php` handles the file uploads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs the ability to access the file upload functionality. This likely requires an authenticated session or access to the upload form if not behind authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported on September 10, 2021.
- The uploaded files are placed in `/APP/LKT/zip/` directory on the server.
- The issue report includes screenshots confirming the successful upload and extraction of files.
