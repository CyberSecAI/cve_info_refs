The provided content relates to CVE-2021-40188.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient file extension filtering in the File Manager function of the PHPFusion admin panel. The file manager does not properly filter out all potentially executable PHP extensions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation: The file upload functionality does not sufficiently restrict file uploads based on file extensions.
- Inadequate file type filtering: The application fails to filter out various PHP extensions, such as ".php", ".php7", ".phtml", and ".php5".
- Unrestricted file upload: The vulnerability allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files, including malicious PHP scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file and subsequently execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Server compromise: Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the server hosting the vulnerable application.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request to upload a PHP file through the vulnerable file manager.
- Exploitation of admin cookie: If an attacker steals an administrator's session cookie, they can use it to bypass authentication and upload malicious files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the admin panel: An attacker requires access to the admin panel of the PHPFusion instance.
- Valid session cookie: If the "Check uploaded files for MIME type?" is disabled, a valid admin session cookie is sufficient to upload the malicious file, even if the admin panel is protected by 2FA.
- Knowledge of file manager endpoint: An attacker needs to know the endpoint for the file manager's upload functionality.
