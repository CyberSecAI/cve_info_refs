Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Telnet server implementation in Contiki OS incorrectly handles negotiated options as defined in RFC854. Specifically, when the server receives a DO or WILL command for a disabled or unnegotiated option, it is supposed to respond with WONT or DONT respectively. However, the server doesn't always respond because it uses a fixed-size buffer to store responses without checking if the buffer is full.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of Telnet option negotiation.
- Lack of buffer overflow check when storing Telnet response messages.
- Fixed-size buffer for storing responses.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Lost responses from the Telnet server due to buffer overflow.
- Telnet clients may wait indefinitely for responses, leading to denial of service or other unexpected behaviors.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a series of DO or WILL commands for disabled or unnegotiated options to the Telnet server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to connect to the vulnerable Telnet server.
- They need the ability to send telnet commands including DO and WILL to trigger the vulnerability.
