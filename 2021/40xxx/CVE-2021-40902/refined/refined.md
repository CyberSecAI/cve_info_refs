- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input sanitization of the "Exclude URLs" field when creating a new page in the FlatCore CMS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the affected page. This could lead to session hijacking, account compromise, or other malicious activities. The attacker needs "Create new Pages" permission at least.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to be logged into the FlatCore CMS, navigate to create a new page -> Index and insert the XSS payload into the 'Exclude URLs' field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must have a valid account on the FlatCore CMS with at least the permission to create new pages.
