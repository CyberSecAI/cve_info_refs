## Summary

A DIVD researcher has identified three vulnerabilities in the [Kaseya Unitrends](https://www.unitrends.com/products/enterprise-backup-software) backup product.

Server software prior to v10.5.5-2 is vulnerable to:

* [CVE-2021-40385](/cves/CVE-2021-40385), a privilege escaltion vulnerability from read-only user to admin, and
* [CVE-2021-40387](/cves/CVE-2021-40387), an authenticated remote code execution vulnerability

Client software prior to v10.6.2 is vulnerable to:

* [CVE-2021-40386](/cves/CVE-2021-40386), a remote code execution

## What you can do

Patch server software to at least version 10.5.5-2 to remove these vulnerabilities. As per Kaseyaâs [firewall requirements](https://support.unitrends.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013264518) you are strongly advised not to expose this product to public internet.

patch clients softwate to at least version 10.6.2. The client side vulnerability can also be mitigated with firewall rules. Filter traffic to and from the client using the recommended mitigation from the [knowledge base article](https://support.unitrends.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404684084369-RCE-KB).

## What we were doing

The Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD) performed a scan to detect vulnerable Kaseya Unitrends servers and notify the owners directly or via the known abuse channels, Gov-CERTs and CSIRTs, and other trusted channels.
