Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the web-based management interface of Auerswald COMpact PBX devices. Specifically, the `fileName` parameter in the `wartemusik_verwaltung_play` and `logo_verwaltung_preview` endpoints are vulnerable to directory traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** The web interface allows users with "sub-admin" privileges to access any file on the PBX's file system by manipulating the `fileName` parameter using directory traversal sequences like `../`.
- **Cleartext Password Storage:** The configuration database (`/data/db/pbx4.db`) stores the highly privileged "Admin" user's password in clear text.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with "sub-admin" access can exploit the directory traversal vulnerability to download sensitive files, including the configuration database containing the cleartext "Admin" password.
- With the "Admin" password, the attacker can gain full administrative access, control the PBX system, and apply firmware updates, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web-based management interface of the Auerswald COMpact PBX.
- The attacker needs network access to the device's web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have valid "sub-admin" credentials to the PBX's web management interface.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple Auerswald COMpact PBX models with firmware versions <= 8.0B.
- The vulnerability was fixed in firmware version 8.2B.
- RedTeam Pentesting discovered and reported this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is assigned CVE-2021-40858.
