| Vulnerability file: `/coreframe/app/order/admin/card.php:21-45`  ```     public function listing() {         $page = isset($GLOBALS['page']) ? intval($GLOBALS['page']) : 1;         $page = max($page,1);         $batchid = isset($GLOBALS['batchid']) ? $GLOBALS['batchid'] : 0;         $keytype = isset($GLOBALS['keytype']) ? $GLOBALS['keytype'] : 0;         $keywords = isset($GLOBALS['keywords']) ? trim($GLOBALS['keywords']) : '';          $where = $batchid ? "`batchid`='$batchid'" : '';         if($keytype==0 && $keywords) {             $where = "card_no LIKE '$keywords%'";         } elseif($keytype==1 && $keywords) {             $r = $this->db->get_one('member', array('username' => $keywords));             if($r) {                 $uid = $r['uid'];                 $where = "uid = '$uid'";             } else {                 MSG('用户不存在',HTTP_REFERER);             }         }         $result = $this->db->get_list('order_card', $where, '*', 0, 20,$page,'cardid DESC');         $pages = $this->db->pages;         $total = $this->db->number;         $status_arr = array('<b>待发送</b>','未预约','已预约');         include $this->template('card_listing');     } ```  In the `card.php` file, the `$keytype` parameter and the `$keywords` parameter under the `listing` method are controllable, and the `$keywords` parameter is not strictly filtered, causing SQL injection vulnerabilities!
