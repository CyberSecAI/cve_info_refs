Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the SQL injection vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `listing` method within the `/coreframe/app/order/admin/card.php` file of Wuzhicms v4.1.0. The `$keywords` parameter, which is user-controlled, is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization for the `$keywords` parameter, making the application susceptible to SQL injection attacks. Specifically the code constructs a SQL query using string concatenation, which is vulnerable.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the query, potentially allowing them to:
    *   Access sensitive data from the database.
    *   Modify or delete data.
    *   Potentially gain control of the database server.
    *   In the given POC, the attacker is able to extract the database name using `updatexml()` SQL function
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `listing` function via the `keytype` and `keywords` parameters in the URL. An attacker could craft a malicious URL including SQL payload in `keywords`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the application.
    *   No specific user level is mentioned, thus it may be a public or authenticated user.

The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates a SQL injection using a crafted URL:
```
/index.php?m=order&f=card&_su=wuzhicms&v=listing&keytype=0&keywords=11111'/**/and/**/1=1/**/union/**/SELECT/**/updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select DATABASE()),0x7e),1);-- -
```
This POC uses a `UNION SELECT` statement along with `updatexml` to extract the database name.
