Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-40406

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an unhandled logic case in the `Login` API execution flow within the `cgiserver.cgi` of the Reolink RLC-410W camera. Specifically, if a `Login` command is sent with an empty JSON array as the request body, a session is created, but it's not properly initialized with a `VALID` or `INVALID` status. The session management function only removes sessions with these two states, causing the uninitialized session to remain in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400):** The lack of proper handling for sessions created with empty command lists leads to an accumulation of unremovable sessions in memory.
*   **Improper Session Management:**  Sessions are created but not properly initialized, leading to a state where they are never cleaned up by the session management routine.
*   **Logic flaw in API:** The API logic doesn't account for the case where a `Login` command might have an empty command list body, leading to an invalid session creation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can send specially crafted HTTP requests with empty command list bodies to create numerous invalid sessions. This fills the session list, preventing legitimate users from logging into the camera, effectively denying access to the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the `cgiserver.cgi` endpoint.
*   **JSON Body Manipulation:** The vulnerability exploits the parsing of JSON data in the request body where it provides an empty array.
*   **Login API:**  The specific API affected is the `Login` API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Reolink RLC-410W camera.
*   **HTTP Request Sending:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the target device.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in `cgiserver.cgi` and specifically involves how sessions are created and managed.
*   The `parse_incoming_and_check_command` function parses the request, and `associate_session_to_request` creates the session.
*   The `manage_existing_sessions` function is responsible for cleaning up sessions but fails to handle sessions with an unknown status.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Francesco Benvenuto of Cisco Talos.
