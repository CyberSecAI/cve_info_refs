Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Piwigo system album name and description fields do not properly sanitize user input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into these fields.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The injected malicious code is stored in the database and executed whenever the affected album properties are viewed by other users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of users who view the affected album properties. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the album name and/or description fields through the Piwigo user interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account with the necessary privileges to modify system album properties.
- The attacker does not require any specific network position, as the vulnerability is in the web application itself.
