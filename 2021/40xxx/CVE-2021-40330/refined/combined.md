git\_connect\_git(): forbid newlines in host and path

[Browse files](/git/git/tree/a02ea577174ab8ed18f847cf1693f213e0b9c473)
Browse the repository at this point in the history

```
When we connect to a git:// server, we send an initial request that
looks something like:

  002dgit-upload-pack repo.git\0host=example.com

If the repo path contains a newline, then it's included literally, and
we get:

  002egit-upload-pack repo
  .git\0host=example.com

This works fine if you really do have a newline in your repository name;
the server side uses the pktline framing to parse the string, not
newlines. However, there are many _other_ protocols in the wild that do
parse on newlines, such as HTTP. So a carefully constructed git:// URL
can actually turn into a valid HTTP request. For example:

  git://localhost:1234/%0d%0a%0d%0aGET%20/%20HTTP/1.1 %0d%0aHost:localhost%0d%0a%0d%0a

becomes:

  0050git-upload-pack /
  GET / HTTP/1.1
  Host:localhost

  host=localhost:1234

on the wire. Again, this isn't a problem for a real Git server, but it
does mean that feeding a malicious URL to Git (e.g., through a
submodule) can cause it to make unexpected cross-protocol requests.
Since repository names with newlines are presumably quite rare (and
indeed, we already disallow them in git-over-http), let's just disallow
them over this protocol.

Hostnames could likewise inject a newline, but this is unlikely a
problem in practice; we'd try resolving the hostname with a newline in
it, which wouldn't work. Still, it doesn't hurt to err on the side of
caution there, since we would not expect them to work in the first
place.

The ssh and local code paths are unaffected by this patch. In both cases
we're trying to run upload-pack via a shell, and will quote the newline
so that it makes it intact. An attacker can point an ssh url at an
arbitrary port, of course, but unless there's an actual ssh server
there, we'd never get as far as sending our shell command anyway.  We
_could_ similarly restrict newlines in those protocols out of caution,
but there seems little benefit to doing so.

The new test here is run alongside the git-daemon tests, which cover the
same protocol, but it shouldn't actually contact the daemon at all.  In
theory we could make the test more robust by setting up an actual
repository with a newline in it (so that our clone would succeed if our
new check didn't kick in). But a repo directory with newline in it is
likely not portable across all filesystems. Likewise, we could check
git-daemon's log that it was not contacted at all, but we do not
currently record the log (and anyway, it would make the test racy with
the daemon's log write). We'll just check the client-side stderr to make
sure we hit the expected code path.

Package        : git
Version        : 1:2.20.1-2+deb10u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-21300 CVE-2021-40330
Debian Bug     : 985120

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Git, a fast, scalable,
distributed revision control system, which may affect multi-user systems.

CVE-2021-21300

    A specially crafted repository that contains symbolic links as well as
    files using a clean/smudge filter such as Git LFS, may cause just-checked
    out script to be executed while cloning onto a case-insensitive file system
    such as NTFS, HFS+ or APFS (i.e. the default file systems on Windows and
    macOS).

CVE-2021-40330

    git_connect_git in connect.c allows a repository path to contain a newline
    character, which may result in unexpected cross-protocol requests, as
    demonstrated by the git://localhost:1234/%0d%0a%0d%0aGET%20/%20HTTP/1.1
    substring.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:2.20.1-2+deb10u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your git packages.

For the detailed security status of git please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/git>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
