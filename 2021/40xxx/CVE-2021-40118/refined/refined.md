Here's the breakdown of relevant information regarding CVE-2021-40118:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper input validation when parsing HTTPS requests within the web services interface of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** This vulnerability is categorized as CWE-787, indicating a memory corruption issue due to an out-of-bounds write. The improper input validation allows a crafted HTTPS request to trigger this issue.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The targeted device reloads (crashes and restarts), causing disruption of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send malicious HTTPS requests to the targeted device. No authentication is required.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Cisco ASA and FTD software.
*   It is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTPS request to the affected device.
*   The vulnerability impacts devices with specific configurations:
    *   **ASA:** AnyConnect Internet Key Exchange Version 2 Remote Access (with client services), AnyConnect SSL VPN, or Clientless SSL VPN enabled.
    *   **FTD:** AnyConnect Internet Key Exchange Version 2 Remote Access (with client services), or AnyConnect SSL VPN enabled. Remote Access VPN features were introduced in FTD Software Release 6.2.2. These features are enabled in Cisco FMC or Cisco FDM.
*   No workarounds are available.
*   Fixed software is available from Cisco for affected releases.
*   Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Ruslan Sayfiev, Denis Faiustov, and Masahiro Kawada of Ierae Security.

**Affected Products:**

*   Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software
*   Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software

**Additional Details:**

*   This CVE is part of a larger bundled publication of security advisories from Cisco (October 2021 release)
