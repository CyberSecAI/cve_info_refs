The provided content relates to CVE-2021-40923.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of sanitization of user-controlled input parameters (`first_name`, `last_name`, and `email`) in the `install/index.php` file of the "bugs" application during the installation process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application directly outputs the values of the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email` POST parameters into the HTML without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
- Performing unauthorized actions within the application.
- Gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- Stealing session information.
- Denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves coercing a user to visit a crafted link containing the malicious XSS payload. The attacker creates an HTML form with the vulnerable parameters and their XSS payloads and tricks the victim into submitting it to the vulnerable `install/index.php` page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft and deliver the malicious link to the victim. The victim needs to visit the link while not having the application installed, since the `/install/index.php` redirects to the main page if it has been installed previously.
