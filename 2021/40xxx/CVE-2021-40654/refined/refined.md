Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The D-Link DIR-615 router's firmware has a vulnerability in the `/getcfg.php` page that allows for unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The `/getcfg.php` page discloses the router's username and password in plaintext when a specific crafted POST request is sent.
*   **Lack of Authorization:** The `/getcfg.php` page can be accessed without any prior authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can obtain the router's username and password.
*   **Full Control:** With the credentials, an attacker can log into the router's administration panel and gain full control of the device, potentially leading to further malicious activity on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request Forgery:** An attacker crafts a POST request to `/getcfg.php` with the payload `SERVICES=DEVICE.ACCOUNT&AUTHORIZED_GROUP=1%0a`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the D-Link DIR-615 router's web interface. This could be from the local network or potentially from the internet if the router's administration panel is exposed.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send crafted HTTP POST requests to the target router.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** The vulnerability does not require the attacker to be authenticated to exploit the information disclosure.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is specific to D-Link DIR-615 Hardware Version Q1 Firmware Version 17.00.
*  A script is provided to automate the detection and extraction of credentials.
