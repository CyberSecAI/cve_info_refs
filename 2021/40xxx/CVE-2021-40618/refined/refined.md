Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of sanitization of input data in the `HoldAddressFields.php` file. Specifically, the script does not properly validate or sanitize user-controlled parameters before using them in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into the query by manipulating parameters such as `ADDR_CONT_USRN`, `ADDR_CONT_PSWD`, `SECN_CONT_USRN`, and `SECN_CONT_PSWD`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The provided example demonstrates that an attacker could use SQL injection to extract the database version. More broadly, successful exploitation could allow attackers to:
    - Read sensitive data from the database.
    - Modify or delete data in the database.
    - Potentially gain control over the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the `HoldAddressFields.php` file. The vulnerable parameters are located in the POST request's form data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `HoldAddressFields.php` endpoint.
- They need to be able to manipulate the form data including `ADDR_CONT_USRN`, `ADDR_CONT_PSWD`, `SECN_CONT_USRN`, and `SECN_CONT_PSWD` parameters.
- No specific privileges or authentication is mentioned in the report to be required for the exploit, implying that any user able to send a POST request to the vulnerable file can perform the attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided PoC demonstrates a successful SQL injection by using the `union select` statement to extract the database version.
- The vulnerability was reported on September 1, 2021, and fixed on September 9, 2021.
- The specific database used is MariaDB (version 10.4.20).
