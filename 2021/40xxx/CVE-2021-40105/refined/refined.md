- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies within the Markdown Editor class used in the conversation options.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Markdown editor had an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the conversation options, specifically by injecting malicious markdown code when using the Markdown editor.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to have the ability to post conversation messages that are then rendered with the vulnerable markdown editor.
