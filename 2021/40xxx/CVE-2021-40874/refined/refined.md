- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `authenticate` function in `Auth::Kerberos` always returns a success result, regardless of the provided password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect authentication logic in the `Auth::Kerberos` module within the context of the `pwdConfirm` API.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass password validation using the `/proxy/pwdConfirm` API, when using `Auth::Kerberos` in combination or alone.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a request to `/proxy/pwdConfirm` API endpoint with any password when the authentication combination includes `Auth::Kerberos`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the `/proxy/pwdConfirm` endpoint and knowledge that the LemonLDAP-NG instance is configured with an authentication combination which includes Kerberos, whether alone or combined with other authentication modules.
