# [Security: low, CVE-2021-40874] RESTServer pwdConfirm always returns true with Combination + Kerberos

### Concerned version

Version: 2.0.13

### Summary

Summarize the bug encountered concisely

* Enable restPasswordServer
* Configure Combination `[Kerberos, Demo] or [Demo]` (works with LDAP too)
* use /proxy/pwdConfirm to validate dwho/wrongpassword => returns true

### Logs

```
[debug] Entering REST pwdConfirm method
[debug] Processing getUser
[debug] Processing authenticate
[debug]  -> authResult = 0
```

Because `authenticate` always returns OK in Auth::Kerberos

See also [#2611](/lemonldap-ng/lemonldap-ng/-/issues/2611 "Plugin checkState, combination and Kerberos")

Low severity because this feature is probably not used by anyone. To successfully exploit this, a user must have deployed another application that relies on pwdConfirm to validate passwords (such as another LLNG instance using Auth::REST)
