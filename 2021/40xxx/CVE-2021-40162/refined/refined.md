Based on the provided document, here's the information related to CVE-2021-40162:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the Autodesk Image Processing component, specifically when parsing TIF, PICT, TGA, or RLC files. A maliciously crafted file can cause the software to read beyond the allocated memory boundaries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Out-of-bounds read vulnerability: The software attempts to read data from a memory location that is outside of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Arbitrary code execution: By triggering the out-of-bounds read, an attacker can potentially execute malicious code on the victim's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Maliciously crafted files: An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted TIF, PICT, TGA, or RLC file to the vulnerable software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious file to the affected software. This can be through user interaction (opening a malicious file) or potentially through another vulnerability if the file is processed without user interaction

**Additional Information**

* The document lists many Autodesk products affected by this and related CVEs.
* It also provides mitigated versions for the affected products.
* The document describes the process for obtaining security updates, either via the Autodesk Desktop App or the Accounts Portal.
