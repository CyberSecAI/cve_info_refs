Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-40871:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a wrong type-cast within the Softing OPC UA C++ SDK client functionality. This occurs when the client processes specially crafted messages received from a server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The core issue is the lack of proper validation of input messages received by the client, leading to the type-cast error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can send carefully crafted messages that trigger the incorrect type-cast. This causes the client process to crash unexpectedly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based attack:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending malicious OPC UA messages to a vulnerable client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with an OPC UA client that uses the vulnerable Softing SDK.
- **Compromised or Untrusted Server:** The attack is facilitated if the client connects to a compromised or untrusted server, which can then send the malicious messages.
- **Low Privileges Required:** The CVSS vector string indicates low privileges (PR:L) are required, indicating that an attacker may need to be a legitimate user of the system that the OPC client is on, but does not need administrator level permissions.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is found in the Softing OPC UA C++ SDK and affects multiple products using it.
- A security update (version 5.66 for the SDK) has been released to address this issue.
- The issue is described as publicly not disclosed and not exploited in the bulletin.
- The bulletin provides mitigation advice to use secure connections to avoid communication with untrusted servers.
