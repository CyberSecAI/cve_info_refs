- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web application fails to sanitize user input on the Security User configuration dialog and Task tab.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject HTML or browser-interpreted content into the web application. This XSS can be displayed during authentication, in logs, and persist in the logs even after the rogue input values are changed to correct ones.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to access the web management interface with a valid or hijacked session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have access to the web management interface with valid credentials or through a hijacked session.
