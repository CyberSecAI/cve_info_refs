{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a chain of three issues: a CSRF vulnerability in the plugin upload feature, which enables remote code execution (RCE) by uploading a malicious plugin, and a stored XSS vulnerability, which allows an attacker to automate the exploitation without user interaction.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) in the plugin upload feature",
      "Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability",
        "Insecure plugin upload"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution (RCE) that is initiated by tricking an administrator into visiting a malicious page.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "One-click technique: The attacker uploads a malicious web page or SVG image and sends its URL to an admin. Upon the admin loading the file in their browser, a plugin is uploaded to the Chamilo server, which allows for subsequent RCE by navigating to the plugin directory.",
       "Zero-click technique: The attacker injects malicious javascript into the 'My Diplomas' feature of their profile. When an admin visits the attacker's profile, the malicious Javascript is executed, uploading a malicious plugin and allowing for RCE."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs a student account on the Chamilo LMS and the ability to upload files or inject Javascript into specific user profile fields. Exploitation requires an administrator to visit the attackerâ€™s profile."
