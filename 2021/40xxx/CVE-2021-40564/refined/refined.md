Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-40564:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the `avc_parse_slice` function located in `av_parsers.c` within the GPAC library.
- Specifically, the code accesses `si->pps` without properly verifying if `si` or `si->pps` are valid, before accessing  `si->pps->slice_group_count`, causing a crash if `si->pps` is NULL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The code directly accesses a member of a pointer (`si->pps->slice_group_count`) without ensuring that the pointer (`si->pps`) is not NULL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): The null pointer dereference leads to a segmentation fault, causing the application (MP4Box) to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted MP4 file: A specially crafted MP4 file can trigger the vulnerable code path when processed by MP4Box, leading to the crash.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious MP4 file to be processed by the vulnerable version of GPAC's MP4Box tool.

**Additional Information**
- The provided GitHub issue #1898 details the vulnerability and how to reproduce it by using the command `MP4Box -info poc`.
- The patch for this vulnerability added a check `if (!si->pps->slice_group_count) return -2;` to prevent the null pointer dereference and is part of commit `cf6771c`.
- The Debian Security Advisory DSA-5411-1 lists CVE-2021-40564 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in the updated gpac package.
