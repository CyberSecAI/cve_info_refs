Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-40843:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Proofpoint Insider Threat Management (ITM) Server contains an unsafe deserialization vulnerability in its Web Console.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsafe Deserialization:** The core issue is the unsafe deserialization of data retrieved from the database within the ITM Web Console. This means that the application is not properly validating or sanitizing data before converting it from a serialized format back into an object, potentially allowing the execution of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on the underlying server. This means the attacker could gain complete control of the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Database Manipulation:** An attacker requires write access to the local database.
*   **Web Console Trigger:** A Web Console user must trigger the retrieval of the maliciously crafted data.
*   **Chained with SQL Injection (Potential):** The advisory mentions that if chained with a SQL injection vulnerability, the deserialization vulnerability could potentially be exploited remotely. This would require a Web Console user to click a series of maliciously crafted URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Write access to the local database** is a must
*   **SQL Injection (Optional):** To exploit remotely, the attacker may chain the vulnerability with an SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Web Console User Interaction:** The attack requires a Web Console user to trigger a data retrieval operation.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a critical issue because it can lead to full system compromise via arbitrary code execution. It exists due to unsafe deserialization within the Proofpoint Insider Threat Management Server. While the most direct attack vector requires access to the local database, the potential for remote exploitation exists when chaining it with a SQL injection vulnerability.
