Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-40317

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `id` parameter within the `admin/cat_move.php` file of Piwigo version 11.5.0. Specifically, the application directly uses the unsanitized `$_POST['id']` parameter in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is an SQL injection vulnerability caused by the direct use of user-supplied input in an SQL query without proper sanitization or validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Compromise:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code that could allow them to:
    - Access sensitive data within the database.
    - Modify or delete database records.
    - Potentially gain further access to the server or the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `admin/cat_move.php` file. The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter in the POST data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin Access:** An attacker needs to have administrative access to the Piwigo instance. They must be able to log in to the `/admin.php` page.
- **Burp Suite or similar tool:**  The attacker needs to use a tool such as Burp Suite to intercept and modify the HTTP POST request, crafting the malicious SQL payload.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft the injection payload.
