## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### How does Enterprise Application Access differ from using a VPN?

VPNs have simple allow/deny non-intelligent capabilities that give users corporate network–level access. If your VPN is compromised by an attacker, they can use that initial foothold to move laterally and deploy malware, ransomware, or exfiltrate data. Enterprise Application Access delivers Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) to provide least-privilege application access to deny or restrict access based on identity, context, and security posture. This eliminates network-level access and ensures that users only have access to the applications and application features that they need for their role.

### How does Enterprise Application Access differ from other Zero Trust access products?

Most Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solutions create tunnels and have a reverse proxy to allow user access, but they do not have inspection and service creation policies. They only protect the integrity of the transfer. Enterprise Application Access wants to know what the contents of that communication path are in addition to ensuring the integrity of the transfer, thereby increasing secure access. For apps that need an additional layer of protection, Akamai [App & API Protector](/products/app-and-api-protector) can be utilized to further harden your security posture.

### Does Enterprise Application Access integrate with MFA solutions?

When the Akamai IdP capability is used, Enterprise Application Access integrates directly with Akamai MFA to provide phish-proof multi-factor authentication. It also integrates with Cisco Duo. If a third-party IdP is used, Enterprise Application Access will use the MFA service deployed in the IdP.

### What is Enterprise Application Access device posture?

Enterprise Application Access device posture is a key feature for allowing, denying, or limiting user access to applications. It operates alongside authentication authorization and access control rules, and gathers information about the status of the device (e.g., if the device firewall is enabled, if it has the most up-to-date operating system, or if anti-malware is installed). It also gathers external threat signals from Akamai Secure Internet Access, Carbon Black, and CrowdStrike. You can create risk tiers that allow you to deny or limit application features based on the risk profile of the device. Device posture helps to ensure that the devices accessing applications satisfy the necessary security requirements.

### Which identity providers does Enterprise Application Access integrate with?

Enterprise Application Access integrates with most existing identity providers (IdPs), such as Akamai, Google, Ping, Okta, Microsoft Azure AD, or any other SAML-based IdPs.

### How does Enterprise Application Access connect to my applications?

This is done by deploying the Akamai connector virtual machine in the same location as the applications you want to make available. The connector can be installed in on-premises data centers and private and public clouds. Once deployed, the connector establishes a connection with the application, then makes an outbound connection to the Enterprise Application Access reverse proxy. When an authorized user connects to the application, the proxy connects the user to the application. Connectors are available for VMware, VirtualBox, Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2/VPC, OpenStack/KVM, Microsoft Hyper-V, Docker, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Engine (GCE).

### How does Enterprise Application Access ensure that applications are fast and responsive?

Enterprise Application Access is delivered from Akamai Connected Cloud, the world’s most distributed cloud security platform. This ensures that ZTNA infrastructure is deployed close to where your users are located and applications are hosted. Application traffic is automatically routed over Akamai Connected Cloud between the user and application to ensure that applications are fast and responsive and deliver a delightful end-user experience.

### How does Enterprise Application Access support hybrid working?

Enterprise Application Access allows you to enforce consistent application access policies, irrespective of where your users are working from. For the scenario where applications are hosted on-premises and users are working in the office, the local PoP capability enforces the access policy and connects directly to the application to eliminate the performance impact of hairpinning traffic to the cloud PoP.

## Zero Trust Network Access Use Cases

Learn more about a few common ways Enterprise Application Access is used.

1. Application access based on Zero Trust
2. Reduce your reliance on virtual private networks (VPNs)
3. Fast and secure application access for your hybrid workforce
4. Secure application access for contractors and partners

#### Application access based on Zero Trust

### Application access based on Zero Trust

Providing secure access to applications and resources is a key step for any organization moving to a Zero Trust Architecture. Enterprise Application Access is a complete Zero Trust Network Access solution based on Zero Trust principles of “never trust, always verify” and provides dynamic application access based on identity, context, and device posture. It eliminates implicit trust and enforces strict identity verification and least-privilege access policies for every user identity, device, or application regardless of where they are located, and supports all cloud environments. Enterprise Application Access reduces an enterprise’s attack surface, prevents lateral movement, and simplifies administrator experiences through centralized policy management.

#### Reduce your reliance on virtual private networks (VPNs)

### Reduce your reliance on virtual private networks (VPNs)

VPNs provide employees remote access to corporate resources and applications located in on-premises data centers. But as organizations move to the cloud, applications can be hosted everywhere, and hybrid working means employees are working from anywhere using managed and unmanaged devices. VPNs also require inbound access through the firewall, which exposes your applications and can lead to threat actors gaining unbridled access to your network. Enterprise Application Access eliminates network-level access and replaces it with granular access to specific applications hosted anywhere and employees working everywhere.

#### Fast and secure application access for your hybrid workforce

### Fast and secure application access for your hybrid workforce

Hybrid work environments, which include both in-office and remote users, can increase your organization’s attack surface. Enterprise Application Access offers a more secure solution by providing access to private applications on a per-app basis, eliminating the need for network-wide access. This approach reduces your attack surface and prevents lateral movement in the event of a security breach. It ensures a secure, seamless, and low-latency experience for all users, regardless of their location, while maintaining a strong security posture for your hybrid work program.

#### Secure application access for contractors and partners

### Secure application access for contractors and partners

Providing secure application access for partners, suppliers, and contractors limits your cybersecurity risk. Enterprise Application Access is a ZTNA solution that provides application access at a per-app level without the need for network access, which limits your attack surface should a third-party endpoint or user identity become compromised. Simplify onboarding by using the Enterprise Application Access cloud IdP to quickly add third-party users.

This post covers the details of CVE-2021-40683 (CVSS [6.5](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)), the vulnerability impacting the Akamai Enterprise Application Access (EAA) Client running on Windows systems, for which Akamai has provided a patch to its customers.

On August 31, 2021, Akamai was notified by a customer conducting an assessment of the EAA Client application that they had identified an unquoted service path vulnerability introduced when installing the client on an endpoint. Upon reviewing the report, Akamai initiated its incident management process to verify the report, create a fixed version of the EAA Client, and communicate the need for patching to its customers. Details about the vulnerability, the potential impact on clients, and the remediation process are covered in the remainder of this post.

## Vulnerability overview

The vulnerability identified in the EAA Client is known as an unquoted service path or a [path interception by unquoted path](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/009/) vulnerability. This vulnerability takes advantage of a weakness in the way Windows handles paths provided when spawning a new process, either through the [CreateProcess](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessa) function or through a service registered in the Windows registry. In either method of invocation, the path to the executable, or the ImagePath in the case of a Windows service, must be quoted if the path contains a space to limit the potential for an unexpected application to be run. This unexpected behavior stems from the way in which Windows will interpret spaces in a path, like that found in C:\Program Files, if the path is not quoted. With both invocations, when an unquoted space is encountered, the path before the space will be checked for an executable meeting the invocation’s criteria. In most cases, no such application will exist, and the processing will continue until the full path of the executable is reached and launched.

By way of example from the [CreateProcess documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessa), if there is an executable at *C:\Program Files\Sub Dir\Program Name.exe*, the operating system will attempt to launch the following applications, if present, in the following order:

```

C:\Program.exe

```
```

C:\Program Files\Sub.exe

```
```

C:\Program Files\Sub Dir\Program.exe

```
```

C:\Program Files\Sub Dir\Program Name.exe

```

The checking of additional paths may allow an adversary the opportunity to place a malicious process at any of the paths listed above, which would be executed with the same level of permissions as the expected process, and could lead to an escalation of privilege when a higher-privilege identity is used, like in the case of the EAA Client.

The solution to avoid this search processing is presented in the [Security Remarks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessa#security-remarks) section of the same documentation, which recommends putting any path that includes spaces in quotes, which will indicate that searching should not be conducted. For the example above, the recommendation would be to use the string “*C:\Program Files\Sub Dir\Program Name.exe*” for any invocation of that executable.

In the case of the EAA Client, a Windows service is installed to enable the client to operate. Prior to the fix, the ImagePath, or path to the executable to launch for the service, was set to

```

C:\Program Files\EAAClient\wapptunneld.exe

```

and following the fix, the path was set to

```

“C:\Program Files\EAAClient\wapptunneld.exe”

```

During our investigation, our engineering and security teams tested to ensure that, by default, windows restricts the creation of files at *C:\Program.exe* to administrative-level users, which dramatically limits the exposure of this issue. But out of an abundance of caution, we continued to develop and release the fixed version of our client in the event that some environments deviate from the default permissions for *C:\*.

## Potential impact

Due to the path searching, there was a potential for an actor to place a malicious executable at the path *C:\Program.exe*, which would have been executed as an administrator when attempting to launch the EAA Client service, either at machine boot or when the EAA Client service restarted for some reason. If this were to happen, the malicious application would have had administrative access to the system and would have been able to take any action an administrator could.

During the analysis of the issue, we determined that the default configuration of Windows would restrict changes to the required path to administrative users, thus requiring a similar level of access as an actor would get by conducting this type of attack. Additionally, if this vulnerability were exploited, the wapptunneld executable would not be started, preventing the EAA Client on the endpoint from functioning, which would likely require further investigation or remediation.

## Suggested actions

Akamai recommends that all Windows endpoints running the EAA Client be upgraded to one of the fixed versions, which are 2.5.3, 2.4.1, and 2.3.1. At this time, no older versions have been fixed, as their support has ended.

Akamai also recommends reviewing other applications and services installed on endpoints to ensure that they are not vulnerable to this same attack, as this method is not specific to the EAA Client.

## Timeline

All times in UTC

| Time stamp | Event |
| --- | --- |
| 31 Aug 2021 06:22 | Initial report sent to Akamai |
| 31 Aug 2021 13:24 | Akamai begins its review of the report |
| 31 Aug 2021 14:28 | Akamai incident response started |
| 02 Sep 2021 16:00 | Patched clients released and customers notified |
| 04 Oct 2021 16:00 | This post released |

We elected to delay disclosure of the details of the vulnerability to allow customers to patch their endpoints prior to disclosure.
