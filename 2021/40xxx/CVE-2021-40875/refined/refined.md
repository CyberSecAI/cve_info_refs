Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-40875:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper access control in Gurock TestRail versions prior to 7.2.0.3014. Specifically, the `/files.md5` endpoint was accessible without authentication, revealing a list of all application files and their corresponding paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The `/files.md5` file exposed the application's file structure, including paths to potentially sensitive files.
- **Missing Authentication/Authorization:**  Lack of proper access controls on certain file paths allowed unauthenticated access to sensitive files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Attackers could access configuration files, database backups (specifically `full.sql`), and other files containing hardcoded credentials, API keys, passwords, secrets, and other sensitive data. This would allow for the compromise of the TestRail installation and could potentially lead to further access of the affected environment.
- **Compromise of TestRail Application:** By obtaining database backups, an attacker could gain full control of the TestRail instance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Request to `/files.md5`:** An attacker can access the `/files.md5` file by sending a simple HTTP request to the endpoint without authentication.
- **Path Traversal/Fuzzing:** Using the file paths exposed in the `/files.md5` file, an attacker can attempt to access the corresponding files, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the TestRail server.
- **Basic HTTP Request Knowledge:** The attacker only needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the server, no authentication is required initially.
- **Understanding of Fuzzing:** Fuzzing/bruteforcing may be required to discover the exploitable files.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability primarily affects government and large corporations using TestRail.
- Custom file paths were observed in some instances making it important to use a custom wordlist to enumerate the available files.
-  Exploitation can be automated using provided scripts (Python and Bash), which are available publicly.
- The vulnerability was identified using Burp Suite, and then further developed by the researchers who discovered the issue.
