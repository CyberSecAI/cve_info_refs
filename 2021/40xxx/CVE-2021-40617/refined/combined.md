| Hi [@openSISAdmin](https://github.com/openSISAdmin), [@ArnabOs4ed](https://github.com/ArnabOs4ed) , I found a sql injection vulnerability in `ForgotPassUserName` function. I can inject special character in URL to escape SQL query in backend because of lacking of sanitize user input. PoC: `http://172.16.0.12:2222/ForgotPassUserName.php?used_for=username&u=admin%27%20or%20%271%27=%271` Bug: ```         if($used_for=='username')         {             $username = $_GET['u']; // <--- Lacking of sanitize input here!!!             $usr_type = $_GET['user_type'];             $found= false;             if($usr_type=='student')             {                 $check_uname=  DBGet(DBQuery('SELECT * FROM login_authentication WHERE USERNAME = \''.$username.'\'  AND PROFILE_ID IN (SELECT ID FROM user_profiles WHERE PROFILE=\'student\')'));             }             elseif($usr_type=='staff')              {                 $check_uname=  DBGet(DBQuery('SELECT * FROM login_authentication WHERE USERNAME = \''.$username.'\'  AND PROFILE_ID IN (SELECT ID FROM user_profiles WHERE ID NOT IN (0,3,4))'));             }             else             {                 $check_uname=  DBGet(DBQuery('SELECT * FROM login_authentication WHERE USERNAME = \''.$username.'\'  AND PROFILE_ID IN (SELECT ID FROM user_profiles WHERE PROFILE=\'parent\')'));             }             if($check_uname[1]['USERNAME']!='')             {                 echo '1';             }             else                 echo '0';         }  ```  In line 278, the code does not sanitize param `u`, in order that, I can escape the SQL query easily. Solution: Use function `sqlSecurityFilter()` before assign `$_GET['u'];` to `username` param. The code should look like:  ``` $username = sqlSecurityFilter($_GET['u']);  ``` |

| Dear openSIS Administrator, After auditing your source-code, I found many vulnerabilities, most of them are SQL Injection. The reason causes many bugs because you missed to filter user input parameters before assigning to php parameters. So, to secure your solution, please recheck and fix all mistake in your code, please! If you need a support to secure your code, feel free to contact me! I always willing to help you! And obviously, It's free! ‚Ä¶ On Sat, Sep 4, 2021 at 3:08 AM openSIS Administrator < \*\*\*@\*\*\*.\*\*\*> wrote: Fixed ‚Äî You are receiving this because you authored the thread.

| [@H4niz](https://github.com/H4niz)  Thanks for your note. We will sincerely appreciate it if you can chip in and fix the vulnerabilities that you have found. Please make sure you do not regress any system functionalities as it is largely undocumented.  Please do PR for the fixes. |
