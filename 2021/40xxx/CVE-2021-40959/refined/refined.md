- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability exists due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of the victim's session, potentially leading to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a malicious URL with a payload injected into the `process` parameter of the `/process_management/process_status.xhr.php` subpage.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft and send the malicious URL to a victim user, typically through social engineering or other means.
