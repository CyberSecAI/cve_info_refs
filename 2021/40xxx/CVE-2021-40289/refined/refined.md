Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the XSS vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically within the "tags" parameter when creating a new space.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: The application stores the unsanitized input and renders it later when a user views the content.
- Lack of input validation or sanitization: The application doesn't filter or encode the user-provided 'tags' value allowing the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
- When a user accesses the page where the malicious script is rendered, the injected code will be executed within the user's browser session. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking: Stealing session cookies.
    - Data theft: Accessing sensitive information that the user has access to.
    - Defacement: Modifying the content of the page seen by users.
    - Redirection: Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user: Including changing user settings, sending messages, or accessing resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a POST request to `/system/space/save`
- The payload is injected into the `tags` parameter with an HTML img tag containing an `onerror` event handler.
- Example payload: `space_ id=&name=hcw&description=11E&tags=</span></td><img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>&visit_ level=public&is_ share=1`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make a POST request to the `/system/space/save` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious payload for the tags parameter.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as it appears the vulnerability is present in the space creation form.
- Any user visiting the page where this data is rendered will trigger the XSS.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in version v0.2.1
- The issue was reported on August 27, 2021
- A screenshot of the vulnerability is available at [cve_20210827195158](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38160485/131123610-db8266de-95fa-4930-bdd3-548491f40881.jpg)
