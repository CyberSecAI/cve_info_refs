- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect default permissions on the installation directory of Advantech WISE-PaaS/OTA Server allow the "Everyone" group full control over service binary files, including executables and libraries loaded by the "postgresql" service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Incorrect default permissions (CWE-276) on the installation directory.
  - Service binaries and libraries within the installation directory are writable by the "Everyone" group.
  - The "postgresql" service executes with "NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE" privileges and possesses `SeImpersonatePrivilege`.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
  - Privilege escalation from any user to "NETWORK SERVICE" by replacing service binaries.
  - Further privilege escalation to "NT SYSTEM" by exploiting the `SeImpersonatePrivilege` of the "NETWORK SERVICE" account.
  - Full control of the system can be achieved.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - A local attacker replaces a vulnerable service binary/library in the installation directory with a malicious file.
  - The attacker then restarts the service to trigger the vulnerability and escalate privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - Local access to the target system.
  - Ability to write to files in the installation directory.
  - Ability to restart services.
