{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application takes relative path locations as input to execute PowerShell scripts. It does not properly validate or sanitize these paths, allowing for directory traversal, fully qualified path names, and UNC paths to be used.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Path traversal vulnerability",
      "Unrestricted file access"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP requests with malicious JSON parameters",
        "Directory traversal using '..\\'",
        "Specifying fully qualified file paths",
        "Specifying UNC paths to attacker-controlled network shares"

    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have knowledge of potential script locations or the ability to write/upload scripts to the server. In the case of UNC paths the attacker requires an accessible remote network share."
