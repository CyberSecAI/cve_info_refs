The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-40415.

**CVE-2021-40415**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an improper access control issue in the `cgi_check_ability` function within the Reolink RLC-410W's firmware. This function checks if a user has the required permissions to execute a given API command. However, for certain API calls like `Format`, the function doesn't have a specific case in its switch statement, causing it to default to a permission level of 7 which allows access to any API regardless of privileges.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Improper access control, specifically the lack of specific permission checks for certain API calls and a default permission that allows unauthorized access.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker, even with non-administrative privileges, can send an HTTP request to the `Format` API causing the device to format its SD card, deleting all recordings, and rebooting the device. This leads to a denial of service condition.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request to the `cgiserver.cgi` service.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the device. However, the document mentions that this can be combined with another vulnerability (TALOS-2021-1420) to exploit the device without prior authentication.
