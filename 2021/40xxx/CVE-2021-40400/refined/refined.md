The provided content is a detailed vulnerability report for CVE-2021-40400.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in the `simplify_aperture_macro` function when handling the "outline" primitive of an aperture macro in RS-274X Gerber files. The size of the stack buffer used to hold macro parameters is determined by the number of push operations in the macro definition, whereas the number of parameters copied from this stack is derived from the stack content itself leading to an attacker controlled size via the crafted gerber file. When the copy size is larger than allocated buffer, the out-of-bounds read occurs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**: The code doesn't properly validate the number of parameters to be read from the stack against the allocated size of the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure**: An attacker can craft a malicious Gerber file that, when parsed by Gerbv, leads to an out-of-bounds read from the heap and leak of potentially sensitive information. Specifically, the heap memory adjacent to the stack used in processing the macro is read and used in subsequent steps. If the attacker has access to the output of the conversion (e.g., if the service using Gerbv converts a `.gbr` file into a `.png` and returns it to the user), the attacker can potentially extract heap metadata or contents by reading the resulting rendered image.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker provides a specially crafted Gerber file to a vulnerable version of Gerbv. The vulnerability can be triggered by loading this file via the command-line tool or through services using Gerbv as a shared library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to submit a crafted Gerber file to a system that is running a vulnerable version of Gerbv. The attacker doesn't require any special privileges and there is no need for user interaction.
