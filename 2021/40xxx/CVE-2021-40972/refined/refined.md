The provided content relates to CVE-2021-40972.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled parameters (`username`, `newpassword1`, `newpassword2`, `firstname`, `lastname`, and `mail`) within the `templates/installer/step-004.inc.php` file during the installation process of Spotweb.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The `htmlspecialchars()` function is used for output encoding, however, it is not enough to prevent XSS in this context because the input fields are within the HTML attributes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to:
    - Unauthorized actions being performed.
    - Unauthorized access to data.
    - Stealing of session information.
    - Denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could craft a malicious link with an XSS payload embedded within the URL parameters and coerce a user into visiting that link. The XSS is reflected from the vulnerable input fields during the installation process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to visit a malicious link containing the XSS payload. They do not require any other special privileges or access to the server.
