- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software is vulnerable to out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction (UI:R)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the system and the user needs to interact with a malicious file or data.
