{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `cgi_check_ability` function in Reolink RLC-410W firmware does not properly check user permissions for certain API calls. Specifically, some APIs are not included in the switch statement within this function, causing them to default to a permission check that always passes.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Access Control: The `cgi_check_ability` function fails to properly restrict access to certain APIs, allowing non-admin users to execute privileged commands.",
      "Missing Cases in Switch Statement: The switch statement within the `cgi_check_ability` function lacks cases for specific API calls, resulting in a default permission check that allows unauthorized access."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Non-admin users can execute privileged APIs, leading to various impacts including: Rebooting the device, modifying movement detection parameters, formatting the SD card, and gaining unauthorized access to potentially sensitive information via GET APIs.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request to the affected APIs.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be an authenticated user. However, it is also mentioned that it is possible to chain this vulnerability with TALOS-2021-1420 to perform these API calls without authentication."
