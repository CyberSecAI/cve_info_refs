{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A null pointer dereference occurs when the filter process is triggered on non-source filters when the \"src\" parameter is set.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Null pointer dereference"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault (SEGV) and program termination.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted command-line argument to the GPAC application using the 'nhmlr' filter with the 'src' parameter set.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to provide a specific command-line argument to the GPAC application, triggering the filter process on a non-source filter. No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability."
