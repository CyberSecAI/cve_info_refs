The provided content is related to CVE-2021-40543.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the `PasswordCheck.php` file. Specifically, the `$_GET['usrid']` and `$_GET['prof_id']` parameters are not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication, extract sensitive information from the database, and potentially modify data. The provided example shows an attacker able to dump users from the database.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `PasswordCheck.php` file. The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `usrid` and `prof_id` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They simply need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `PasswordCheck.php` file.
