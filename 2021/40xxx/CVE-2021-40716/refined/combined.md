Multiple vulneratibilities were found in exempi, an implementation of XMP
(Extensible Metadata Platform).

CVE-2020-18651

    A Buffer Overflow vulnerability was found
    in function ID3_Support::ID3v2Frame::getFrameValue
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2020-18652

    A Buffer Overflow vulnerability was found in
    WEBP_Support.cpp allows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service.

CVE-2021-36045

    An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found
    that could lead to disclosure of arbitrary memory.

CVE-2021-36046

    potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution
    in the context of the current use

CVE-2021-36047

    An Improper Input Validation vulnerability was found,
    potentially resulting in arbitrary
    code execution in the context of the current use.

CVE-2021-36048

    An Improper Input Validation was found,
    potentially resulting in arbitrary
    code execution in the context of the current user.

CVE-2021-36050

    A buffer overflow vulnerability was found,
    potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution
    in the context of the current user.

CVE-2021-36051

    resulting in arbitrary code execution in the context of
    the current user.

CVE-2021-36057

     A write-what-where condition vulnerability was found,
     caused during the application's memory allocation process.
     This may cause the memory management functions to become
