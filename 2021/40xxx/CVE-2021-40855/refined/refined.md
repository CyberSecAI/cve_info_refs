- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Re-use of Digital Signing Certificates (DSC) public key certificates between production and testing environments. This was due to the then-applicable "Guidelines for the Governance of the Public Key Certificates" adopted in May 2021.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reused DSC public keys between production and non-production environments.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The description doesn't explicitly detail an exploit scenario or impact, but implies that reusing keys between testing and production environments could compromise the trustworthiness of the production keys.
- **Attack vectors**: Not explicitly defined, but the vulnerability stems from the mismanaged generation and distribution of DSC public key certificates within the EU DCC system. The attack vector would involve exploiting the trust in these keys.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No explicit attacker capabilities are mentioned in the report. It can be inferred that if a malicious actor gained control of a testing environment they might have been able to use the duplicate keys to manipulate the production environment, though the specific method is not described.
