The provided content relates to CVE-2021-40922.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled parameters (`first_name`, `last_name`, and `email`) in the `install/index.php` file of the "bugs" application during the installation process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present in the `install/index.php` file. Specifically, the application directly outputs the values of the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email` POST parameters into HTML input fields without any form of sanitization or encoding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameters. When a user visits the installation page with the crafted payload, the injected script will execute within their browser, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data access, session theft, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted HTTP POST requests to the `install/index.php` page. The attacker needs to trick a victim into submitting a form with malicious javascript in the `first_name`, `last_name`, or `email` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests and needs a victim to visit the crafted link or submit the crafted form. The attacker doesn't need any special privileges or access to the server itself.
