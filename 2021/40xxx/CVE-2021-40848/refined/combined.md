# Exporting of CSV files needs to sanitize data

Bug #1930471 reported by

### Bug Description

When we export CSV files, like we do in the reports pages, we don't sanitize the output.

This means if a person saves data (like their username) beginning with certain characters, eg = or + etc then the data when added into a spreadsheet program will interpret the value as a command.

This allows one to create a malicious string so that they can exploit spreadsheet vulnerabilities.

Though this exploit isn't effecting Mahara itself - it can be the vector of transmission.

It will be best if we sanitize the CSV exports to avoid this.

A suggestion is to add a TAB character before any string that begins with a susceptible character

A potential exploit example

Making a username be:

='file:///etc/passwd'#$passwd.A1

then selecting person via Admin -> People page and exporting CSV of them

For the security forum post:

Vulnerability type: Other (CSV Injection)

Attack type: Local

Impact: Code execution

Affected components: Exported CSV files with personal data that are imported into a spreadsheet software

Attack vectors: If a person saves data (like their username) beginning with certain characters, e.g. = or + etc. then the data when added into a spreadsheet program will be interpreted as a command. This allows one to create a malicious string so that they can exploit spreadsheet vulnerabilities. Mahara itself is not vulnerable, but it can be the vector of transmission.

Suggested description: In Mahara before 20.04.5, 20.10.3, 21.04.2, and 21.10.0, exported CSV files could contain characters that a spreadsheet program could interpret as a command and execute a malicious string locally on a device.

## Create portfolios

Using Mahara, students and staff create their personal learning stories by uploading evidence of activities they have participated in, and embedding publicly accessible content they have previously put online. They can write reflections on their experiences that frame this evidence, map it to competencies or registration requirements, and provide necessary context.

Mahara can be used for many different portfolio purposes, such as study, professional development, work-integrated learning, assessment, showcase and presentation, and employability.

## Share work

Mahara allows portfolios to be shared flexibly with one person, a specific group of people, or the entire world. Access can be further restricted to a particular time frame or just within an assessment task.

Vulnerability type: Other (CSV Injection)
Attack type: Local
Impact: Code execution

Affected components: Exported CSV files with personal data that are imported into a spreadsheet software
Attack vectors: If a person saves data (like their username) beginning with certain characters, e.g. = or + etc. then the data when added into a spreadsheet program will be interpreted as a command. This allows one to create a malicious string so that they can exploit spreadsheet vulnerabilities. Mahara itself is not vulnerable, but it can be the vector of transmission.

Description: In Mahara before 20.04.5, 20.10.3, 21.04.2, and 21.10.0, exported CSV files could contain characters that a spreadsheet program could interpret as a command and execute a malicious string locally on a device.
