Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-40644 (Note: The provided content does not explicitly state this CVE ID, but the identified vulnerability matches the description associated with this ID.)

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `src/main/resources/mappers/notice-mapper.xml` file of the oasys project.
- The code directly uses `${baseKey}` within a SQL `LIKE` clause for a fuzzy query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The use of `${baseKey}` in the `LIKE` clause allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. This is because the value of `baseKey` is not properly sanitized or parameterized before being incorporated into the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to sensitive database information. 
- The attacker can bypass intended access controls and perform malicious queries.
- The provided text shows the attacker can enumerate the databases, as shown by the SQLMAP command.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited via the `informlistpaging` endpoint by manipulating the `baseKey` parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs a regular user account to be able to access the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker would need to craft a malicious payload within the `baseKey` parameter.
- They can use tools like Burp Suite to capture the request and SQLMap to perform the SQL injection.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code snippet is:
  ```xml
  <select id="sortMyNotice" resultType="java.util.Map">
    SELECT n.*,u.* FROM aoa_notice_list AS n 
    LEFT JOIN aoa_notice_user_relation AS u ON n.notice_id=u.relatin_notice_id 
    WHERE u.relatin_user_id=#{userId}  
    <if test="baseKey !=null"> and n.title LIKE '%${baseKey}%' </if>
  </select>
  ```

- The attacker constructs a URL with a malicious `baseKey` payload, for example:
  `http://localhost/informlistpaging?baseKey=Payload`.

- The attacker then captures the request with Burp Suite and saves it to a file, then tests with SQLMap: `sqlmap.py -r D:\test.txt --random-agent --dbs --current-db`

**Mitigation:**
The text does not include mitigation advice, but here's general advice for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of string concatenation to build SQL queries.
- Sanitize and validate user inputs before using them in database queries.

This analysis indicates a serious SQL injection vulnerability with a straightforward attack vector.
