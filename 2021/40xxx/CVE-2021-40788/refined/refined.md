Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2021-40788:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference. This occurs when the program attempts to access a memory location via a pointer that has a NULL value.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to application denial of service. The application will likely crash when attempting to access the invalid memory location.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs to have some form of local access to the machine running the vulnerable software.
- The attack requires low complexity (AC:L), meaning the conditions for exploitation are easily met.
- No privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability (PR:N), so even a regular user can cause the denial of service.
- User interaction is required (UI:R). It's not specified what kind of interaction is needed but a user needs to perform some action.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the system with the vulnerable software installed.
- The attacker needs to trigger a specific action requiring user interaction that leads to the null pointer dereference.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information is more descriptive than the placeholder CVE description.
- The content includes the CVSS vector string which provides detailed information about the attack vector, complexity, privileges required and impact.
