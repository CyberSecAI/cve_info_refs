- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unauthenticated stored XSS in blog comments due to the lack of sanitization of the website field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website field of blog comments. When a user views the comment containing this script, it will be executed in the user's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other harmful actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the website field when creating or editing a blog comment. This field is not properly sanitized, so the script is stored in the database.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability. They only need the ability to create or edit blog comments.
