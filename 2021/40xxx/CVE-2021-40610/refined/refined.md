{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious websites, and other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "Multiple attack vectors are identified:\n    - Writing a malicious script in the article title field in the admin panel.\n    - Triggering the XSS via comments.\n    - Exploiting a vulnerability in the front-end of the application.\n    - Injecting XSS payloads into the system settings' footer information.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel of the application to inject XSS via the article title and system settings. For comments-based XSS, the attacker needs to be able to post a comment. The front-end XSS vector can potentially be triggered by any user interacting with the affected part of the application."
