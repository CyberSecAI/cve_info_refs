Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of validation of user-supplied input to a publicly accessible function within the `util.php` controller in Open-AudIT. Specifically, the `subnet_size` function.
*   The vulnerable code executes a shell command constructed using user-supplied data via the `$_POST['subnet']` variable. This is then passed directly to the `exec` function which executes a shell command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection, as the application directly uses user-provided data to construct and execute a shell command using `exec()`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting Open-AudIT.
*   **Full System Compromise:** This can potentially lead to complete control of the server. An attacker could use this to install malware, steal sensitive data, or disrupt the system operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious HTTP POST request with a crafted `subnet` parameter to the vulnerable `subnet_size` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Open-AudIT instance.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable without authentication. No user login is needed to perform the attack.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Open-AudIT versions 3.5.0 and later are affected.
*   **Patch:** A patch is available, which removes this vulnerability by validating the user input. The patch is present in the provided git commit:  `<https://github.com/Opmantek/open-audit/commit/1ce039306d85598880ff25fbeb20195ef3b7a993#diff-0d4f2e9612b02690fdeac430d36d1a8c334d6fb1e1d17c223cbfe5321b2bd04e>`.
*   **Severity:** The issue is rated as "Severe" due to its remote and unauthenticated nature.
