| Thanks for reporting your issue. Please make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your issue - thank you!   * I looked for a similar issue and couldn't find any. * I tried with the latest version of GPAC. Installers available at <http://gpac.io/downloads/gpac-nightly-builds/> * I give enough information for contributors to reproduce my issue (meaningful title, github labels, platform and compiler, command-line ...)   Step to reproduce:  ``` 1.get latest commit code (GPAC version 1.1.0-DEV-rev1216-gb39aa09c0-master) 2.compile with --enable-sanitizer 3.make 5 dirs which every of them has a large name(length=255), this makes the file's abs-path lengh larger than 1024, we called it large.nhml 4.run MP4Box -add {path to large.nhml} -new new.mp4  ```  Env: Ubunut 20.04 , clang 12.0.1  My cmd line an ASAN report MP4Box -add
