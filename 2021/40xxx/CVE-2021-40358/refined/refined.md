- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web server in affected systems does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname during legitimate file operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path Traversal (CWE-22) - Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could cause the pathname to resolve to a location outside of the restricted directory, leading to the ability to read, write, or delete critical files.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable webserver with a manipulated pathname. The attacker also requires low privileges (PR:L).
