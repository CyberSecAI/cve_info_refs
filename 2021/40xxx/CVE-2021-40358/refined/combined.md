Other SIMATIC Software Products

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 9.9

SUMMARY

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in SIMATIC WinCC that ultimately could allow local or remote attackers
to escalate privileges and read, write or delete critical ﬁles.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet
available.

Note: The vulnerability CVE-2021-40359 is part of a shared component, used by various Siemens
products (SIMATIC Communication Services - SCS). The installation of a ﬁx version of any product also
removes the vulnerability for other products on the same system, even if those products were not updated.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC NET PC software is a software product that is sold separately and implements the communica-
tions product from SIMATIC NET.

SIMATIC PCS 7 is a distributed control system (DCS) integrating SIMATIC WinCC, SIMATIC Batch,
SIMATIC Route Control, OpenPCS 7 and other components.

SIMATIC WinCC is a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-40358

Legitimate ﬁle operations on the web server of the affected systems do not properly neutralize special
elements within the pathname. An attacker could then cause the pathname to resolve to a location
outside of the restricted directory on the server and read, write or delete unexpected critical ﬁles.

(’Path Traversal’)

Vulnerability CVE-2021-40359

When downloading ﬁles, the affected systems do not properly neutralize special elements within the
pathname. An attacker could then cause the pathname to resolve to a location outside of the restricted
directory on the server and read unexpected critical ﬁles.
