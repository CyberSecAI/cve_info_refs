{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read when processing aperture macro outline primitives with multiple outline definitions. When multiple outline definitions are present in a macro, the code reuses the number of parameters calculated for the first outline, and when rendering it, reads from out-of-bounds memory because parameters for the second outline are bigger than expected.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds read",
    "Improper handling of exceptional conditions"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can achieve information disclosure by providing a specially-crafted Gerber file. This can lead to an attacker extracting sensitive data from the process memory.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious Gerber file. This file can be uploaded to a website that uses Gerbv to convert Gerber files into images. The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted aperture macro with multiple outline primitives.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious Gerber file to the vulnerable application."
