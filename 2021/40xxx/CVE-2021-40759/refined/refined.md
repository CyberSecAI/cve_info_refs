Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2021-40759:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer (CWE-788)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The vulnerability is classified as an "Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer". This indicates a flaw in how the application manages memory, leading to out-of-bounds access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution. This allows an attacker to execute malicious code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the current user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is local (AV:L). This means the attacker needs to have local access to the affected system, implying that they may need to get the malicious file or trigger onto the system first.
*   The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), meaning the user would need to open or interact with a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have a way to get a malicious file onto the victim's system. This could be done by socially engineering the user to open the file.
*   The attacker does not need special privileges (PR:N)
