Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-40438:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) issue in the `mod_proxy` module of the Apache HTTP Server. A crafted request URI path allows an attacker to control the destination server where the request is forwarded via `mod_proxy`.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The core vulnerability lies in the `mod_proxy` module not properly sanitizing or validating the target server specified in the crafted URI path.
-  **Improper Input Handling:** A crafted request URI path allows an attacker to cause mod_proxy to forward the request to an origin server chosen by the remote user, essentially abusing the proxy functionality.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to make the vulnerable server send requests to other internal systems or external services.
-  **Information Disclosure/NTLM hash theft (Windows):** On Windows systems, this SSRF can potentially leak NTLM hashes to a malicious server controlled by the attacker, using UNC paths.
- **Code execution/Source disclosure :** As a result of SSRF combined with improper escaping of output (CVE-2024-38475)  and  improper use of handlers (CVE-2024-38476), it is possible to map URLs to files on the system that are permitted to be served by the server, but are not intentionally directly reachable by any URL. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution or source code disclosure.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based attacks:**  Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Malicious request URI path:** The attack vector involves manipulating the URI path of an HTTP request to inject the target server address.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote attacker**: An attacker can be external to the target network.
- **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need any specific credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Crafted request:** The attacker needs to be able to send specific HTTP requests with a crafted URI path.
- **Vulnerable Server:** The attacker requires access to a server running an affected version of Apache HTTP Server with `mod_proxy` enabled, and potentially an exploitable backend application.

**Additional Details from the provided documents:**
*   **Cisco:** Cisco PSIRT became aware of exploitation attempts of CVE-2021-40438 in November 2021. Multiple Cisco products are affected and some fixes were made available in 2022.
*   **RedHat/Fedora:** Fedora 34 and 35 are affected and were patched in September of 2021.
*   **Tenable:** Tenable plugins have been created to detect the vulnerability in a variety of products.
*   **Apache:** The Apache HTTP Server project acknowledged the issue and released a fix in version 2.4.49 on September 16, 2021.

**Summary:**

The CVE-2021-40438 describes a critical SSRF vulnerability in the `mod_proxy` module of Apache HTTP Server. The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and allows attackers to redirect requests to arbitrary servers. This could potentially lead to information disclosure, NTLM hash theft, or code execution. Attackers require only the ability to send crafted network requests to a vulnerable server. This vulnerability was observed to be exploited in the wild. Patches and workarounds are available from vendors such as Apache, Cisco, RedHat, Oracle and others.
