The provided content relates to CVE-2021-40968.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input within the `templates/installer/step-004.inc.php` file. Specifically, the `username`, `newpassword1`, `newpassword2`, `firstname`, `lastname`, and `mail` parameters are not properly sanitized before being used within the HTML `value` attributes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the installer page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- This could lead to unauthorized actions, unauthorized access to data, stealing of session information, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing a JavaScript payload within the vulnerable parameters.
- The attacker then needs to trick a user into visiting this crafted URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL with the XSS payload in the vulnerable parameters.
- The attacker needs to coerce a victim user to visit this malicious link.
