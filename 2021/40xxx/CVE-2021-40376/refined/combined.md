Description:

CVE-2021-40376

“Update Manager”, a software component used by multiple otris

applications, e.g. otris Privacy, allows local users to escalate their

privileges  on  Windows  systems  to  SYSTEM,  by  exploiting  a

vulnerability  in  the  aforementioned  software,  which  runs  as  a

highly privileged Windows service.

“Update Manager” is a software component used by multiple otris applications, e.g. otris Privacy, to

manage  updates  of  their  software  on Windows  systems. The  software  component  is  installed  as  a

Windows service, and  is executed  with  the rights  of SYSTEM. The nature of the software requires

elevated privileges in order to install updates and/or add/remove programs.

The  affected  software  component  accepts  local  connections  via  .NET  named  pipes  and  remote

connections over HTTP port 9000 via WsHTTPBinding.

While examining the way “Update Manager” handles local connections over  .NET named pipes the

security researcher discovered a vulnerability, which would allow a local attacker (or an attacker logged

on remotely to the target machine) to escalate his privileges on the affected Windows machine to those

of SYSTEM.

The vulnerability can be exploited by connecting to the vulnerable component “Update Manager” via

.NET named pipes on the same target machine and issuing direct calls to available functions on the

exposed  interface,  which  are  processed  by  the  vulnerable  component  without  any  form  of  prior

authentication.

In  order  to  achieve  local  privilege  escalation,  different  approaches  exist.  In  hardened  corporate

environments, where executing MSI files is not allowed due to enforced policy restrictions, an attacker

can opt for overwriting the executables of any privileged Windows services or privileged  Scheduled

Task on paths not protected by Windows File Protection (WFP)1. For instance, attackers can opt to

overwrite  an  executable  located  under  (incl.  sub  folders)  “C:\Program  Files”  or  “C:\Program  Files

(x86)”. These paths are not protected by WFP and would facilitate the attack.

When  exploiting  the  vulnerability  by  opting  to  overwriting  an  executable  of  a  privileged  Windows

service or scheduled task, attackers need to overcome an obstacle. The “saveUpdateFiles” function

in the “UpdateProcessorClient” interface extracts attacker-controllable ZIP files to attacker-controllable

paths, however, the “ProductId” (an attacker-controllable GUID) in the “ProductDefinition” is padded

to the path where the ZIP file’s content are extracted. For example, an attacker who wish to overwrite

the

file

“C:\Target\Executable.exe”,  would

find

that

the  overwritten  path  becomes

“C:\Target\01234567-1234-5678-1234-0123456789123\Executable.exe”,  (where  “01234567-1234-

5678-1234-0123456789123” is an exemplary GUID), and that renders the attack useless. However,

attackers  can  facilitate  the  ZIP  Slip  Vulnerability2  and  prepare  a  malicious  ZIP  file  with  ZIP  entries

called “..”, which are used as part of the filename when preparing the path. When the extraction path

is

prepared,

the

overwritten

path

becomes

“C:\Target\01234567-1234-5678-1234-

0123456789123\..\Executable.exe”.

This was tested successfully against the “extractZipFile” function responsible for extracting ZIP files.

The vulnerability was found and exploited against production systems with active EDR and anti-virus

software; during a penetration test conducted by the security researcher.

Exploitation of this vulnerability remotely over WsHTTPBinding is not excluded and should be further

investigated.
