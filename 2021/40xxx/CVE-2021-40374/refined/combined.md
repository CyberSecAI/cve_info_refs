# CVE-2021-40374 - Stored Cross-site Scripting in OpenEyes 3.5.1

## Description

A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in OpenEyes 3.5.1, developed by the Apperta Foundation.

Improper input handling in the 'Address1' parameter allowed for JavaScript to be injected into a patients profile. When the patient profile was loaded by the web browser, the JavaScript executed. This could be used to perform XSS attacks on unsuspecting users who view the patient profile.

## Reproduction

1. Browse to a patient profile.
2. Click the 'edit icon' near the top of the screen.
3. In the Address1 field, input the following JavaScript: `<IMG SRC=# onerror="alert('xxs')">`
4. Click 'Save patient'.
5. Reload the patient profile.
6. Note that an alert box is triggered by the browser with the message 'xss'.

## Impact

If an attacker were to embed malicious JavaScript into the OpenEyes application, it could be used to hijack user accounts, steal credentials, exfiltrate sensitive data or perform malicious actions on the OpenEyes application.

## Demonstration

XSS.mp4

OpenEyes is the leading open source electronic patient record (EPR) for ophthalmology. It has been designed by clinicians to be fast in delivering content, fast to navigate and easy (and fun) to use. We benefit from a large and growing body of enthusiastic clinicians determined to make OpenEyes the EPR that will help you deliver data-driven patient care in the best way possible. OpenEyes is owned by the community and not by any individual or corporate entity. It can be customised to suit local needs and will scale to connect, seamlessly, primary and secondary eye care.

## OpenEyes the leading open source EPR for Ophthalmology

---

OpenEyes is an electronic patient record application for ophthalmology, developed with contributions from a range of hospitals, institutions, academic departments, companies and individuals. Intuitive to use and fast, it runs in a web browser to ensure that it can be accessed from just about any device in any location. OpenEyes will always be available free-of-charge under an open source license, making it a cost-effective option for eye care, and, perhaps more importantly, ensuring that its development will always prioritise what clincians really need.

While OpenEyes can be downloaded and used free of charge anywhere in the world, we recommend that installations in a clinical environment are handled through our authorised professional services network. One of our professional services partners ToukanLabs, can provide advice and pricing on accredited implementation and support services.

Our partners will ensure that your clinical data integrates with hospital workflows and PAS system and that the connections to devices such as OCT machines or visual field devices are robust.

All users of OpenEyes can become members of our development community, participating in online and offline discussions to identify and prioritise the OpenEyes development roadmap. To learn more about membership, please call 0300 030 1973 or email us at openeyes@apperta.org  and for a more detailed look at OpenEyes, click the button below.

* Supporting and growing the OpenEyes community
* Prioritise and commission OpenEyes development
* As copyright and IP owner, publishing the source code
* Growing the accredited professional services partner network
* Assuring OpenEyes for DCB0129 compliance

Continuing this development as a not for profit body is an essential part of our collaborative, public service ethos. OpenEyes cannot, in itself, be sold to a third party ensuring that users have security and can influence development. The OpenEyes community manage the design and development of future versions of OpenEyes in response to feedback.
