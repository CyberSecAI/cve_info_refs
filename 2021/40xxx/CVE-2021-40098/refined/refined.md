- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Path traversal vulnerability via external form.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) through an external form.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs via a path traversal vulnerability in an external form.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted request via an external form.
