The provided content contains information about CVE-2021-40970.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of user-controlled parameters within the installation process of Spotweb. Specifically, the `username`, `newpassword1`, `newpassword2`, `firstname`, `lastname`, and `mail` parameters in the `templates/installer/step-004.inc.php` file are not properly sanitized when displayed, leading to a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the installer page (step-004.inc.php). The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input before rendering it in HTML.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed within the victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable page. This can lead to:
- Unauthorized actions being performed
- Unauthorized access to data
- Stealing of session information
- Denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted HTTP POST requests to the `install.php` page with a `page` parameter set to 4. Malicious JavaScript code is injected via the vulnerable parameters (`username`, `newpassword1`, `newpassword2`, `firstname`, `lastname`, or `mail`) within the POST data. The injected code is then reflected back in the HTML of the installer page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload embedded in the POST data, and then coerce a user (likely an administrator setting up the application) to access the installation page through this URL (e.g. through social engineering). The attacker does not need to be authenticated to trigger this vulnerability during the installation phase.
