  "description": "Multiple os command injection vulnerabilities exist in the device network settings functionality of reolink RLC-410W v3.0.0.136_20121102. A specially-crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. The `device` program is responsible for taking the change, through the APIs, and applying those into the system. These change are implemented using OS commands. Because these inputs are not validated properly, this lead to OS command injections.",

      {
        "type": "OS Command Injection",
        "location": "SetDdns API, password parameter",
        "description": "The `ddns->password` variable, which is the value of the `password` parameter provided through the `SetDdns` API, is not validated properly. This allows for OS command injection via the `pip_system` function."
