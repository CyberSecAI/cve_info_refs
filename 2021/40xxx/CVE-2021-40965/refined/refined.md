**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Knowledge of Target System:** The attacker needs to know about the target's TinyFileManager instance.
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker must be able to trick an administrator user.
*   **Web Server Access:** The attacker does not need direct access to the web server but requires the ability to make an administrator browse a crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in TinyFileManager versions up to and including 2.4.6.
*   The attacker can upload files to the server.
*   The attacker can execute OS commands by tricking the administrator.
