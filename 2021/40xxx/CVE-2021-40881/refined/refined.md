The content relates to CVE-2021-40881.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The parameters of planned tasks are controllable, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uncontrolled parameters are passed to the default bat script which will be executed by the system.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution (RCE) can be achieved by manipulating the parameters.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered via the "planned tasks" functionality within the application's admin interface at `/publiccms/admin/#site_sysSite/script`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to access the application's admin panel to modify the planned tasks, and then exploit the injection vulnerability.
