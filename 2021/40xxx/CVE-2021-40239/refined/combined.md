### **[H4niz](/H4niz)** commented [Aug 24, 2021](#issue-978354828)

| Hi [@Gabe-commiter](https://github.com/Gabe-commiter), I found a issue, that can trigger buffer overflow on your application. The issue exists on `do_retr()` function (from line 706 to 791) on ftpproto.c  At glance, we can see you defined `char arg[MAX_ARG];` , it's not problem, however, when you use `sprintf()` on line 718 and 721, they trigger bufferoverflow.  ``` typedef struct session { /* 	Defined on common.h 		#define MAX_COMMAND_LINE 1024 		#define MAX_COMMAND 32 		#define MAX_ARG     1024  		#define MAX_BUFFER_SIZE 1024 */  #define MAX_BUFFER_SIZE 1024 	uid_t    uid; 	int ctrl_fd;//¿ØÖÆÃèÊö·û 	char cmdline[MAX_COMMAND_LINE]; 	char cmd[MAX_COMMAND]; 	char arg[MAX_ARG];  .... 	<truncated> .... }session_t;  ```  ``` static void do_retr(session_t *sess) { 	<truncated> .... 	char buf[MAX_BUFFER_SIZE] = {0}; // Defined buffer called buf with MAX_BUFFER_SIZE length 	//2ÅÐ¶Ï´«ÊäÄ£Ê½ 	if(sess->is_ascii) // trigger the buffer overflow because length of sess->arg is defined 1024 length,  // in order that, when sprintf is executed, the buffer `buf` can be write total  len("Opening ASCII mode data connection for ") + MAX_BUFFER_SIZE + len(" (%ld bytes)") 		sprintf(buf,  "Opening ASCII mode data connection for %s (%ld bytes)", sess->arg, sbuf.st_size);//Ascii 	else // trigger the buffer overflow because length of sess->arg is defined 1024 length,  // in order that, when sprintf is executed, the buffer `buf` can be write total  len("Opening ASCII mode data connection for ") + MAX_BUFFER_SIZE + len(" (%ld bytes)") 		sprintf(buf, "Opening BINARY mode data connection for %s (%ld bytes)", sess->arg, sbuf.st_size); ... 	<truncated> ... }  ```  **Solution**: Please use `snprintf()` to limit maximum input characters. See: <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/snprintf-c-library/> |
