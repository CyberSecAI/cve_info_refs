- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `sauvePass` action in `central.php` uses `file_put_contents()` to write the username to `password.php` without proper sanitization of special characters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient input sanitization when writing the username to the password.php file. Specifically, the lack of filtering of characters like `'`, `"`, `;`, `()`, etc.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution (RCE). An attacker can inject malicious PHP code into the `password.php` file by manipulating the username field during the password change process.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability through the password change functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the password change functionality of CMSUno. They must be able to submit a username with malicious php code.
