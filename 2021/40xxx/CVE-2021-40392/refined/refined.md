- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Moxa MXView web application transmits credentials in cleartext by default.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can sniff network traffic and obtain sensitive information, such as login credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: Network sniffing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to sniff network traffic, for example, being on the same network as the vulnerable application. The attacker also needs to be able to capture and inspect the network packets being transmitted by the application.
