The provided content is related to CVE-2021-40367.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DICOM files within the *syngo* fastView application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability (CWE-787). This occurs because the application does not sufficiently validate the size and content of the DICOM file being processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
- A crash of the application.
- Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a malicious DICOM file with the vulnerable *syngo* fastView application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to:
1.  Create a malicious DICOM file.
2.  Convince the user to open the malicious file with the *syngo* fastView application.
The attacker does not need any special privileges or to be on the same network as the victim.
