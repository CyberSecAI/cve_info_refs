- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stemmed from the ability for an admin user to change another user's password without needing to re-authenticate, providing an avenue for unauthorized modifications.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper re-authentication checks when an admin user changes another user's password. This allowed for password modification without the admin re-entering their password, creating a potential security vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who has gained administrative access could change any user's password without providing their own password. This would lead to a loss of confidentiality and integrity of affected user accounts.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the Concrete CMS dashboard.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator to exploit this vulnerability.
