### Bug Description

Currently when a token based websesrvice is called it authenticates the owner of the token on the Mahara end so that any functions called by the service can only be executed if the authenticated token owner can run those functions.

One of the problems with the current setup is we don't then kill the session of this token owner when the webservice call is completed.

This means if one hits a site with a crafted URL containing a valid token but no webservice function they will get an error message page, but if they then go to the home page of the site they will find they are logged in as the token owner.

In the webservice\_base\_server class there is the run() method that goes through the steps to do a webservice call and the last part is calling $this->session\_cleanup();

And in that method is nothing to actually handle the logging out of that session

Vulnerability type: Insecure permissions

Attack type: Remote

Impact: Information disclosure, escalation of privileges

Affected components: A token-based web service authenticates the owner of the token so that functions called by the web service can only be executed if the authenticated token owner can run those functions. However, the session of this token is not ended when the web service call throws an error. This means if you try to access a site with a crafted URL containing a valid token but no web service function, there will be an error message page, and if you then go to the homepage of the site, you will be logged in as the token owner.

Suggested description: In Mahara before 20.04.5, 20.10.3, 21.04.2, and 21.10.0, the account associated with a web services token is vulnerable to being exploited and logged into, resulting in information disclosure at minimum and often escalation of privileges.

## Create portfolios

Using Mahara, students and staff create their personal learning stories by uploading evidence of activities they have participated in, and embedding publicly accessible content they have previously put online. They can write reflections on their experiences that frame this evidence, map it to competencies or registration requirements, and provide necessary context.

Mahara can be used for many different portfolio purposes, such as study, professional development, work-integrated learning, assessment, showcase and presentation, and employability.

## Share work

Mahara allows portfolios to be shared flexibly with one person, a specific group of people, or the entire world. Access can be further restricted to a particular time frame or just within an assessment task.

Vulnerability type: Insecure permissions
Attack type: Remote
Impact: Information disclosure, escalation of privileges

Affected components: A token-based web service authenticates the owner of the token so that functions called by the web service can only be executed if the authenticated token owner can run those functions. However, the session of this token is not ended when the web service call throws an error. This means if you try to access a site with a crafted URL containing a valid token but no web service function, there will be an error message page, and if you then go to the homepage of the site, you will be logged in as the token owner.

Description: In Mahara before 20.04.5, 20.10.3, 21.04.2, and 21.10.0, the account associated with a web services token is vulnerable to being exploited and logged into, resulting in information disclosure at minimum and often escalation of privileges.
