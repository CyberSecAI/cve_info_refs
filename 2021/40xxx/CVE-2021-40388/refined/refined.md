- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect default permissions on the installation directory of Advantech SQ Manager Server, specifically allowing the "Everyone" group "Full" control over service binaries, including executables and libraries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The service binaries located within the installation directory have insecure permissions allowing any user to modify them. The services run with `NETWORK SERVICE` privileges and possess `SeImpersonatePrivilege` allowing privilege escalation to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can replace legitimate service binaries with malicious ones, causing the service to execute the attacker's code with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges. This allows the attacker complete control over the system.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can replace the service binaries and DLL files located within the installation directory with malicious versions. The attacker must then restart the service for the attack to execute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system to replace the files, and must be able to restart the vulnerable service.
