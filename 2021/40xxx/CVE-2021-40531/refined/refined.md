Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-40531:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a combination of factors in how Sketch (a macOS UI/UX design application) handles library feeds and downloaded files:
  *   **Unrestricted File Transfer:** Sketch allows any type of URL to be specified in the library feed's "enclosure" tag, without protocol restrictions or content type validation.
  *   **Quarantine Bypass:** Prior to Sketch 75, downloaded files from library feeds were not marked with the "com.apple.quarantine" extended attribute, bypassing macOS's security mechanism.
  *   **Automatic File Opening:** After downloading a file from a library feed, Sketch automatically opens the file without any user interaction or prompt.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
  *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate the URL in the "enclosure" tag.
  *   **Missing Quarantine Attribute:** Sketch fails to set the quarantine attribute for downloaded files.
  *   **Automatic Execution:** Files are opened automatically post-download, without user confirmation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The combined vulnerabilities enable a remote code execution (RCE) attack. An attacker can craft a malicious library feed containing a URL pointing to a specially crafted file (e.g., a Terminal profile) that, when opened, executes arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

  *   **Malicious Library Feed:** The primary attack vector is a maliciously crafted library feed.
  *   **URL Handler:** Sketch registers a URL handler (`sketch://add-library?url=<LIBRARY_FEED_URL>`) that, when clicked, automatically initiates the library installation process (and download/execution of the malicious payload)
  *   **User Interaction (Minimal):** The victim needs only to click a crafted link or use the crafted library feed within Sketch.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

  *   **Ability to Host a Malicious File:** The attacker needs to host a malicious file (e.g., a crafted `.terminal` profile) accessible via a URL.
  *   **Ability to Create a Malicious Library Feed:** The attacker needs to craft a minimal RSS feed that points to the malicious file.
  *   **Social Engineering (Optional but helpful):**  The attacker needs to entice the victim to click on a crafted link or use the library feed.

**Technical Details:**

  *   Sketch versions prior to 75 are vulnerable.
  *   The vulnerability is demonstrated with a Terminal profile file (.terminal) that includes an embedded command to open Calculator.app for demonstration purposes. This highlights that arbitrary code execution is possible.
  *  The exploit can be delivered with just one click using the custom URL handler.

**Mitigation:**
  *   Sketch version 75 and later appropriately quarantine downloaded files from library feeds.
