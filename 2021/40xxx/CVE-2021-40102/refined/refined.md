- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization when processing user-supplied data, allowing for PHAR deserialization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary file deletion via PHAR deserialization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could delete arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to data loss or disruption of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves exploiting the PHAR deserialization vulnerability through a crafted PHAR archive.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to provide a malicious PHAR file to the system through some interface.
