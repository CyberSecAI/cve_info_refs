# Gibbon - The Flexible School Platform

Created by teachers, Gibbon is the school platform which

solves real problems encountered by educators every day.

Being free, open source and flexible Gibbon can morph

to meet the needs of a huge range of schools.

### Student Centred

Gibbon collates student information, helping teachers to understand, contact, find and help their students.

### Teacher Led

Gibbon is built by teachers to solve problems common to all schools, allowing seamless planning, teaching and assessment.

### Unified Access

Teachers, students, parents and administrators all access Gibbon from the same web-based platform, with highly configurable levels of access.

### Free & Flexible

Gibbon is free, open source software: its flexible design gives schools complete control and freedom.

## A Global Platform

Gibbon is used by many different schools around the world, including international schools, public schools, home schools, and refugee schools.

We’re creating a map of schools to discover where and how Gibbon is being used. Visit the map to learn more and feel free to add your school to the map.

[Add your School](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1EeVmGylyL_WcC94A8NuVv3MxBgt616V3Wq_EwVaFILY/edit?usp=sharing "Add your School")

## Multilingual

Gibbon speaks many languages! The core is available in 22
actively-translated languages, with many more in the works. It also provides support for right-to-left text and UTF-8 encoding.

Our language options are made possible by the many volunteers who have worked to translate Gibbon into their language. Learn more about our [available languages](about/#languages) and [collaborative translation tools](about/#languages).

## Created by Educators, for Educators

The workflows in Gibbon have been designed in a school, based on feedback from the people using it everyday.

### Free

Gibbon aims aim to provide all schools, no matter their size or resources they have, with the systems they need for effective learning, teaching and school management.

### Open Source

As an open source platform, Gibbon enables schools to host on their own servers, backup, redistribute and modify the software as needed.

### Flexible

Right from the beginning, Gibbon was designed to be flexible, extensible and themeable, whilst aiming to help teachers to do their jobs.
