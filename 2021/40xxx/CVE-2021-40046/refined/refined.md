- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a module failing to fully verify external input, which allows attackers to perform malicious operations to obtain higher permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege escalation due to insufficient validation of external input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to access resources beyond their privilege, which could include sensitive information or system control.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker sends a crafted message to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send a crafted message to the affected system.
