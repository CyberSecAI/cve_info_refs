- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application displays user-controlled parameter `cid` from the request without sufficient sanitization. Specifically, the code at `Detector/web/templates/_contactform.inc.php` line 22 uses `<?=$_REQUEST['cid']?>` which directly outputs the `cid` parameter value into the HTML context without any encoding or sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to unauthorized actions, unauthorized access to data, stealing of session information, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `cid` parameter and coercing a user to visit it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and entice a victim to click on it.
