Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with LiveConfig 2.12.2:

**1. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** Missing output encoding of search results.
*   **Weakness:**  The application fails to sanitize or encode user-supplied data before displaying it within the search results page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing cookies)
    *   Defacement of the web page
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Data theft
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   An attacker with Administrator or Reseller privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code through customer data fields (e.g., name, notes).
    *   When a user with appropriate permissions searches for the customer with the injected script, the script will execute in their browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Administrator or Reseller account with access to customer data.

**2. Path Traversal**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper input sanitization/validation when handling log file paths.
*   **Weakness:** The application does not adequately validate user-supplied input for file paths, enabling an attacker to navigate to arbitrary directories within the server's file system.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server that they would not normally have access to, potentially including configuration files, application source code, etc.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   An authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability through the `/liveconfig/hosting/webspace` component, likely through manipulating request parameters or other inputs when requesting log files.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Valid user account.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Both vulnerabilities were reported to the vendor and fixed in LiveConfig version 2.13.0.
*   The information provided by mgm security partners is more detailed than a typical CVE description, providing specific affected components, attack types, and impact information.
