Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-40153:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `unsquashfs` utility in `squashfs-tools` does not properly validate filepaths extracted from Squashfs images. Specifically, it fails to check for directory traversal sequences (`..`) in filenames within directory entries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of validation of filenames during the extraction process. The `squashfs_opendir` function in `unsquash-1.c` (and similar functions in other versions of unsquash) directly uses the stored filename to create files on the target system, without verifying for path traversal characters.
*   **Unvalidated filenames:** The filename stored in the squashfs image can contain `..` and `/` which can be used to write files outside the intended destination.
*   **Insecure file creation:** `unsquashfs` prepends file data to existing files, or creates the file+path if it does not exist, without proper sanitization of the target path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can craft a malicious Squashfs image that, when extracted using a vulnerable `unsquashfs`, will write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem.
*   **Code Execution:** By overwriting critical system files like `/etc/crontab`, an attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.
*   **Data Overwrite:** Files outside of the intended destination can be overwritten with arbitrary content from the squashfs image.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Squashfs Image:** The attack vector involves an attacker creating a specially crafted Squashfs image with filepaths designed to write to arbitrary locations.
*   **User Interaction:** A user must then use the vulnerable `unsquashfs` to extract the malicious image.
*  **Symlink Vulnerability:** As discovered later, the vulnerability can also be exploited using specially crafted squashfs images that contain symbolic links along with a duplicate named file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Squashfs Images:** An attacker must be able to create or modify Squashfs images. This can be achieved using a modified `mksquashfs` tool or by manipulating the filesystem metadata.
*   **Victim Execution:** The attacker must trick the victim to use the vulnerable `unsquashfs` utility to extract the malicious Squashfs image.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was initially addressed by commit `79b5a55`, which added checks for invalid characters like `/`, `.` and `..` in file names.
*   A subsequent issue was found where symlinks and duplicate file names could also lead to writing outside the destination directory, fixed by commit `e048580`, that explicitly checks for duplicate filenames within a directory
*   A separate CVE, CVE-2021-41072, was assigned for the symlink issue.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions of squashfs-tools before 4.5
*   Multiple Linux distributions (Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu, Gentoo) have released security patches to address this issue.
