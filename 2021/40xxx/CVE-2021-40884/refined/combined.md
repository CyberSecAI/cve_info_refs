| Dear [@ignacionelson](https://github.com/ignacionelson), [@kwadrat](https://github.com/kwadrat) , I have found an IDOR vulnerability in `Files` function. Description Because of not checking authorization at `ids` parameter in `files-edit.php` and `id` parameter in `process.php`, The user with uploader role can `download`,`edit` all files of users in application To ReproduceDownload file  1. Access url `/process.php?do=download&id=` url 2. Add value for `id` parameter from `1` -> `...` to download all files in application    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54875703/132287142-1b11b727-dad5-4633-87e0-d66e2bcbe405.png)  Edit File  1. Access url `/files-edit.php?ids=` 2. Add value for id parameter from `1` -> `...` to edit all files in application    Files of user `kietna` on application    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54875703/132287331-e6a18fdd-c9d2-47ae-92e9-c342cfafa309.png)    User `kietna` edit private file of `admin` user    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54875703/132287385-d4f0be4b-ba38-4a88-9dd5-bf8f4a823e4c.png)    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54875703/132287414-60882fa6-89a4-494e-ac64-9e9bcc84771d.png)    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54875703/132287506-e0817f7a-16d0-4b1d-93c5-2b91a2d384e0.png)  Solution You need to check authorization for `id` and `ids` parameters, make sure that a user on the system can only interact with that user's files |
