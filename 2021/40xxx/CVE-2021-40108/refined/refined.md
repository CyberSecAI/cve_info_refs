- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient verification of the `ccm_token` on the `/index.php/ccm/calendar/dialogs/event/add/save` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery). The endpoint was vulnerable to CSRF because it didn't properly verify the `ccm_token`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially perform unauthorized actions on the calendar by crafting a malicious request.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a crafted malicious request from a different site that is sent to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into sending a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint.
