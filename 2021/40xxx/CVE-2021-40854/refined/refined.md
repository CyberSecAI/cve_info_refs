- Root cause of vulnerability: Opening the chat log through the UI launches Notepad with escalated privileges.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper privilege handling when opening the chat log, allowing for privilege escalation.
- Impact of exploitation: A local user with restricted privileges can gain administrator privileges by using the "File -> Open..." dialog in the escalated Notepad process.
- Attack vectors: Local user interaction with the AnyDesk UI. Specifically, clicking the "Open Chat Log" link after accepting a connection.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: A local user with restricted privileges who has an active AnyDesk connection. The attacker must have access to the machine where AnyDesk is running and be able to interact with the UI.
