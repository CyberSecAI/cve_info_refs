Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security\_vulnerability\_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n Fixed Releases\r\nCustomers are advised to take appropriate actions as indicated in the following table:\r\n Cisco Policy Suite Software Release Vulnerability status Remediation action Earlier than 20.2.0 Vulnerable Upgrade to 21.1.0. 20.2.0 Vulnerable Contact TAC to get a patch installed. 21.1.0 Vulnerable Change the default SSH keys. 21.2.0 and later Not vulnerable See footnote 1\r\n1. Releases 21.2.0 and later will automatically create new SSH keys during installation but not during an upgrade. If a device is upgraded from 21.1.0, the keys should still be changed by using the following procedure.\r\n Change the Default SSH Keys\r\nTo generate new SSH keys and propagate them to all the machines in the deployment, follow these steps:\r\n\r\nStep 1\r\n\r\nTo generate new keys, execute the following command on installer VM (Cluster Manager):\r\n\r\n\r\n/var/qps/install/current/scripts/bin/support/manage\_sshkey.sh --create\r\n\r\nStep 2\r\n\r\nUpdate keys on CPS VMs and installer VM (Cluster Manager):\r\n\r\n\r\n/var/qps/install/current/scripts/bin/support/manage\_sshkey.sh --update\r\n\r\nThis procedure is documented in CPS Migration and Upgrade Guide, Release 21.1.0 [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/quantum-policy-suite/R21-1-0/CPS21-1-0MigrationandUpgradeGuide/CPS18-0-0MigrationandUpgradeGuide\_1\_chapter\_01.html#task\_m3s\_mhk\_r4b\"].\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory."

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |

| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed).

| **Additional Public Relations** | media\_pr@cisco.com |

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## In-Service Migration to 21.1.0

This section describes the steps to perform an In-Service Software Migration (ISSM) of a CPS 19.4.0/CPS 19.5.0 to CPS 21.1.0.
This migration allows the traffic to continue running while the migration is being performed.

| **Important** | ---   CPS 19.5.0 was a Limited Availability release with user restrictions.   --- |
| --- | --- |

In-service software migrations to CPS 21.1.0 are supported only for Mobile (HA) and GR installations. Other CPS installation
types cannot be migrated.

| **Note** | ---   Before migration, you need to configure at least one Graphite/Grafana user. Grafana supports Graphite data source credential configuration capability. Graphite data source requires common data source credential to be configured using Grafana for Grafana user. Data source credential must be configured before migration. If you fail to add the user, then Grafana will not have an access to Graphite database and you will get continuous prompts for Graphite/Grafana credentials.  All Grafana users configured will be available after migration. However, you need to configure the graphite data source in Grafana UI.  Synchronize the Grafana information between the OAM (pcrfclient) VMs by running `grafana_sync.sh` script from pcrfclient01.  For more information on updating graphite data source, see Configuring Graphite User Credentials in Grafana in CPS Operations Guide.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   In CPS 21.1.0, additional application and platform statistics are enabled. Hence, there can be an increase in the disk space usage at pcrfclient VMs. Once CPS 21.1.0 is deployed, monitor the disk space usage and if required, increase the disk space.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Prerequisites

| **Important** | ---  During the migration process, do not make policy configuration changes, CRD table updates, or other system configuration changes. These type of changes should only be performed after the migration has been successfully completed and properly validated.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   During migration, the value of Session Limit Overload Protection under System configuration in Policy Builder can be set to 0 (default) which indefinitely accepts all the messages so that the traffic is not impacted but SNMP traps are raised. Once migration is complete, you must change the value as per the session capacity of the setup and publish it without restarting the Policy Server (QNS) process. For more information, contact your Cisco Account representative.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Before beginning the migration:

1. Create a backup (snapshot/clone) of the Cluster Manager VM following the guidelines of the prior release. If errors occur
   during the migration process, this backup is required to successfully roll back the migration. For more information refer
   to CPS Backup and Restore Guide.
2. Back up any nonstandard customizations or modifications to system files. Only customizations which are made to the configuration
   files on the Cluster Manager are backed up. Refer to the CPS Installation Guide for
   VMware for an example of this customization procedure. Any customizations which are made directly to the CPS VMs must be reapplied
   manually after the migration is complete.
3. Remove any previously installed patches.

   | **Note** | ---   Before removing the patches, contact your Cisco Technical Representative.   --- |
   | --- | --- |
4. If necessary, upgrade the underlying hypervisor before performing the CPS in-service software migration. The steps to upgrade
   the hypervisor or troubleshoot any issues that may arise during the hypervisor upgrade is beyond the scope of this document.
   Refer to the CPS Installation Guide for
   VMware for a list of supported hypervisors for this CPS release.

   | **Note** | ---   As CPS 21.1.0 is built on a newer version of CentOS 8.1 which supports ESXi 6.7, make sure OVF tool version 4.3.0 is installed in CPS 19.4.0/CPS 19.5.0 from where you are migrating.  Version 4.3.0 for VMware 6.5/6.7: VMware-ovftool-4.3.0-13981069-lin.x86\_64.bundle  <https://code.vmware.com/web/tool/4.3.0/ovf>   --- |
   | --- | --- |

   | **Important** | ---   CPS 19.5.0 was a Limited Availability release with user restrictions.   --- |
   | --- | --- |
5. Verify that the Cluster Manager VM has at least 10 GB of free space. The Cluster Manager VM requires this space when it creates
   the backup archive at the beginning of the migration process.
6. Synchronize the Grafana information between the OAM (pcrfclient) VMs by running the following command from pcrfclient01:

   `/var/qps/bin/support/grafana_sync.sh`

   Also verify that the `/var/broadhop/.htpasswd` files are the same on pcrfclient01 and pcrfclient02 and copy the file from pcrfclient01 to pcrfclient02 if necessary.

   Refer to Copy Dashboards and Users to pcrfclient02 in the CPS Operations
   Guide for more information.
7. Check the health of the CPS cluster as described in [Check the System Health](#id_11108).
8. The following logs must be enabled/set to debug before starting ISSM in logback.xml file.

   ```
   <logger name="com.broadhop.utilities.zmq.upgrade.ZMQInServiceUpgradeMgr" level="debug"/>
   ```

   Once ISSM is complete, remove the entry from logback.xml file.
9. The contents of logback.xml file are overwritten during an upgrade or a migration. Make sure to update the logback.xml file as per your requirements after an upgrade or a migration.
10. If you are using IPv6 address, make sure the address you are using is in uncompressed format before starting the migration.

    For example,

    IPv6 in uncompressed format: 2345:f170:8306:8118:e0:208:0:100

Refer also to [Rollback Considerations](#id_27053) for more information about the process to restore a CPS cluster to the previous version if the migration is not successful.

| **Note** | ---   Cisco Smart Licensing is supported for CPS 10.0.0 and later releases. For information about Smart Licensing and how to enable it for CPS, refer to the CPS Operations Guide.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Overview

The In-Service Software Migration (ISSM) is performed in the following general steps:

1. Download and mount the CPS software on the Cluster Manager VM.
2. Migrate the Cluster Manager VM – Relevant data is backed up from the old Cluster Manager VM in addition to the other CPS VMs,
   and stored in a tar file. Then the old Cluster Manager can be terminated and brought back up with the new 21.1.0 base image
   and the same IP address from the old Cluster Manager. The backed up data is then restored on the new Cluster Manager.

   | **Note** | ---   Graphite data source in Grafana needs to be updated to use configured Graphite/Grafana user credentials before upgrade/migrate start or after fresh installation. If you fail to add this, you will get continuous prompt for Graphite/Grafana credentials as Grafana does not have access to Graphite database.  Synchronize the Grafana information between the OAM (pcrfclient) VMs by running `grafana_sync.sh` script from pcrfclient01.   --- |
   | --- | --- |
3. Migrate CPS VMs Set 1 – The rest of the CPS VMs are split in half. The first set of CPS VMs, Set 1, can then be terminated
   and brought back up with the new 21.1.0 base image. The new VMs are then enabled and restored with the relevant data that
   was backed up.
4. Migrate CPS VMs Set 2 – After the first set of CPS VMs have been brought back up, the second set are then terminated and brought
   back up using the 21.1.0 base image. The new CPS VMs are then enabled and restored with the relevant data that was backed
   up.

## Check the System Health

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Log in to the Cluster Manager VM as the root user. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Check the health of the system by running the following command:  `diagnostics.sh`  Clear or resolve any errors or warnings before proceeding. |

---

## Download the CPS ISO Image

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Download the Full Cisco Policy Suite Installation software package (ISO image) from software.cisco.com. Refer to CPS Release Notes for the download link. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Load the ISO image on the Cluster Manager.  For example:  `wget http://linktoisomage/CPS_x.x.x.release.iso`  where,  `linktoisoimage` is the link to the website from where you can download the ISO image.  `CPS_x.x.x.release.iso` is the name of the Full Installation ISO image. |

---

## Create a Backup of CPS 19.4.0/19.5.0 Cluster Manager

Before migrating Cluster Manager to CPS 21.1.0, create a backup of the current Cluster Manager in case an issue occurs during
migration.

| **Important** | ---   CPS 19.5.0 was a Limited Availability release with user restrictions.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | On Cluster Manager, remove the following files if they exist:  ``` * /etc/udev/rules.d/65-cps-ifrename.rules * /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules ``` |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | After removing the files, reboot the Cluster Manager. |
| **Step 3** | Create a backup (snapshot/clone) of Cluster Manager. For more information, refer to the CPS Backup and Restore Guide. |

---

## Migrate the Cluster Manager VM

This section describes how to migrate the Cluster Manager VM to CPS 21.1.0.

| **Note** | ---   Diagnostic fails during migration. This is normal since NTP may be converging, mongo replica sets are not synced, and so on. If you see HAProxy diagnostics warnings about Diameter endpoints being down, see [HAProxy Diagnostics Warnings](#id_47389) for a workaround.   --- |
| --- | --- |

For VMware based setup, check Configuration.csv under /var/qps/config/deploy/csv/ and confirm whether `db_authentication_enabled` parameter is present in the file. For migration to succeed, `db_authentication_enabled,FALSE,` must be configured in Configuration.csv file.

* The migration succeeds:

  + If `db_authentication_enabled` is disabled as `db_authentication_enabled,FALSE,` OR the parameter is enabled as `db_authentication_enabled,TRUE,`
  + db\_authentication\_admin\_passwd,<xxxxxxx>,
  + db\_authentication\_readonly\_passwd,<xxxxx>,
* If the parameter `db_authentication_enabled` is not present in the file, you need to configure it as `db_authentication_enabled,FALSE,` for migration to succeed.

This is mongo authentication related feature. For more information, see CPS Installation Guide for
VMware.

The following logback files are overwritten with latest files after ISSM. Any modification done to these files, needs to merge
mannually after migration is complete:

```
/etc/broadhop/logback-debug.xml
/etc/broadhop/logback-netcut.xml
/etc/broadhop/logback-pb.xml
/etc/broadhop/logback.xml
/etc/broadhop/controlcenter/logback.xml
```

Backup of old logback.xml files is available at /var/tmp/logback\_backup on newly deployed Cluster Manager VM after running `restore_cluman.py` script. Same files are also available in migrate\_cluman\_\*.tar.gz generated in [Step 4](#t_migratecluman_2110__step_B3C9E6BD0D124F60BFDFE9CD3B8BEDE4).

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Unmount the old CPS ISO by running the following command:  `umount /mnt/iso` |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Mount the new CPS 21.1.0 ISO to the existing CPS Cluster Manager running the following command:  `mount -o loop CPS_x.x.x.release.iso /mnt/iso` |
| **Step 3** | Back up the Cluster Manager by running the following command:  `/mnt/iso/migrate.sh backup cluman`  After the backup has run successfully, you should see messages like the following:  ```  2018-07-14 02:39:07,842 INFO [backup.etc] Backup: etc 2018-07-14 02:39:07,878 INFO [__main__.run_recipe] Performing installation stage: Create backup Tar 2018-07-14 02:39:07,905 INFO [__main__.<module>] ===================== 2018-07-14 02:39:07,905 INFO [__main__.<module>]  SUCCESS 2018-07-14 02:39:07,905 INFO [__main__.<module>] ======== END ========  ```  | **Important** | Back up any nonstandard customization or modifications to system files and configuration files that are not a part of the default configuration (`/etc/broadhop/`). | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | After the Cluster Manager data has been backed up, copy the tar.gz file to an external location or control node as shown in the following example:  **For example:**  ``` sftp root@172.16.2.19 sftp> get migrate_cluman_20180105_170515.tar.gz Fetching /var/tmp/migrate_cluman_20170105_170515.tar.gz to migrate_20170105_170515.tar.gz /var/tmp/migrate_cluman_20180105_170515.tar.gz  ```  In this example, 172.16.2.19 is the internal IP address of the Cluster Manager VM. |
| **Step 5** | For VMware, deploy the CPS 21.1.0 Cluster Manager VM following the instructions provided in the CPS Installation Guide for VMware or CPS Installation Guide for OpenStack depending on your deployment.   | **Note** | Preserve the old Cluster Manager and create a new Cluster Manager with CPS 21.1.0 as new deployment. Deploy the CPS 21.1.0 Cluster Manager by referring to CPS Installation Guide for VMware or CPS Installation Guide for OpenStack depending on your deployment. | | --- | --- |   | **Important** | The VM is rebooted in rescue mode for the first time for CentOS to adjust disk/hardware to the new version. Subsequent reboots if necessary is a normal operation. | | --- | --- |    For Openstack, it is mandatory to delete the previously deployed Cluster Manager in order to deploy the new Cluster Manager. If the previously deployed Cluster Manager is not deleted, new Cluster Manager deployment fails. |
| **Step 6** | After the deployment has been completed, check its status using the Status API.  **For example:**  ``` URL : http://<<cluster-ip>>:8458/api/system/status/cluman Eg:http://172.18.11.151:8458/api/system/status/cluman Header: Content-Type:application/json Success Message: {  "status": "ready" }  ``` |
| **Step 7** | Copy the migrate tar.gz file from the external location to the new CPS 21.1.0 Cluster Manager, and run the `/mnt/iso/migrate.sh restore cluman <full_path>/migrate_<date_and_time>.tar.gz` command as shown in the following example.  ``` sftp> put migrate_cluman_20180720_200701.tar.gz on cluman. cd /mnt/iso ./migrate.sh restore cluman /root/migrate_20180720_200701.tar.gz ```  When the restore has completed, you should see messages like the following:  ``` 2018-07-21 01:42:21,497 INFO [restore_cluman.restore_fingerprints] Restore fingerprint files. 2018-07-21 01:42:21,531 INFO [restore_cluman.restore_logs] Restoring and copying migrated logs to archive directory. 2018-07-21 01:42:21,532 INFO [restore_cluman.restore_env_config] Restore cluman env_config files. 2018-07-21 01:42:22,441 INFO [restore_cluman.restore_config_br] Restore cluman config_br files. 2018-07-21 01:42:22,441 INFO [backup.handleRequest] Action Import 2018-07-21 01:42:22,443 INFO [backup.etc] Restore: etc 2018-07-21 01:42:22,544 INFO [__main__.<module>] ===================== 2018-07-21 01:42:22,544 INFO [__main__.<module>]  SUCCESS 2018-07-21 01:42:22,544 INFO [__main__.<module>] ======== END ========  ```  | **Important** | After restoring Cluster Manager, manually reapply any nonstandard customizations or modifications that were done previously; for example, system files/configuration files (which were backed up in [Step 3](#t_migratecluman_2110__step_A2245057C2A149CCAC78F5C6D071602F)). | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 8** | Run the `about.sh` and `diagnostics.sh` scripts to verify that Cluster Manager is able to communicate with other VMs. For example:  ``` about.sh Cisco Policy Suite - Copyright (c) 2015. All rights reserved.  CPS Multi-Node Environment  CPS Installer Version - 21.1.0 CPS Core Versions ---------------------------          lb01: qns-1           (iomanager): 19.4.0.release          lb01: qns-2   (diameter_endpoint): 19.4.0.release          lb01: qns-3   (diameter_endpoint): 19.4.0.release  ```  In the example, you can see that the CPS Installer Version was migrated to 21.1.0, but the VMs still have the old version, since they have not yet been migrated.  You can also verify the time zone and the CentOS version as shown in the following example:  ``` cat /etc/redhat-release  CentOS Linux release 8.1.1911 (Core) ```  | **Note** | As AIDO was not running in the older VM sets which were on previous release (for example, 19.4.0), you can observe some failures in diagnostics for AIDO service till all the VMs are migrated to 21.1.0. You can ignore these failures.  diagnostics output sample:  ``` Checking AIDO status on all VMs...[PASS]                      AIDO service is not installed on pcrfclient01, may be pre 19.4 build on pcrfclient01                      AIDO service is not installed on pcrfclient02, may be pre 19.4 build on pcrfclient02                      AIDO service is not installed on sessionmgr01, may be pre 19.4 build on sessionmgr01                      AIDO service is not installed on sessionmgr02, may be pre 19.4 build on sessionmgr02                      AIDO service is not installed on sessionmgr03, may be pre 19.4 build on sessionmgr03                      AIDO service is not installed on sessionmgr04, may be pre 19.4 build on sessionmgr04                      AIDO service is not installed on sessionmgr05, may be pre 19.4 build on sessionmgr05                      AIDO service is not installed on sessionmgr06, may be pre 19.4 build on sessionmgr06                      AIDO service is not installed on sessionmgr07, may be pre 19.4 build on sessionmgr07                      AIDO service is not installed on sessionmgr08, may be pre 19.4 build on sessionmgr08  ``` | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 9** | You can disable syncing of carbon database and bulk statistics files to decrease the ISSM time by adding the following parameters in /var/install.cfg file.   * SKIP\_BLKSTATS * SKIP\_CARBONDB   Example to disable:  ``` SKIP_BLKSTATS=1 SKIP_CARBONDB=1  ```  | **Note** | If you are disabling the carbon database and bulk statistics synchronization (i.e., by setting the SKIP\_BLKSTATS=1 and SKIP\_CARBONDB=1), then the old Grafana and bulk statistics data are not available on newly deployed CPS system (migrated CPS system). | | --- | --- |  | **Note** | If the whisper files are of large size, system takes more time to synchronize the carbon database files from pcrfclient01 to pcrfclient02 which can increase the ISSM time.  For example, if /var/lib/carbon/whisper is 55 GB, it takes around 15 - 20 hours to synchronize the carbon database files depending on the network speed. To decrease the ISSM time, you can disable the carbon database files and bulk statistics files synchronization as explained in earlier note.  Before starting the migration, it is recommended to run the `/var/qps/install/current/puppet/modules/qps/templates/etc/whisper/clear_wsp_files.sh` utility once on the PCRF nodes to clear any WSP files older than 90 days. | | --- | --- | |

## Migrate CPS Set 1 VMs

Once Cluster Manager has been migrated, the migration of the CPS VMs can be started. To do this, the CPS cluster must be divided
into two sets: Set 1 and Set 2 (similar to what is done during an ISSU). Set 1 is migrated first, as described in this section.
After the migration of Set 1, if there are no call drops, you can continue with the migration of Set 2 VMs. However, if there
is a failure after migrating Set 1, you must perform a migration rollback.

| **Note** | ---   Diagnostic fails during migration. This is normal since NTP may be converging, mongo replica sets are not synced, and so on. If you see HAProxy diagnostics warnings about Diameter endpoints being down, see [HAProxy Diagnostics Warnings](#id_47389) for a workaround.  You can disable syncing of carbon database and bulk statistics files to decrease the ISSM time. For more information, refer to [Disable Syncing Carbon Database and Bulk Stats Files](#concept_5BAF763683CB4610932E847CBB8812EE).   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   In CPS 21.1.0, CentOS has 8.1 version. Also, all the packages are compatible with CentOS 8.1.  The updated corosync version is not compatible with the previous version corosync. Due to this, there is some traffic loss expected. Traffic loss scenario is only applicable if you are using lbvips for Diameter peering. This is transient and the system recovers automatically once VMs are upgraded to the new Corosync version   --- |

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Run the create-cluster-sets command to create the cluster sets for migration:  `/var/qps/install/current/scripts/create-cluster-sets.sh`  You should see the following output:  ``` Created /var/tmp/cluster-upgrade-set-1.txt Created /var/tmp/cluster-upgrade-set-2.txt ```  | **Note** | Before executing `create-cluster-sets.sh` script make sure Hosts.csv file has the VM host names in order.  Here is a Hosts.csv sample file for reference:  ``` [root@localhost csv]# cat Hosts.csv Hypervisor Name,Guest Name,Role,Alias,Datastore,Networks -->,Internal,Management, esxi-host-3,lb01,lb01,lb01,datastore3,,192.168.105.13,10.197.98.61, esxi-host-4,lb02,lb02,lb02,datastore4,,192.168.105.14,10.197.98.62, esxi-host-3,sessionmgr01,sm,sessionmgr01,datastore3,,192.168.105.15,, esxi-host-4,sessionmgr02,sm,sessionmgr02,datastore4,,192.168.105.16,, esxi-host-3,qns01,qps,qns01,datastore3,,192.168.105.17,, esxi-host-4,qns02,qps,qns02,datastore4,,192.168.105.18,, esxi-host-3,qns03,qps,qns03,datastore3,,192.168.105.22,, esxi-host-4,qns04,qps,qns04,datastore4,,192.168.105.25,, esxi-host-3,pcrfclient01,pcrfclient01,pcrfclient01,datastore3,,192.168.105.19,, esxi-host-4,pcrfclient02,pcrfclient02,pcrfclient02,datastore4,,192.168.105.20,, ```  Once `create-cluster-sets.sh` is executed, cluster-upgrade-set-1.txt and cluster-upgrade-set-2.txt are created.  Here are the same output files:  ``` [root@localhost scripts]# cat /var/tmp/cluster-upgrade-set-1.txt pcrfclient02 lb02 sessionmgr02 qns02 qns04 [root@localhost scripts]# cat /var/tmp/cluster-upgrade-set-2.txt pcrfclient01 lb01 sessionmgr01 qns01 qns03 ``` | | --- | --- |  | **Note** | It is recommended to review the cluster-upgrade-set files to verify that the database members of a replica-set doesn't belong to the same cluster-upgrade-set-x. If Yes, either move any one of the database member to the other /var/tmp/cluster-upgrade-set-y.txt file or change the replica-set definition in mongocfg.cfg file. Refer to the CPS Installation Guide for VMware for defining a replica-set. | | --- | --- | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | (Optional) You can reduce the migration time by provisioning the VMs. If you do not want to provision the VMs, go to [Step 3](#t_migratecpsvmsset_2110__step_E20BDFA9605E4378A153892EFFA306F4).   | **Note** | The VM provisioning requires extra disk space for each VM. Provisioning can be done only for VMware environment setups. | | --- | --- |  1. Open a separate terminal and run the following command to provision Set 1 VMs:     ```    /var/qps/install/current/scripts/deployer/support/deploy_all.py –-provision --vms /var/tmp/cluster-upgrade-set-1.txt        ```     This command can be run in parallel to disabling Set 1.         | **Note** | Manually enter `deploy_all.py` command in your system. |    | --- | --- |        | **Note** | The `–-provision` and `–-useprovision` options must be updated to `--nossh`. To use `--nossh` for deploying VM, vCenter 6.5 must be deployed and all existing ESXi hosts must be mapped to the vCenter. For `--usecl`, you should use a customized user instead of vCenter administrator user for which you need to have basic privileges. For nossh feature, you must use `--nossh` and for usecl feature you must use `--nossh --usecl`. To use `--usecl`, content libraries must be pre-configured. The pre-configured content libraries are part of usecl only. For more information, see the CPS Installation Guide for VMware.  Add the vCenter hostname and admin credentials either at run time or in Configuration.csv file.  Here is a sample configuration:  ``` vcenter_hostname,host.cisco.com, vcenter_user,administrator@vsphere.local, vcenter_passwd,cisc0123 ```  If you are deploying the VMs using the `--nossh`:  * You have to map the ESXi to the vCenter. While mapping, the ESXi must have the same name as ESXi name given in the CPS configurations. * The vCenter used for the deployment should maintain the unique data store names in the ESXi. |    | --- | --- | 2. (Optional) For Single Cluster Setup, if you have corosync cluster between pcrfclient01 and pcrfclient02 and you want to keep    the newly deployed cluster of corosync up. To do so, shutdown the older corosync cluster which hosts arbitervips by executing    `monit stop corosync` on Set 2 pcrfclient (pcrfclient01).  When Set 2 gets deployed, pcrfclient01 joins the new cluster normally.         | **Note** | During pcrfclient02 deployment, there will be no active arbitervip. |    | --- | --- | 3. (Optional) For Two Cluster Setup or if you have arbitervip between Cluster-A pcrfclient01 and Cluster-B pcrfclient01: Before    deploying Set 2 VM's on Cluster-A, execute `monit stop corosync` on Cluster-B pcrfclient01.         | **Note** | Do not start corosync on Cluster-B pcrfclient01 manually. |    | --- | --- |         When Cluster-B Set 2 gets deployed, Cluster-B's pcrfclient01 will join the new cluster normally.         | **Note** | Perform the above step only if you have arbitervips across clusters (Cluster-A and Cluster-B). During Cluster-A's pcrfclient01 deployment, there will be no active arbitervip. |    | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | Run the following command to disable Set 1 VMs: `/mnt/iso/migrate.sh disable set 1` When Set 1 has been disabled, you should see messages like the following:  ``` 2018-07-21 01:53:49,894 INFO [__main__.extra_banner]         ======================================================================         | Backing up to file: /var/tmp/migrate_set-1_20180621_212456.tar.gz         ======================================================================  2018-07-21 02:00:12,252 INFO [backup.handleRequest] ====================================================== 2018-07-21 02:00:12,253 INFO [backup.handleRequest] Archive /var/tmp/migrate/set-1/config_other_br.tar.gz is created with requested backups. 2018-07-21 02:00:12,253 INFO [backup.handleRequest] ====================================================== 2018-07-21 02:00:12,253 INFO [__main__.run_recipe] Performing installation stage: Create backup Tar 2018-07-21 02:00:12,577 INFO [__main__.<module>] ===================== 2018-07-21 02:00:12,578 INFO [__main__.<module>]  SUCCESS 2018-07-21 02:00:12,578 INFO [__main__.<module>] ======== END ========  ``` |
| **Step 4** | Confirm that the Set 1 VMs' sessionmgrs are removed from the replica sets by running the following command:  `diagnostics.sh --get_rep` Example output is shown below:  ``` CPS Diagnostics HA Multi-Node Environment --------------------------- Checking replica sets... |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Mongo:3.6.9          MONGODB REPLICA-SETS STATUS INFORMATION        Date : 2019-08-21 02:00:27 | |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| |  SET NAME  -  PORT  : IP ADDRESS - REPLICA STATE - HOST NAME  -  HEALTH  - LAST SYNC - PRIORITY | |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | ADMIN:set06                                                                                     | |  Member-1  -  27721 : 172.16.2.100  -  ARBITER  -  arbitervip   - ON-LINE  -  --------   -   1  | |  Member-2  -  27721 : 172.16.2.22   -  PRIMARY  -  sessionmgr01 - ON-LINE  -  No Sync  	 -   3  | |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | AUDIT:set05                                                                                     | |  Member-1  -  27017 : 172.16.2.100  -  ARBITER  -  arbitervip   - ON-LINE  -   --------  -   1  | |  Member-2  -  27017 : 172.16.2.22   -  PRIMARY  -  sessionmgr01 - ON-LINE  -  No Sync    -   3  | |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | BALANCE:set02                                                                                   | |  Member-1  -  27718 : 172.16.2.100  -  ARBITER  -  arbitervip   - ON-LINE  -   --------  -   1  | |  Member-2  -  27718 : 172.16.2.22   -  PRIMARY  -  sessionmgr01 - ON-LINE  -  No Sync    -   3  | |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | REPORTING:set03                                                                                 | |  Member-1  -  27719 : 172.16.2.100  -  ARBITER  -  arbitervip   - ON-LINE  -   --------  -   1  | |  Member-2  -  27719 : 172.16.2.22   -  PRIMARY  -  sessionmgr01 - ON-LINE  -  No Sync    -   3  | |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | SESSION:set01                                                                                   | |  Member-1  -  27717 : 172.16.2.100  -  ARBITER  -  arbitervip   - ON-LINE  -   --------  -   1  | |  Member-2  -  27717 : 172.16.2.22   -  PRIMARY  -  sessionmgr01 - ON-LINE  -  No Sync    -   3  | |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | SPR:set04                                                                                       | |  Member-1  -  27720 : 172.16.2.100  -  ARBITER  -  arbitervip   - ON-LINE  -   --------  -   1  | |  Member-2  -  27720 : 172.16.2.22   -  PRIMARY  -  sessionmgr01 - ON-LINE  -  No Sync    -   3  | |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  ``` |
| **Step 5** | If you have provisioned VMs using [Step 2](#t_migratecpsvmsset_2110__step_1FAEB5759C4344C4B4C1C0D8ECA86EBF), you can restart VM using provisioned vmdk image by running the following command and then go to [Step 6](#t_migratecpsvmsset_2110__step_5851334F8C5E4AE8BD88B1F3FA388593).  ``` /var/qps/install/current/scripts/deployer/support/deploy_all.py –-useprovision --vms /var/tmp/cluster-upgrade-set-1.txt  ```  | **Note** | If you have not provisioned VMs, go to [Step 6](#t_migratecpsvmsset_2110__step_5851334F8C5E4AE8BD88B1F3FA388593). | | --- | --- |  | **Note** | Manually enter `deploy_all.py` command in your system. | | --- | --- | |

| **Step 7** | Once the VMs are Powered ON, if you are using static route, copy static route files (i.e. route-ifname) to the VMs where they are configured. After copying static route files, restart the network services and monit processes on these VMs. |
| **Step 8** | Run the following command to enable Set 1 VMs:  `/mnt/iso/migrate.sh enable set 1 /var/tmp/migrate-set-1_<timestamp>.tar.gz`  For example:  `/mnt/iso/migrate.sh enable set 1 /var/tmp/migrate_set-1_20180621_212456.tar.gz`   | **Note** | The migration does not restore users created with `adduser.sh` due to potential gid/uid conflicts. Check the migrate enable log for entries that indicate users that are not being migrated, and then manually recreate them using  `adduser.sh`. An example log is shown below:  ``` 2018-06-21 14:52:15,999 INFO [etc_passwd.parse_etc_passwd] Parsing  /var/tmp/migrate/pcrfclient02/etc/passwd file 2018-06-21 14:52:16,000 INFO [etc_group.parse_etc_group] Parsing  /var/tmp/migrate/pcrfclient02/etc/group file 2018-06-21 14:52:16,000 WARNING [restore_vm.restore_vms] On Host:pcrfclient02 User/Group  mongoreadonly/mongoreadonly is not being migrated and must be manually created using adduser.sh. 2018-06-21 14:52:16,000 WARNING [restore_vm.restore_vms] On Host:pcrfclient02 User/Group  admin/admin is not being migrated and must be manually created using adduser.sh.  ``` | | --- | --- |   After the script has run, you should see information like the following:  ``` WARNING  Mongo Server trying to reconnect while pushing config.

| **Step 9** | Execute the following on primary member of ADMIN replica-set using sharding database.   | **Note** | Perform the following steps on all the other admin database replica-sets. | | --- | --- |  1. Unsetting migrating shards.     ```    >db.cache_config.updateMany({},{"$unset":{"migratingShards":1}})    ``` 2. Change the configuration version.  `>db.config.update({"_id" : 1},{$inc : { version : 1}})` 3. Remove versions and insert it back.     ```    >db.versions.remove({})    >db.versions.insert({ "_id" : "cache_config", "version" : NumberInt(0), "previousVersion" : NumberInt(0), "migrationStatus" : "COMPLETE" });        ``` |
| **Step 10** | Check the status of the SkRings and run `rebuildAllSkRings` to create entries by executing the following commands from any OSGi console of any Policy Server (QNS) VM:   | **Note** | The following command is applicable only for memcache setup. You can ignore this step for SKDB set up. | | --- | --- |  ``` >skRingRebuildStatus >rebuildAllSkRings  ``` |
| **Step 11** | Verify that Set 1 VMs have been migrated by running `about.sh` command:  Example output is shown below:  ``` CPS Core Versions ---------------------------          lb01: qns-1           (iomanager): 19.4.0.release          lb01: qns-2   (diameter_endpoint): 19.4.0.release          lb01: qns-3   (diameter_endpoint): 19.4.0.release          lb01: qns-4   (diameter_endpoint): 19.4.0.release          lb02: qns-1           (iomanager): 21.1.0.release          lb02: qns-2   (diameter_endpoint): 21.1.0.release          lb02: qns-3   (diameter_endpoint): 21.1.0.release          lb02: qns-4   (diameter_endpoint): 21.1.0.release         qns01: qns-1                (pcrf): 19.4.0.release         qns02: qns-1                (pcrf): 21.1.0.release         qns03: qns-1                (pcrf): 19.4.0.release         qns04: qns-1                (pcrf): 21.1.0.release pcrfclient01: qns-1        (controlcenter): 19.4.0.release pcrfclient01: qns-2                   (pb): 19.4.0.release pcrfclient02: qns-1        (controlcenter): 21.1.0.release pcrfclient02: qns-2                   (pb): 21.1.0.release  ``` |
| **Step 12** | Migrate traffic swap by running the following command: Check for call traffic to determine if you can proceed with the migration of Set 2 VMs.  `/mnt/iso/migrate.sh traffic swap`  After the traffic swap has run, you should see information like the following:  ``` Creating MD5 Checksum...

### What to do next

If some of the replica-set members are in RECOVERING state, refer to [Recover Replica-set Members from RECOVERING State](#task_24AFDC487FD64CACB2AECDC5D6873D94).

## Migrate CPS Set 2 VMs

After you have successfully migrated the CPS Set 1 VMs, you can migrate the Set 2 VMs as described in this section.

| **Note** | ---   Diagnostic fails during migration. This is normal since NTP may be converging, mongo replica sets are not synced, and so on. If you see HAProxy diagnostics warnings about Diameter endpoints being down, see [HAProxy Diagnostics Warnings](#id_47389) for a workaround.  You can disable syncing of carbon database and bulk statistics files to decrease the ISSM time. For more information, refer to [Disable Syncing Carbon Database and Bulk Stats Files](#concept_5BAF763683CB4610932E847CBB8812EE).   --- |

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Run the following command to disable the Set 2 VMs:  `/mnt/iso/migrate.sh disable set 2`  After the script has run, you should see information like the following:  ``` 2018-07-21 01:53:49,894 INFO [__main__.extra_banner]         ======================================================================         | Backing up to file: /var/tmp/migrate_set-2_20180621_015349.tar.gz         ======================================================================  2018-07-21 02:00:12,252 INFO [backup.handleRequest] ====================================================== 2018-07-21 02:00:12,253 INFO [backup.handleRequest] Archive /var/tmp/migrate/set-2/config_other_br.tar.gz is created with requested backups. 2018-07-21 02:00:12,253 INFO [backup.handleRequest] ====================================================== 2018-07-21 02:00:12,253 INFO [__main__.run_recipe] Performing installation stage: Create backup Tar 2018-07-21 02:00:12,577 INFO [__main__.<module>] ===================== 2018-07-21 02:00:12,578 INFO [__main__.<module>]  SUCCESS 2018-07-21 02:00:12,578 INFO [__main__.<module>] ======== END ========  ```  | **Note** | Grafana view (GUI) does not display any information till pcrfclient01 is deleted. As soon as pcrfclient01 is deleted, Grafana GUI display comes up. After recreating pcrfclient01, Grafana view (GUI) does not show till Set 2 VMs (where pcrfclient01 is present) is enabled. Data is not lost, only Grafana view (GUI) is not displayed. | | --- | --- | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | (Optional) You can reduce the migration time by provisioning the VMs. If you do not want to provision the VMs, go to [Step 3](#t_migratecpsvmsset2_2110__step_D455F6CC159D491C9576AC72E33A7763).   | **Note** | The VM provisioning requires extra disk space for each VM. Provisioning can be done only for VMware environment setups. | | --- | --- |  1. After provisioning Set 1 VMs, you can provision Set 2 VMs by running the following command:     ```    /var/qps/install/current/scripts/deployer/support/deploy_all.py –-provision --vms /var/tmp/cluster-upgrade-set-2.txt        ```        | **Note** | Manually enter `deploy_all.py` command in your system. |    | --- | --- |        | **Note** | The `–-provision` and `–-useprovision` options must be updated to `--nossh`. To use `--nossh` feature for deploying VM, vCenter 6.5 must be deployed and all existing ESXi hosts must be mapped to the vCenter. For `—usecl` feature, you can use a customized user instead of vCenter administrator user for which you need to have basic privileges. For nossh feature, you must use `--nossh` and for usecl feature you must use `--nossh --usecl`. To use this feature, content libraries must be pre-configured. The pre-configured content libraries are part of usecl feature only. For more information, see the CPS Installation Guide for VMware.  Add the vCenter hostname and admin credentials either at run time or in Configuration.csv file.  Here is a sample configuration:  ``` vcenter_hostname,host.cisco.com, vcenter_user,administrator@vsphere.local, vcenter_passwd,cisc0123 ```  If you are deploying the VMs using the `--nossh` feature:  * You have to map the ESXi to the vCenter. While mapping, the ESXi must have the same name as ESXi name given in the CPS configurations. * The vCenter used for the deployment should maintain the unique data store names in the ESXi. |    | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | Confirm that the Set 2 VMs sessionmgrs are removed from the replica sets by running the following command:  `diagnostics.sh --get`  Example output is shown below:  ``` CPS Diagnostics HA Multi-Node Environment --------------------------- Checking replica sets... |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Mongo:3.6.9          MONGODB REPLICA-SETS STATUS INFORMATION        Date : 2018-08-21 03:13:58 | |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| |  SET NAME  -  PORT  : IP ADDRESS - REPLICA STATE - HOST NAME  -   HEALTH - LAST SYNC - PRIORITY | |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | ADMIN:set06                                                                                     | |  Member-1  -  27721 : 172.16.2.100  -  ARBITER  -  arbitervip   - ON-LINE -  --------    -    0 | |  Member-2  -  27721 : 172.16.2.23   -  PRIMARY  -  sessionmgr02 - ON-LINE -  No Sync     -    2 | |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | AUDIT:set05                                                                                     | |  Member-1  -  27017 : 172.16.2.100  -  ARBITER  -  arbitervip   - ON-LINE  -  --------    -   0 | |  Member-2  -  27017 : 172.16.2.23   -  PRIMARY  -  sessionmgr02 - ON-LINE  -  No Sync     -   2 | |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | BALANCE:set02                                                                                   | |  Member-1  -  27718 : 172.16.2.100  -  ARBITER  -  arbitervip    - ON-LINE  -  --------   -   0 | |  Member-2  -  27718 : 172.16.2.23   -  PRIMARY  -  sessionmgr02  - ON-LINE  -  No Sync    -   2 | |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | REPORTING:set03                                                                                 | |  Member-1  -  27719 : 172.16.2.100  -  ARBITER  -  arbitervip    - ON-LINE  -  --------   -   0 | |  Member-2  -  27719 : 172.16.2.23   -  PRIMARY  -  sessionmgr02  - ON-LINE  -  No Sync    -   2 | |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | SESSION:set01                                                                                   | |  Member-1  -  27717 : 172.16.2.100  -  ARBITER  -  arbitervip    - ON-LINE  -  --------   -   0 | |  Member-2  -  27717 : 172.16.2.23   -  PRIMARY  -  sessionmgr02  - ON-LINE  -  No Sync    -   2 | |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | SPR:set04                                                                                       | |  Member-1  -  27720 : 172.16.2.100  -  ARBITER  -  arbitervip    - ON-LINE  -   --------  -   0 | |  Member-2  -  27720 : 172.16.2.23   -  PRIMARY  -  sessionmgr02  - ON-LINE  -  No Sync    -   2 | |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|   ``` |
| **Step 4** | If you have provisioned VMs using [Step 2](#t_migratecpsvmsset2_2110__step_1FAEB5759C4344C4B4C1C0D8ECA86EBF), you can restart VM using provisioned vmdk image by running the following command and then go to [Step 5](#t_migratecpsvmsset2_2110__step_53922179258D4B33A0D5E00D8A5DC33C).  ``` /var/qps/install/current/scripts/deployer/support/deploy_all.py –-useprovision --vms /var/tmp/cluster-upgrade-set-2.txt ```  | **Note** | If you have not provisioned the VMs, go to [Step 5](#t_migratecpsvmsset2_2110__step_53922179258D4B33A0D5E00D8A5DC33C). | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 5** | Re-deploy the Set 2 VMs.   | **Note** | Delete Set 2 VMs before redeploying them with the new base.vmdk. | | --- | --- |  | **Note** | To install the VMs using shared or single storage, you must use `/var/qps/install/current/scripts/deployer/deploy.sh $host` command.

### What to do next

Execute the following command from Cluster Manager to cleanup the backup which was been created at the time of provisioning:

`/var/qps/install/current/scripts/deployer/support/deploy_all.py --cleanupbackup`

| **Note** | ---   As the change in the replica-sets is not complete at the time of restart, sometimes non-functional impacting errors are listed in the logs. Therefore, for each site, run `restartall.sh` from the Cluster Manager to do a rolling restart of all the nodes at the end of the migration process.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Caution** | ---   Executing `restartall.sh` will cause messages to be dropped.   --- |
| --- | --- |

If some of the replica-set members are in RECOVERING state, refer to [Recover Replica-set Members from RECOVERING State](#task_24AFDC487FD64CACB2AECDC5D6873D94).

## Change SSH Keys

| **Note** | ---   If you are using default SSH keys, you are required to change the SSH keys after migration. Make sure migration is completed successfully.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Before you begin

Before changing SSH keys, make sure diagnostics is clean and there is no alarm/warning.

| **Note** | ---   It's important to change SSH keys at least once.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | To generate new keys execute the following command on installer VM (Cluster Manager). `/var/qps/install/current/scripts/bin/support/manage_sshkey.sh --create` |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Update keys on CPS VMs and installer VM (Cluster Manager). `/var/qps/install/current/scripts/bin/support/manage_sshkey.sh --update` |

## Recover Replica-set Members from RECOVERING State

If the migration is
performed with live traffic on CPS, there is a possibility that after the
migration replica-set members (for huge size databases members like, BALANCE,
SPR, REPORTING and so on) can go into RECOVERING state. This is due to the
oplog (operation log) size configured which holds the database operation on
PRIMARY which might get rolled-over.

To recover the
replica-set members from RECOVERY state, you need to perform the steps
described in this section:

### Procedure

---

| Execute `rs.printReplicationInfo()` command on PRIMARY database for replica-set whose members went into RECOVERING state to get the configured oplog size and log length start to end information:  ```  mongo sessionmgr01:27718 set02:PRIMARY> rs.printReplicationInfo() configured oplog size:   5120MB log length start to end: 600secs (0.16hrs) oplog first event time:  Fri Feb 24 2017 19:51:25 GMT+0530 (IST) oplog last event time:   Mon Feb 27 2017 22:14:17 GMT+0530 (IST) now:                     Mon Feb 27 2017 22:14:25 GMT+0530 (IST) set02:PRIMARY>   ```  `rs.printSlaveReplicationInfo` shows the replication lag time (how much secondary is behind the primary member). If you see that this lag is increasing and not catching-up with primary, then this indicates that oplog is getting rolled-over.  ```  mongo sessionmgr01:27718 set02:PRIMARY> rs.printSlaveReplicationInfo() source: sessionmgr02:27718 syncedTo: Mon Feb 27 2017 22:13:17 GMT+0530 (IST)  10 secs (0 hrs) behind the primary   ``` |
| --- |

---

### What to do next

If the migrated
members are still stuck in RECOVERING state, then:

1. Stop the process
   manually.
2. Refer to
   Recovery
   using Remove/Add members Option section in
   CPS Troubleshooting Guide to remove failed
   member and add the member back.

## Geographic Redundant Deployment Migration

| **Note** | ---   In this release, CentOS has been upgraded to 8.1 version. Also, all the packages have been upgraded to be compatible with CentOS 8.1.  The updated corosync version is not compatible with the previous version corosync. Due to this, there is some traffic loss expected. Traffic loss scenario is only applicable if you are using lbvips for Diameter peering. This is transient and the system recovers automatically once VMs are upgraded to the new Corosync version   --- |
| --- | --- |

This section describes the process for performing a migration in a Geographic Redundant deployment. The following example
is a Geo replica case involving a replica set containing five members: two members on site 1, two members on site 2, and one
arbiter member on site 3 (migration from CPS 19.4.0/CPS 19.5.0 to CPS 21.1.0). Each step shows the MongoDB version and the
CentOS version on the VM; for example, 3.6.9/7.7.1908 to 3.6.17/8.1.1911.

Before starting ISSM, qns\_hb process should be disabled in Policy Director (LB) VMs for GR configuration. Once Policy Director
(LB) VMs is recreated as part of ISSM process, qns\_hb process should be disabled again in newly created Policy Director (LB)
VM.

| **Important** | ---   CPS 19.5.0 was a Limited Availability release with user restrictions.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   In the following table:   * SM = Session Manager * S1 = Site 1 * S2 = Site 2 * S3 = Third Site * 3.6.9 = MongoDB version 3.6.9 * 3.6.17 = MongoDB version 3.6.17 * 7.7 = CentOS 7.7.1908 * 8.1 = CentOS 8.1.1911 * R194 = CPS Release 19.4.0 * R211 = CPS Release 21.1.0  --- |

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Disable monitoring database script by commenting out configured sets from mon\_db configs on pcrfclient01/pcrfclient02/cluman in the following files:  ``` /etc/broadhop/mon_db_for_callmodel.conf /etc/broadhop/mon_db_for_lb_failover.conf /var/qps/install/current/scripts/build/build_etc.sh  ``` |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Using HA migrate process, Migrate site 1 VMs to CPS 21.1.0.   1. For Single Cluster Setup, if you have corosync cluster between pcrfclient01 and pcrfclient02 and you want to keep the newly    deployed cluster of corosync up. To do so, shutdown the older corosync cluster which hosts arbitervips by executing `monit stop corosync` on Set 2 pcrfclient (pcrfclient01).  When Set 2 gets deployed, pcrfclient01 joins the new cluster normally.         | **Note** | During pcrfclient02 deployment, there will be no active arbitervip. |    | --- | --- | 2. For Two Cluster Setup or if you have arbitervip between Cluster-A pcrfclient01 and Cluster-B pcrfclient01: Before deploying    Set 2 VM's on Cluster-A, execute `monit stop corosync` on Cluster-B pcrfclient01.         | **Note** | Do not start corosync on Cluster-B pcrfclient01 manually. |    | --- | --- |         When Cluster-B Set 2 gets deployed, Cluster-B's pcrfclient01 will join the new cluster normally.         | **Note** | Perform the above step only if you have arbitervips across clusters (Cluster-A and Cluster-B). During Cluster-A's pcrfclient01 deployment, there will be no active arbitervip. |    | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | Using HA migrate process, Migrate site 2 VMs to CPS 21.1.0 |
| **Step 4** | Using third-site arbiter migrate process, Migrate site 3 (3rd Site arbiter) to CPS 21.1.0. |
| **Step 5** | Verify all replica set members are running CPS 21.1.0. |
| **Step 6** | Enable monitoring by uncommenting configured sets from mon\_db configs on pcrfclient01/pcrfclient02/cluman in the following files:  ``` /etc/broadhop/mon_db_for_callmodel.conf /etc/broadhop/mon_db_for_lb_failover.conf /var/qps/install/current/scripts/build/build_etc.sh ``` |

It is required to modify SSH keys once GR installation/migration is complete.

#### Before you begin

Make sure diagnostics is clean and there is no alarm/warning.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | On Site 1's Cluster Manager execute the following steps:   1. Generate new keys. `/var/qps/install/current/scripts/bin/support/manage_sshkey.sh --create` 2. Update keys on CPS VMs and Installer VM (Cluster Manager). `/var/qps/install/current/scripts/bin/support/manage_sshkey.sh --update` 3. Backup new SSH keys. `cd /var/qps/auth; tar -cvf current_ssh_keys.tar current/` |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Transfer /var/qps/auth/current\_ssh\_keys.tar to Site 2 Cluster Manager.  In case 3rd site Arbiter is also deployed, transfer the file to 3rd site arbiter. |
| **Step 3** | On Site 2 execute the following steps.   1. Restore SSH keys. `mkdir -p /var/qps/auth/temp/{qns,root};` 2. Copy tar file to `/var/qps/auth/ ; tar -xvf current_ssh_keys.tar`. `cp /var/qps/auth/current/root/* /var/qps/auth/temp/root/ ; cp /var/qps/auth/current/qns/* /var/qps/auth/temp/qns/ ;` 3. Update keys on CPS VMs and Installer VM (Cluster Manager). `/var/qps/install/current/scripts/bin/support/manage_sshkey.sh --update` |

## Migrate 3rd Site Arbiter

Migrate Site 1 and Site 2, and then migrate 3rd Site Arbiter.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Copy the new CPS 21.1.0 ISO to the existing CPS arbiter. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Unmount the old CPS ISO by running the following command:  `unmount /mnt/iso` |
| **Step 3** | Mount the new CPS 21.1.0 ISO to the arbiter by running the following command:  `mount -o loop cps-arbiter-x.x.x.iso /mnt/iso` |
| **Step 4** | Disable the arbiter by running the following command:  `/mnt/iso/migrate.sh disable arbiter`  This command creates the following file:  `/var/tmp/migrate_arbiter_<date_&_time>.tar.gz`  After the command has run successfully, you should see messages like the following:  ``` 2018-07-10 07:51:42,633 INFO [command.execute] Mongo port:27719 stopped successfully 2018-07-10 07:51:42,633 INFO [__main__.run_recipe] Performing installation stage: ExtractInstallArtifacts 2018-07-10 07:51:42,634 INFO [extract_install_artifacts.extract_scripts] Extracting CPS scripts 2018-07-10 07:51:43,506 INFO [__main__.run_recipe] Performing installation stage: PrepareWorkingDir 2018-07-10 07:51:43,506 INFO [__main__.run_recipe] Performing installation stage: BackupArbiter 2018-07-10 07:52:25,715 INFO [__main__.run_recipe] Performing installation stage: Create backup Tar 2018-07-10 07:52:37,921 INFO [__main__.<module>] ===================== 2018-07-10 07:52:37,921 INFO [__main__.<module>]  SUCCESS 2018-07-10 07:52:37,921 INFO [__main__.<module>] ======== END ========  ``` |

| **Step 6** | Deploy the new arbiter using the CPS 21.1.0 ISO and the new\_base\_vm as the new deployment. To do this, use the instructions provided in the CPS Geographic Redundancy Guide for your operating system. |
| **Step 7** | Copy the migrate tar.gz file from the external location to the new CPS 21.1.0 arbiter, and run the following command:  `/mnt/iso/migrate.sh enable arbiter <full_path>/migrate_arbiter_<date_and_time>.tar.gz`  After the migration has run successfully, you should see messages like the following:  ``` 2018-07-13 15:45:53,187 INFO [command.execute] child process started successfully, parent exiting 2018-07-13 15:45:53,188 INFO [command.execute] ^[[60G[^[[0;32m  OK  ^[[0;39m] 2018-07-13 15:45:53,189 INFO [command.execute] 2018-07-13 15:45:53,189 INFO [__main__.<module>] ===================== 2018-07-13 15:45:53,189 INFO [__main__.<module>]  SUCCESS 2018-07-13 15:45:53,189 INFO [__main__.<module>] ======== END ========  ``` |
| **Step 8** | Run `about.sh` and verify the time zone and CentOS version on the arbiter. You should see output like the following:  ``` about.sh Cisco Policy Suite - Copyright (c) 2015. All rights reserved.  CPS Arbiter  CPS Installer Version - 21.1.0  ```   The timezone on the arbiter must be changed to UTC as shown below:  ``` cat /etc/*elease CentOS Linux release 8.1.1911 (Core) CentOS Linux release 8.1.1911 (Core) CentOS Linux release 8.1.1911 (Core) [root@site3-arbiter log]# date Tue June 21 02:42:54 UTC 2020  ``` |

* [Change SSH Keys - 3rd Site Arbiter](#task_dlt_blk_r4b)

### Change SSH Keys - 3rd Site Arbiter

It is required to modify SSH keys once 3rd Site Arbiter installation/migration is complete.

#### Before you begin

Make sure diagnostics is clean and there is no alarm/warning.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Restore SSH keys on 3rd site arbiter. `mkdir -p /var/qps/auth/temp/{root,qns};` |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Copy SSH keys backup from Site1 to arbiter on /var/qps/auth path. |
| **Step 3** | Untar the files. `cd /var/qps/auth; tar -xvf current_ssh_keys.tar` |
| **Step 4** | Update the keys.  ``` /usr/bin/cp /var/qps/auth/current/root/* /var/qps/install/current/puppet/modules/qps/files/root/ /usr/bin/cp /var/qps/auth/current/qns/* /var/qps/install/current/puppet/modules/qps/files/home/qns/ /var/qps/install/current/scripts/build/build_puppet.sh /var/qps/install/current/scripts/upgrade/reinit.sh ``` |

## Disable Syncing Carbon Database and Bulk Stats Files

To disable syncing of carbon database
and bulk statistics files, add the following parameters in /var/install.cfg
file:

* SKIP\_BLKSTATS
* SKIP\_CARBONDB

Example to disable:

```
SKIP_BLKSTATS=1
SKIP_CARBONDB=1

```

## HAProxy Diagnostics Warnings

Traffic
swapping/restoring is accomplished on a silo basis by turning Diameter
endpoints up or down. During migration, there is a chance that endpoints might
not recover. If this happens, HAProxy diagnostics warnings indicate that
Diameter endpoints are down. This section provides a workaround for enabling
the endpoints manually if these errors occur.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Display any HAProxy diagnostics warnings by running the following command:  `diagnostics.sh --ha_proxy`  Example warnings that Diameter endpoints are down are shown below:  ``` Checking HAProxy statistics and ports... [WARN]   HA Proxy Diameter is displaying some services as down or with errors.  If services are restarting, this is normal.   Please wait up to a minute after restart is successful to ensure services are marked up.    Services marked DOWN 1/2 are coming up (1 success in last 2 tries).  Services marked UP 1/3 are going down.    Go to the following url for complete HA Proxy status information: http://lbvip01:5540/haproxy-diam?stats  ----------------------------------- diameter-int1-vip-lb02-A DOWN L4CON  Sessions (current,max,limit): 0,1, Rate (sessions,max,limit): 0,1, Last Status change (seconds): 63027 diameter-int1-vip-lb02-B DOWN L4CON  Sessions (current,max,limit): 0,1, Rate (sessions,max,limit): 0,1, Last Status change (seconds): 63025 diameter-int1-vip-lb02-C DOWN L4CON  Sessions (current,max,limit): 0,1, Rate (sessions,max,limit): 0,1, Last Status change (seconds): 63024 -----------------------------------   ```  In each load balancer, there are four java processes running (iomgr, diameter\_endpoint\_1, diameter\_endpoint\_2, diameter\_endpoint\_3). Each one of the diameter endpoints have a different OSGI port (9092, 9093, 9094). |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | To disable endpoints, you need to run commands like those shown in the example series below.  Make sure you choose the proper load balancer node. If this is being done to enable the diameter endpoint for Set-1, then use lb02. If it is being done for Set-2, then use lb01. The example is for set-2, and thus uses lb01.   1. Log in to the OSGi console    and run the excludeEndpoints command as shown in the following example:    ```    telnet localhost 9092    Trying 127.0.0.1...    Connected to localhost.    Escape character is '^]'.         osgi> excludeEndpoints    osgi>            ``` 2. Enable the    endpoints by running the following command:  `clearExcludedEndpoints` 3. Leave the    OSGi console (without killing the process) by running the disconnect command as    shown below:     ```    osgi> disconnect    Disconnect from console? (y/n; default=y) y    Connection closed by foreign host.        ``` |
| **Step 3** | After you run clearExcludedEndpoints, it will take a minute and then HAProxy will pick it up. If it does not, then restart the processes as follows:  ``` monit restart qns-1 monit restart qns-2 monit restart qns-3 monit restart qns-4  ``` |

---

## Troubleshooting

If an error is reported during the migration, the migration process is paused. In order to allow you to resolve the underlying
issue, refer to the following sections:

### Session Cache Database in UNKNOWN State

**Issue:** Session cache database is in UNKNOWN state. Session cache status can be displayed using `diagnostics.sh --get_replica_status`.

**Symptoms:** While migrating/upgrading, if there is a power outage or blade issue it impacts both the sets/clusters/sites resulting in
inconsistent MongoDB versions between the sets/clusters/sites. For example, one set/cluster/site is upgraded to the latest
MongoDB version, for example, 3.6.9 and another set/cluster/site is still on lower MongoDB version, for example, 3.4.16. In
this case, auto-recovery for session cache/SK database does not work resulting in UNKNOWN state of the members.

**Solution:** You can either upgrade to the latest CPS version supporting latest MongoDB version or rollback to previous CPS version supporting
older MongoDB version.

## Migration Rollback

The following steps describe the process to restore a CPS cluster to the previous version when it is determined that an In
Service Software Migration is not progressing correctly or needs to be abandoned after evaluation of the new version.

Migration rollback using the following steps can only be performed after Migration Set 1 is completed. These migration rollback
steps cannot be used if the entire CPS cluster has been migrated.

* [Rollback Considerations](#id_27053)
* [Roll Back the Migration](#task_tql_y5y_wy)

### Rollback Considerations

* The automated rollback process can only restore the original software version.
* You must have a valid Cluster Manager VM backup (snapshot/clone) which you took prior to starting the migration.
* The migration rollback should be performed during a maintenance window. During the rollback process, call viability is considered
  on a best effort basis.
* Rollback is only supported for deployments where Mongo database configurations are stored in `mongoConfig.cfg` file. Alternate methods used to configure Mongo will not be backed up or restored.
* Rollback is not supported with a `mongoConfig.cfg` file that has sharding configured.
* For replica sets, a rollback does not guarantee that the primary member of the replica set will remain the same after a rollback
  is complete. For example, if sessionmgr02 starts off as the primary, then a migration will demote sessionmgr02 to secondary
  while it performs an upgrade. If the upgrade fails, sessionmgr02 may remain in secondary state. During the rollback, no attempt
  is made to reconfigure the primary, so sessionmgr02 will remain secondary. In this case, you must manually reconfigure the
  primary after the rollback, if desired.

### Roll Back the Migration

The following steps describe how to roll back the migration for Set 1 VMs.

#### Before you begin

* Check for call traffic.
* Make sure that you have the run `/mnt/iso/migrate.sh enable set 1` command. The rollback will work only after that command has been run.
* Run `diagnostics.sh --get_replica_status` to check which new Set 1 sessionmgrXX (even numbered) MongoDB processes are in RECOVERING state. If so, manually stop all those processes on respective session
  managers.

  Example:

  ```

  |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Mongo:3.6.17          MONGODB REPLICA-SETS STATUS INFORMATION Date : 2019-07-23 10:44:20|
  |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |  SET NAME - PORT  : IP ADDRESS - REPLICA STATE - HOSTNAME -HEALTH - LASTSYNC - PRIORITY|
  |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | ADMIN:set06                                                                            |
  | Member-1 -  27721 : 172.20.35.25 - PRIMARY   - sessionmgr01 - ON-LINE - No Primary - 3 |
  | Member-2 -  27721 : 172.20.35.34 - ARBITER   - arbitervip   - ON-LINE - --------   - 1 |
  | Member-3 -  27721 : 172.20.35.26 - SECONDARY - sessionmgr02 - ON-LINE -   12 min   - 1 |
  |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | BALANCE:set02                                                                          |
  | Member-1 -  27718 : 172.20.35.34 - ARBITER   - arbitervip   - ON-LINE -  --------  - 1 |
  | Member-2 -  27718 : 172.20.35.25 - PRIMARY   - sessionmgr01 - ON-LINE -  --------  - 3 |
  | Member-3 -  27718 : 172.20.35.26 - RECOVERING- sessionmgr02 - ON-LINE -  12 min    - 1 |
  |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

  ```

  As you can see in the example, sessionmgr02 from `Balance: set02` is in RECOVERING state, you need to manually stop process for 27718.

  `/usr/bin/systemctl stop sessionmgr-27718`

  | **Important** | ---   Make sure the process has been stopped properly by running the command: `ps -ef|grep 27718`. If it has not stopped, then manually kill the process.   --- |
  | --- | --- |

  | **Note** | ---   If a member is shown in an unknown state, it is likely that the member is not accessible from one of other members, mostly an arbiter. In that case, you must go to that member and check its connectivity with other members.  Also, you can login to MongoDB on that member and check its actual status.   --- |
  | --- | --- |

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | For Single Cluster Setup, if you have corosync cluster between pcrfclient01 and pcrfclient02 and you want to keep the newly deployed cluster of corosync up. To do so, shutdown the older corosync cluster which hosts arbitervips by executing `monit stop corosync` on Set 2 pcrfclient (pcrfclient01).  When Set 2 gets deployed, pcrfclient01 joins the new cluster normally.   | **Note** | During pcrfclient02 deployment, there will be no active arbitervip. | | --- | --- | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | (Optional) For Two Cluster Setup or if you have arbitervip between Cluster-A pcrfclient01 and Cluster-B pcrfclient01: Before deploying Set 2 VM's on Cluster-A, execute `monit stop corosync` on Cluster-B pcrfclient01.   | **Note** | Do not start corosync on Cluster-B pcrfclient01 manually. | | --- | --- |   When Cluster-B Set 2 gets deployed, Cluster-B's pcrfclient01 will join the new cluster normally.   | **Note** | Perform the above step only if you have arbitervips across clusters (Cluster-A and Cluster-B). During Cluster-A's pcrfclient01 deployment, there will be no active arbitervip. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | Start the rollback of Set 1 VMs by running the following command:  `/mnt/iso/migrate.sh rollback`  After the script has run, you should see information like the following:  ``` 2019-07-23 20:10:30,653 INFO [fabric_tasks.run] Stopping all services on remote VM qns04 2019-07-23 20:10:30,654 INFO [transport._log] Secsh channel 3 opened. 2019-07-23 20:10:40,745 INFO [transport._log] Secsh channel 4 opened. 2019-07-23 20:10:42,111 INFO [__main__.<module>] ===================== 2019-07-23 20:10:42,111 INFO [__main__.<module>]  SUCCESS 2019-07-23 20:10:42,111 INFO [__main__.<module>] ======== END ========  ``` |
| **Step 4** | Save the Set 1 backup tar file (`migrate_set-1*.tar.gz`) to an external location.   | **Note** | This file was created by the `migrate disable set 1` command that was run when Set 1 VMs were disabled. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 5** | Restore the older Cluster Manager VM (for example, CPS 19.4.0) from the backup (snapshot/clone). |
| **Step 6** | Create cluster sets for migration rollback by running the following command:  ``` /var/qps/install/current/scripts/create-cluster-sets.sh ```  You should see the following output:  ``` Created /var/tmp/cluster-upgrade-set-1.txt Created /var/tmp/cluster-upgrade-set-2.txt ``` |
| **Step 7** | Delete and redeploy Set 1 VMs on the original CPS/basevm.  For VMware, run the following command to redeploy the Set 1 VMs:  `/var/qps/install/current/scripts/deployer/deploy.sh $host`  where, $host is the short alias name and not the full host name.  **For example:**  `./deploy.sh qns02`   | **Note** | If you are using OpenStack, assign arbitervip, lbvip01, lbvip02 and gx vip to pcrfclient02 internal ip, lb02 management ip, lb02 internal ip, and lb02 gx ip respectively. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 8** | Copy the migrate\_set-1\_\* file from the external location to the Cluster Manager VM. |
| **Step 9** | Mount the CPS\_\*.release.iso to the existing CPS Cluster Manager by running the following command. If the migration was attempted from x.iso to y.iso, and for the rollback, mount y.iso.  `mount -o loop CPS_*.release.iso /mnt/iso`  where, \* is the release number to which you have migrated.  For example, `mount -o loop CPS_20.2.0.release.iso /mnt/iso` |
| **Step 10** | Run the following command to enable Set 1 VMs. For example:  `/mnt/iso/migrate.sh enable set 1 /root/migrate-set-1-<timestamp>.tar.gz file`  For example:  `/mnt/iso/migrate.sh enable set 1 /root/migrate_set-1_20170120_212456.tar.gz`  After the script has run, you should see information like the following:  ``` WARNING  Mongo Server trying to reconnect while pushing config. Attempt #1 INFO     Priority set operation is completed for SPR-SET1 INFO     Priority set to the Database members is finished INFO     Validating if Priority is set correctly for Replica-Set: SPR-SET1 INFO     Validated Priority is set correctly for Replica-Set: SPR-SET1 2019-07-23 02:45:48,950 INFO [__main__.<module>] ===================== 2019-07-23 02:45:48,950 INFO [__main__.<module>]  SUCCESS 2019-07-23 02:45:48,951 INFO [__main__.<module>] ======== END ========  ```  | **Note** | Corosync may disable the admin arbiter (mongod) on the active arbitervip. If so, re-run  `/mnt/iso/migrate.sh enable set 1`. | | --- | --- | |

---

#### What to do next

If after rollback is completed and few members are still stuck in RECOVERY state, then:

1. Stop the process manually.
2. Refer to the Recovery using Remove/Add members Option section in the CPS Troubleshooting Guide to remove failed member and add the member back.

## Remove ISO Image

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | (Optional) After the migration is complete, unmount the ISO image from the Cluster Manager VM. This prevents any “device is busy” errors when a subsequent upgrade is performed.  `cd /root`  `umount /mnt/iso` |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | (Optional) After unmounting the ISO, delete the ISO image that you loaded on the Cluster Manager to free the system space.  `rm -rf /<path>/CPS_x.x.x.release.iso` |

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

| **Additional Public Relations** | media\_pr@cisco.com |

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.1 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 9.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 9.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 9.8 |

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |

| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.

|  | **Press Contacts** |
| --- | --- |
| **Michael Ricketts** | Email: micricke@cisco.comPhone: +1 919 392 2756 |
| **Additional Public Relations** | media\_pr@cisco.com |

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

This vulnerability is due to a weakness in the SSH subsystem of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to an affected device through SSH. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to an affected system as the *root* user.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cps-static-key-JmS92hNv>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco Policy Suite.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases Customers are advised to take appropriate actions as indicated in the following table:       | Cisco Policy Suite Software Release | Vulnerability status | Remediation action |   | --- | --- | --- |   | Earlier than 20.2.0 | Vulnerable | Upgrade to 21.1.0. |   | 20.2.0 | Vulnerable | Contact TAC to get a patch installed. |   | 21.1.0 | Vulnerable | Change the default SSH keys. |   | 21.2.0 and later | Not vulnerable | See footnote 1 |      1. Releases 21.2.0 and later will automatically create new SSH keys during installation but not during an upgrade. If a device is upgraded from 21.1.0, the keys should still be changed by using the following procedure.   Change the Default SSH Keys To generate new SSH keys and propagate them to all the machines in the deployment, follow these steps:  **Step 1**  To generate new keys, execute the following command on installer VM (Cluster Manager):  ```   /var/qps/install/current/scripts/bin/support/manage_sshkey.sh --create   ```  **Step 2**  Update keys on CPS VMs and installer VM (Cluster Manager):  ```   /var/qps/install/current/scripts/bin/support/manage_sshkey.sh --update   ```  This procedure is documented in [CPS Migration and Upgrade Guide, Release 21.1.0](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/quantum-policy-suite/R21-1-0/CPS21-1-0MigrationandUpgradeGuide/CPS18-0-0MigrationandUpgradeGuide_1_chapter_01.html#task_m3s_mhk_r4b).

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.
