- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The software does not properly track and release allocated memory while parsing crafted binary messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory leak due to insufficient tracking and release of allocated memory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Memory exhaustion, potentially leading to denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending crafted binary messages to the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the capability to send crafted messages to the device over the network. No specific position is mentioned, implying remote exploitation is possible.
