Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-40116:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided content directly references CVE-2021-40116 within a Cisco Security Advisory, confirming its relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability is caused by the improper handling of "Block with Reset" or "Interactive Block with Reset" actions in Snort rules, specifically when these rules are configured without proper constraints.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - The core weakness is the lack of sufficient constraints in Snort rules using the mentioned "Block with Reset" actions. This lack of constraints allows an attacker to exploit this vulnerability.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the affected device. This DoS can cause through traffic to be dropped.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector is remote and involves sending a crafted IP packet to the vulnerable device.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote, they need the ability to send crafted IP packets to the targeted device.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:**
    *   All open-source Snort3 project releases prior to version 3.1.0.100
    *   Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) software if configured with Snort3 and vulnerable rules.
        *   Specifically, FTD devices managed by FMC are vulnerable if:
            *   Running Snort3.
            *   A rule with a "Block with Reset" or "Interactive Block with Reset" action is configured
            *   The rule with a "Reset" action doesn't specify an application or protocol (TCP or UDP).
        *   FTD devices managed by FDM are not vulnerable as they lack these actions.
*   **Non-Vulnerable Products:**
    *   Open source Snort2 releases.
    *   Cisco ASA Software.
    *   Cisco 1000 and 4000 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs).
    *   Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge, 8200, 8300, and 8500 Series Edge Platforms.
    *   Cisco Cloud Services Router 1000V Series.
    *   Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) software.
    *   Cisco Integrated Services Virtual Router (ISRv).
    *   Cisco Meraki Security Appliances.
*   **Workarounds:**
    *   Revert the Snort inspection engine from Snort3 to Snort2.
    *   Change rule actions from "Block with Reset" or "Interactive Block with Reset" to another action.
    *   Narrow the firewall reset rule to specifically block TCP and/or UDP or an application that runs over those protocols.
*   **Fixed Software:**
    *   Cisco has released free software updates which include the fix
    *   Cisco FTD software fixed in version 7.0.1 or later. (6.4.0.13, 6.6.5.1, and 6.7.0.3 also include fixes.)
    *   Open source Snort fixed in version 3.1.0.100 or later.
*   **CVSS Score:** Base score of 8.6
*   **CWE:** CWE-241
