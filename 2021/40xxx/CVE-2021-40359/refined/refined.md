- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected systems do not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname when downloading files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path Traversal (CWE-22) vulnerability due to improper handling of pathnames.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause the pathname to resolve to a location outside the restricted directory, allowing them to read unexpected critical files.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low privileges, but no user interaction is required.
