- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected systems store sensitive information in log files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive information exposure due to improper handling of log files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with access to the log files could publicly expose the information or reuse it to develop further attacks on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the log files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local access to the system and its log files is required, which can be achieved through compromised accounts.
