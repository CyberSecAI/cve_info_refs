- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Authenticated path traversal vulnerability
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- **Attack vectors**: Authenticated attacker can exploit a path traversal vulnerability
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated.
