| Vulnerability file: `/coreframe/app/promote/admin/index.php:42-60`  ``` public function search() {     $siteid = get_cookie('siteid');     $page = isset($GLOBALS['page']) ? intval($GLOBALS['page']) : 1;     $page = max($page,1);     $fieldtype = $GLOBALS['fieldtype'];     $keywords = $GLOBALS['keywords'];     if($fieldtype=='place') {         $where = "`siteid`='$siteid' AND `name` LIKE '%$keywords%'";         echo $where;         $result = $this->db->get_list('promote_place', $where, '*', 0, 50,$page,'pid ASC');         $pages = $this->db->pages;         $total = $this->db->number;         include $this->template('listingplace');     } else {         $where = "`siteid`='$siteid' AND `$fieldtype` LIKE '%$keywords%'";         $result = $this->db->get_list('promote',$where, '*', 0, 20,$page,'id DESC');         $pages = $this->db->pages;         $total = $this->db->number;         include $this->template('listing');     } } ```  The `$fieldtype` parameter is controllable and the direct filtering of the `$keywords` parameter is not rigorous.
