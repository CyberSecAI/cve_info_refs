#### Paper 2021/923

### On the (in)security of ElGamal in OpenPGP

Luca De Feo, Bertram Poettering, and Alessandro Sorniotti

##### Abstract

Roughly four decades ago, Taher ElGamal put forward what is today one of the most widely known and best understood public key encryption schemes. ElGamal encryption has been used in many different contexts, chiefly among them by the OpenPGP standard. Despite its simplicity, or perhaps because of it, in reality there is a large degree of ambiguity on several key aspects of the cipher. Each library in the OpenPGP ecosystem seems to have implemented a slightly different "flavour" of ElGamal encryption. While --taken in isolation-- each implementation may be secure, we reveal that in the interoperable world of OpenPGP, unforeseen cross-configuration attacks become possible. Concretely, we propose different such attacks and show their practical efficacy by recovering plaintexts and even secret keys.

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 35 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [RPM-4.17](/wiki/Changes/RPM-4.17 "Changes/RPM-4.17")
* [IBus 1.5.25](/wiki/Changes/IBus_1.5.25 "Changes/IBus 1.5.25")
* [F35MingwEnvToolchainUpdate](/wiki/Changes/F35MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/F35MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")
* [golang1.17](/wiki/Changes/golang1.17 "Changes/golang1.17")
* [LLVM-13](/wiki/Changes/LLVM-13 "Changes/LLVM-13")

## Before the rebuild

```
- exclude GHC from the mass rebuild by updating the scripts before run.
- use rpmdevtools 9.5 for rpmautospec support

```

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, July 21st. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f35
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However, maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f35. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f35 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f35
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2020-07-21 10:00:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.

### @randombit **[randombit](/randombit)** commented [Aug 3, 2021](#issue-959570714)

Needs backport for 2.x

Hi. I'm one of the discoverers of the vulnerability (described [here](https://ibm.github.io/system-security-research-updates/2021/07/20/insecurity-elgamal-pt1) and [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/923)).

It seems there is a misunderstanding on the nature of the vulnerability (or maybe it's just an improper use of the word "smooth"): the affected public keys strictly follow El Gamal's original description, and do nothing "foolish". In particular, p-1 is not smooth: it contains a large prime factor, but also a large smooth factor, just like in DSA keys. The blame cannot fall solely on the library that does public key generation: it's a complex issue involving the whole OpenPGP ecosystem.

This patch properly fixes the vulnerability, but the comment is misleading. You may want to edit it, so that in, say, 10 years time some maintainer doesn't feel it's ok to ignore "foolish" implementations. Note that there is nothing you can do against really foolish implementations that use truly smooth p-1: for these, message recovery is always possible no matter what the encrypting party does.

Thanks, I did in fact just skim and clearly misunderstand the paper. I thought the issue was these keys had chosen `p` completely at random rather than via a structured way and due to poor luck had generated a `p` where `p - 1` truly had only small factors. I will edit the comment.

This is not very important, I'm just being a 🤓: if you took a `p` of 2048 bits at random, the chances that all the prime factors of `p-1` are smaller than, say, 200 bits are ≈10^-11. You would need some **criminally** poor luck for that to happen!

Relatedly, we would definitely appreciate if the comment and/or commit message contained a link to our paper 😊

# On the (in)security of ElGamal in OpenPGP - Part II [#](#on-the-insecurity-of-elgamal-in-openpgp---part-ii)

This post continues the description of our work that analyses the security
of the ElGamal public key encryption scheme in the OpenPGP context. In the
[previous post](/2021/07/20/insecurity-elgamal-pt1) we discussed attacks
targeting weak combinations of parameter
choices and we saw how ciphertexts generated under those settings could be
recovered easily.

This post describes instead attacks enabled by side-channels. While
side-channel attacks are not new, we show here how the combination of insecure
ElGamal configurations in some cases lowers the cost of the attack to the
point of feasibility on commodity hardware. In particular, we present

* an hitherto unknown side-channel attack against [Libgcrypt](https://dev.gnupg.org/source/libgcrypt/)’s modular exponentiation routine;
* how the side-channel information lowers the complexity of key-recovery attacks;
* how key-recovery attacks become feasible on commodity hardware in the interoperable world of OpenPGP, where a key generated by Crypto++ is used by Libgcrypt to decrypt. In particular, we show an end-to-end attack where a co-located adversary is able to fully recover the secret key of a victim that uses a 2048-bit ElGamal key. Note that 2048 bit is currently considered a secure key length.

In our [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/923) we also present
side-channel attacks against the modular exponentiation
routines of [crypto++](https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp) and
[Go](https://github.com/golang/crypto/tree/master/openpgp/elgamal) which we
do not review in this blog post.

## Background [#](#background)

### Cache-based side-channel attacks [#](#cache-based-side-channel-attacks)

The security of cryptographic protocols and schemes is often endangered in
non-ideal settings where implementations leak additional information to
the adversary. This is due to implementations unwillingly revealing information
through side-effects that are observable in either the physical world (e.g. power
consumption, noise, temperature) or the digital world (e.g. cache usage,
execution time). Here we focus on the latter, and in particular, on attacks
that target the CPU cache. We summarise here the salient points about this
class of attacks and refer the reader to
[this](https://cr.yp.to/antiforgery/cachetiming-20050414.pdf),
[this](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/papers/cache-joc-20090619.pdf) or
[this](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/448.pdf) article for further details.

Modern CPUs use a hierarchical memory architecture: fast, ephemeral memory with
low capacity is backed by slower, permanent storage with higher capacity. Data
is retrieved from storage and usually cached at all levels of the memory
hierarchy until it’s available as input to the CPU gates (usually in registers)
for the desired operations. CPU caches usually sit right before registers in
said hierarchy, and are usually *inclusive*: when data is cached at a given
cache level, it is also cached in lower levels. Also, given that the size of
any level of cache is smaller than lower levels, including a datum in a cache
usually involves evicting some other. Finally, data access times are vastly
different based on whether and at which level a given datum is cached. These
properties may be used to construct a side-channel, where observing the time it
takes to access a specific datum reveals information about its (or other
data’s) current caching status. This in turn reveals whether executing a
specific piece of code required access to a specific datum. Crucially, if this
datum relates to a cryptographic secret, this information may be revealed to an
attacker.

As an example, consider the pseudocode below, containing the famous
left-to-right square-and-multiply approach to modular exponentiation of base
`b` to the power `e` modulo `m`.

```

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  ``` | ``` function exponentiation(b, e, m) x ← 1 for i ← |e| − 1 downto 0 do 	x ← x^2 	x ← x mod m 	if (e[i] = 1) then 		x ← x * b 		x ← x mod m 	endif done return x  ``` |
| --- | --- |

```

If an attacker knew – for each round of the `for` loop – whether the
condition of the `if` at line 5 is true, they would discover all the bits of
the secret exponent. This information is conveyed through a cache side channel:
for example, the code that implements multiplication (used at line 6) will be
cached each time the condition is true, since that code needs to be executed.

A local attacker could extract this information using
[FLUSH+RELOAD](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/448.pdf): roughly speaking, the
attacker would evict from the cache some portion of a target function (in our
example, the function for the multiplication) at the beginning of each
iteration of the loop, and would attempt to access it at the end. If the access
time is below a certain threshold, it means that it was conceivably brought
in the cache by an execution of the target of the conditional jump at line 5.
This fact then leaks the bit at position `i`. Repeating the experiment
for each round of the loop leaks the value of the exponent.

### Modular exponentiation in Libgcrypt [#](#modular-exponentiation-in-libgcrypt)

We target the function `_gcry_mpi_powm` of Libgcrypt at the version prior
to commit `632d80ef3` ([code](https://github.com/gpg/libgcrypt/blob/ccfa9f2c/mpi/mpi-pow.c#L393-L772)).

```

| ``` 1 2 3  ``` | ``` void _gcry_mpi_powm (gcry_mpi_t res,                 gcry_mpi_t base, gcry_mpi_t expo, gcry_mpi_t mod)   ``` |
| --- | --- |

```

The function implements modular exponentiation of `base` raised to `expo`
modulo `mod`. The result is stored in `res`.

Note that the `_gcry_mpi_powm` exponentiation routine is a little more involved
than the simple square-and-multiply method sketched above: At a high level,
instead of scanning the exponent bit by bit, it covers it with windows of
bit-width at most `W` such that these windows, without overlapping, cover all
the one-bits of the exponent. This technique is known as (left-to-right)
sliding window exponentiation. After precomputing a small number of values, it
can process one window at a time at the cost of a single multiplication (plus
the squarings), thus offering a speed-up. For further information, see
[Handbook of Applied Cryptography, Algo 14.85](https://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/about/chap14.pdf).

In what follows we describe the salient parts of the implementation. As a first
step, the `_gcry_mpi_powm` function determines window width `W` as follows
([code](https://github.com/gpg/libgcrypt/blob/ccfa9f2c/mpi/mpi-pow.c#L442-L451)):

```

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  ``` | ``` if (esize * BITS_PER_MPI_LIMB > 512)   W = 5; else if (esize * BITS_PER_MPI_LIMB > 256)   W = 4; else if (esize * BITS_PER_MPI_LIMB > 128)   W = 3; else if (esize * BITS_PER_MPI_LIMB > 64)   W = 2; else   W = 1;  ``` |
| --- | --- |

```

Once the window size is determined, the function
([code](https://github.com/gpg/libgcrypt/blob/ccfa9f2c/mpi/mpi-pow.c#L561-L580))
goes on to precompute a table `precomp` as follows

```

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5  ``` | ``` for (i = 1; i < (1 << (W - 1)); i++) { 	/* precomp[i] = base^(2 * i + 1) */ 	... }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

```

Note that for all odd indices `t` between `1` and `2^W-1` the table
compactly stores the value `base^t`. The main loop of the function
([code](https://github.com/gpg/libgcrypt/blob/ccfa9f2c/mpi/mpi-pow.c#L587-L700))
splits, left to right, the sequence of exponent bits into width-`W` windows
that are linked by stretches of zeroes. More precisely, before each iteration
of the loop
([code](https://github.com/gpg/libgcrypt/blob/ccfa9f2c/mpi/mpi-pow.c#L609-L665))
the bit-sequence `e0` covered by a window, its length `c0`, and the length `j`
of a window plus the length of the preceding stretch of zeroes is identified.
The code then enters the `for` loop
([code](https://github.com/gpg/libgcrypt/blob/ccfa9f2c/mpi/mpi-pow.c#L667-L695)),
whose main operations are summarised below.

```

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23  ``` | ``` ... rp = res->d; ... w.d = base_u; ... for (j += W - c0; j >= 0; j--) {     ...     for (k = 0; k < (1 << (W - 1)); k++)     {         ...         u.d = precomp[k];         mpi_set_cond (&w, &u, k == e0);         ...     }     ...     u.d = rp;     mpi_set_cond (&w, &u, j != 0);     mul_mod (xp, &xsize, rp, rsize, base_u, base_u_size,                 mp, msize, &karactx);     ... } j = c0;  ``` |
| --- | --- |

```

A picture is worth more than a thousand lines of code: the image below
represents an exponent written in binary, and its decomposition into
windows e₀, e₁, …, assuming `W = 5`. Ignore the color, for the
moment.

![Windowed exponentation](/system-security-research-updates/assets/posts_assets/sidechan/leakage.png)

In a nutshell, each iteration of the loop computes `j` times `x ← x^2`
and then `x ← x * precomp[e0]`. Note that, if this were implemented
naively, executing the operations would give away, through cache
side-channels, the nature of the operation (multiplication or squaring) and
the index `e0` used in the table look-up. The programmers of `libgcrypt`
took precautions by implementing the table look-up in a more sophisticated
way. First of all, the value of `e0` is not leaked because i) each
entry of the `precomp` table is accessed and ii) the `mpi_set_cond` is a secure
version of a conditional `memset()` operation that hides whether the condition
was true and hence whether the memory setting took place. Also, `mul_mod` is
used for both the multiplication and the squaring since in the last iteration
of the outer `for` loop, `mpi_set_cond` sets the second argument to coincide
with the first.

Despite these precautions, considerable leakage can still be obtained
by an attacker who can observe control flow dependent cache
perturbations: in particular, the values `j` and `c0` can be recovered
by counting the number of iterations of the outer `for` loop in the
figure above, since that loop is executed once per window. The bits
in red in the picture above represent the leaked information: the
position of each window is leaked by `c0`, and we know that each
window must end with a 1 bit; additionally, when `j > c0` we also
learn a stretch of consecutive 0 bits.

## Side channel based private key recovery in Libgcrypt [#](#side-channel-based-private-key-recovery-in-libgcrypt)

We consider a victim process that uses a private key to decrypt ElGamal
ciphertexts. The process uses an unpatched version of Libgcrypt that
suffers from the issues described in the previous section. Given that we
target cache side channels, the attacker may either be local, or it may be
running on a different, co-located, VM. The former may target any cache
level, the latter may only target LLC. Without loss of generality we
conduct the exploitation against the L1 cache, and we use FLUSH+RELOAD on
the shared (physical) data pages that host the Libgcrypt shared object.

Here we discuss how the adversary is able to determine the number of iterations
of the square/multiply loop (for each window) and how this information may be
employed towards recovering the secret exponent.

### Obtaining the leakage [#](#obtaining-the-leakage)

The attacker may obtain the leakage by monitoring the state of the instruction
cache line that contains code that is executed in the initialisation of the
`for` loop. In practice, this can be achieved with the FLUSH+RELOAD side
channel applied on a line of the instruction cache that is executed once per
window before the start of the loop. The probe reveals when such a cache line
is executed, and the time between two probes would depend on the execution time
of the loop. Crucially, the latter depends on `j` and `c0` for each iteration,
which would thus be leaked. This strategy is applicable in the case of the
`_gcry_mpi_powm` function: the implementation inlines the logic to determine
the the values of `j` and `c0` (and `e0`) before each iteration of the loop,
and so that code fills more than one cache line; the invocation of the
multiplication in the inner loop makes one iteration sufficiently long and
constant-time so that inter-probe timings measurably encode the number of
iterations of the inner loop.

We prototype an end-to-end attack in the SMT-colocated threat model. The
prototype uses two SMT-colocated processes, attacker and victim. The victim
process may be triggered by the attacker to perform ElGamal decryption. The
attacker process uses L1i FLUSH+RELOAD on the virtual address of the
memory-mapped `libgcrypt.so` shared object that contains the instruction cache
line to be monitored. To collect side channel data, the attacker partitions
time into `N` slots using the `rdtsc` instruction: at the beginning of each
slot, the target line is loaded into the cache, and the duration of the load
operation is measured; after that, the cache line is flushed and finally the
remaining (if any) time of the slot is spent in a busy loop. The attacker thus
collects `N` timing samples for load instructions from the target cache line.
We establish a threshold for the target system to determine whether the load is
likely to have been served from cache (cache *hit*). We then collect 10,000
measurements by repeatedly triggering the victim. We keep track of each slot
across all runs with a set of per-slot counters, all initialised to zero. For
each run, whenever the sample of a slot indicates a hit based on the threshold,
we increment the value of the corresponding counter.

![PRIME+PROBE results](/system-security-research-updates/assets/posts_assets/sidechan/libgcrypt-FR.png)

Figure 1.a plots the value of the counter of each slot for all runs. While
patterns are discernible, the leakage cannot be obtained yet without further
data processing. We employ a clustering strategy based on execution time, under
the hypothesis that figure 1.a contains samples that are generated at different
clock frequencies. Influencing factors are likely to include p-states,
c-states, frequency scaling and the power state of certain execution units.
Figure 1.b confirms the hypothesis: it plots a histogram of the running times
for the whole operation. The distribution of running times has a long tail, but most
of the mass is concentrated in the three visible peaks. We use this information
to cluster samples and show the results of the clustering in figure 1.c and
figure 1.d, showing probes whose running time falls in the interval covered by
the highest, and second highest peak, respectively. The peak intervals in the
two latter figures accurately encode the leakage for the key used in the
exponentiation. The two figures are identical modulo a scaling factor which
depends on the difference in running time.

It is interesting to notice that the first few peaks are well synchronised,
presumably because the difference in execution time are still within the range
of a probing time slot and so they cannot be distinguished by the probes. This
presents a very useful tool for the attacker to relax the synchronisation
assumptions by constantly monitoring for activity on the target address and
start measuring at the first sign of activity.

### Exploiting the leakage [#](#exploiting-the-leakage)

After having obtained the leakage, there is still some work left to do
to recover the secret exponent. Recall that the leakage gives us (as
highlighted in red in the figure above):

* The position of each window, and thus the position of its rightmost
  bit, which is always set to 1;
* The position of stretches of consecutive 0s, if any, between
  windows.

We are thus left with the task of finding the unkwnow bits within the
windows themselves. As a warm up, note that when `W = 1` there is
nothing left to do, as each window consists of exactly one bit, and
this is always set to 1. It is clear that the larger the window size
`W`, the more work we expect to do.

We do nothing really special to recover the unknown bits, we’re just a
tad smarter than exhaustive search. The Baby-step/giant-step
algorithm (see
[part I](../../07/20/insecurity-elgamal-pt1#computing-discrete-logarithms) of this
post) can indeed be adapted to search through a space of *n* unknown
bits for a cost of *2n/2* group operations, regardless of
how the unknown bits are distributed.[1](#fn:1)

The real work is to understand how many unknown bits are left, on
average, after the leakage. Mathematics help us here, as it turns out
there is an elegant, yet accurate, modeling of the leakage. The
details are beyond the scope of this post, but we invite the reader to
look into [the research paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/923) for
more. Here we’ll just note that the leakage approaches a normal
distribution, of parameters depending on the window size and on the
length of the exponent. The figure below shows the distribution, over
2¹⁴ random exponents, of the number of unknown bits, as the window
size `W` and the exponent length *n* vary.

![](/system-security-research-updates/assets/posts_assets/sidechan/entropy_over_n.png)
![](/system-security-research-updates/assets/posts_assets/sidechan/entropy_over_w.png)

What these graphs show is that some secrets are more at risk than
others. First, in each of the graphs above it is apparent that the
distribution has a relatively large variance, and thus some secrets
will be considerably weaker than the average secret.

Second, and most importantly, **cross-implementation scenarios make
the vulnerability worse**.

In our research we focus on the following scenario:

* A 2048-bit ElGamal key pair is generated by Crypto++;
* The key pair is imported in the GPG key ring, then GPG (i.e.,
  Libgcrypt) is used to decrypt messages.

While some may object that this scenario is unlikely, this is exactly
the purpose of having an interoperable standard such as OpenPGP.
Why is this scenario better for an attacker? Compare the bit length of
secret keys, for, e.g., a prime modulus of 2048 bits:

* Libgcrypt samples secret keys from *[1 … 2³⁴⁰]*, thus, according
  to the snippet of code above, uses windows of size `W = 4` when
  exponentiating by such a secret key;
* Crypto++ samples secret keys from *[1 … 2²²⁶]*, thus `W = 3` when
  the secret key is imported by Libgcrypt.

The difference is remarkable: in the first case, the average number of
unknown bits is *180.6*, in the second case only *98.0*. While in
both cases this is below the target security for a 2048 bits modulus,
finding the unknown bits in the Libgcrypt case still seems to be
infeasible. For Crypto++, on the other hand, an attack requiring
*2⁴⁸* group operations seems within reach of a nation state adversary.
Worse still, combining the cross-implementation scenario with the
effects of the large variance, we estimate that **one in 10,000
Crypto++ keys can be recovered for a cost of a few hundred thousand
dollars**. More modestly, we verified the attack on a much rarer
secret key: the weakest among *2²⁸* keys we generated with Crypto++.
After obtaining the leakage, our parallel baby-step/giant-step
implementation was able to recover the full secret in 30 minutes on 20
cores.

## FAQ [#](#faq)

### What kind of vulnerability did you find? [#](#what-kind-of-vulnerability-did-you-find)

We discovered a side-channel attack against Libgcrypt, which is the library
used by the popular GPG suite.

### What is the attack scenario? [#](#what-is-the-attack-scenario)

A co-located adversary (that is, a malicious user on a shared server, or a
malicious VM user on a multi-tenant hosting solution) may be able to
recover the secret key used by a victim in the course of decryption of a
ciphertext encrypted against an ElGamal key.

### Is the attack practical? [#](#is-the-attack-practical)

The complexity of the attack entirely depends on the (random) choice of
key. Certain keys are weaker than others (and so they can be broken in half
an hour, as we have shown), others can only be broken by state actors with
large computing power available, while still others are outright
unbreakable (because of this specific vulnerability).

### Am I affected? [#](#am-i-affected)

If you are a GPG (Libgcrypt) user and perform decryption using an ElGamal
key, you may be at risk. Update to the latest version of the software. (An
additional requirement for the attack is that the adversary be able to run
code on your machine).

## Endnotes [#](#endnotes)

1. Adapting to any pattern of unknown bits is a great feature of
   Baby-step/giant-step and a few other algorithms, that is
   unfortunately not shared by other well known discrete logarithm
   algorithms, such as Pollard’s Rho. [↩](#fnref:1)

# On the (in)security of ElGamal in OpenPGP - Part I

# On the (in)security of ElGamal in OpenPGP – Part I [#](#on-the-insecurity-of-elgamal-in-openpgp--part-i)

In this two-parts post we dissect the paper [“On the (in)security of
ElGamal in OpenPGP”](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/923), to be
presented at [ACM CCS’21](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2021/index.html).

**TL;DR:** we found two types of vulnerabilities in the way OpenPGP
implementations handle ElGamal encryption. We call the first type
*cross-configuration attacks*, where two otherwise secure PGP
implementations interact in an insecure way, leading to plaintext
recovery given a single ciphertext. Luckily, the majority of PGP
users seems to be unaffected, nevertheless we found more than 2000
vulnerable public keys. The second type of vulnerability, to be
described in [Part II](/2021/09/06/insecurity-elgamal-pt2) of this
post, is a classical
*side-channel vulnerability* leading to secret key recovery, however
we argue there that the cross-configuration scenario makes it worse.

This write-up is intended for a technical audience who wants to understand
the attacks without the clout of academic papers. If you’re simply
interested in understanding whether you might be affected, jump straight to
the [FAQ](#faq).

## 50 shades of ElGamal [#](#50-shades-of-elgamal)

In 1985, Taher ElGamal described the [first public key encryption
scheme based on discrete
logarithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal_encryption). The
scheme represented an alternative to the patented RSA cryptosystem and
has since become a staple of any course on cryptography. For such a
venerable, well known and, after all, simple scheme, you’d expect
little room for interpretation or doubt. And yet, do you think you
could fully specify all the details without making mistakes?

Ask two cryptographers to implement ElGamal, and chances are they will
make radically different choices in the way parameters are set up. In
the best case, the two implementations will simply be incompatible.
In the worst case, they may be compatible, but… Let’s pretend we
are one of those cryptographers tasked with implementing ElGamal, and
let’s go over the various choices in front of us.

### Prime modulus generation [#](#prime-modulus-generation)

We are talking about classic ElGamal, not variants based on elliptic
curves. The first thing we need is a finite field with a hard
discrete logarithm problem. Given the [current state of discrete log
cryptanalysis](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/697), this means a 2048
bit prime at the very least. We have two choices, already:

* **Some standardized prime**, such as those defined in [RFC
  2526](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3526);
* **Generate a prime** such that *p – 1* contains a *large enough* prime
  factor.

The first option is probably okay, but some users may be worried about
[backdoored primes](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/961). Another
argument against standard primes is that [it facilitates bulk
interception](https://weakdh.org/). Although it would be possible in
principle to define trustworthy standard primes, as a matter of fact
they do not appear to be very popular for ElGamal.

The second option leads to more choices. The goal is to generate a
prime *p* such that *p – 1* contains one large prime factor, call it
*q*. Here is a list of the most sensible choices:

* Generate a **safe prime**, i.e., such that *q = (p – 1)/2* is prime;
* Generate a **DSA-like prime**, i.e., first choose *q*, then try
  *p = qf + 1* for random *f* until a prime is found.
* Generate a **Lim–Lee prime**[1](#fn:1), i.e., one such that **all** prime
  factors of *(p – 1)/2* are large.

How large is “large” depends on the target security. [NIST’s FIPS-186
specification of
DSA](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-4.pdf)
requires *q* to be 224 or 256 bits long, for a prime *p* of 2048 bits.
Of course, in safe primes *q* is as large as it can be. Why, exactly,
*q* needs to be large is something we will come back to soon.

### Defining a group generator [#](#defining-a-group-generator)

The multiplicative group of integers modulo *p* contains several
subgroups: one for each divisor of *p – 1*. Of these, the most
important one is the subgroup of order *q*. To instantiate ElGamal we
need to specify a group generator, call it *g*, but again we have
at least two choices:

* A **generator of the full group** of invertible integers modulo *p*,
  which has order *p – 1*;
* A **generator of the prime order subgroup** of order *q*.

For efficiency, it may be interesting to find a small *g*. In the
first case this is always possible: start from *g = 2*, and increase
until a generator of the full group is found, which should happen
pretty fast. In the second case this is only possible for safe
primes: *g = 4* always works for safe primes, while for the two other kinds
of prime the subgroup of order *q* is unlikely to contain any small
elements other than *1*.

### Creating a key pair [#](#creating-a-key-pair)

The last step in key generation is to choose a secret exponent *x* and
form the public key *X = gx mod p*. For mathematical
soundness, *x* should be a uniformly random integer between *1* and
the order of *g* (so, either *p – 1* or *q*), thus ensuring that the
public key is a uniformly random element of the group generated by
*g*.

In some cases it is possible to forego some mathematical rigor and
draw *x* from a smaller interval. We shall call **“short exponents”**
secrets drawn this way. This speeds up key generation and decryption,
however we shall see that it is a risky choice. In no case shall *x*
be drawn from too small an interval, lest key recovery become feasible
via exhaustive search or [Pollard’s Lambda
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollard%27s_kangaroo_algorithm).

### Encryption [#](#encryption)

To encrypt to a public key *X* a message *M*, assumed to be an integer
modulo *p*, draw a random “ephemeral” exponent *y*, compute
*Y = gy mod p*, and form the ciphertext
*(Y, M·Xy mod p)*.

The exponent *y* can be sampled from the same intervals as the secret
key *x*. Use of **short exponents** in this case is even riskier,
as we shall see.

### Decryption [#](#decryption)

Decryption is the only routine where every choice is pre-determined.
Upon receiving a ciphertext *(Y, Z)*, the original message is
recovered as *M = Z/Yx mod p*.

Note how each decryption involves an exponentiation by the secret
exponent *x*. This will be important later when we discuss
side-channel attacks.

## ElGamal in PGP [#](#elgamal-in-pgp)

OpenPGP is a very popular standard aimed to promote consumable,
interoperable email security. The standard is defined in [RFC
4880](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4880), which dictates
message formats, operations and certain cryptographic aspects of the
standard. According to section 9.1 of the RFC, ElGamal is the only public
key encryption algorithm required for an implementation of the OpenPGP
standard, RSA being only recommended:[2](#fn:2)

> Implementations MUST implement DSA for signatures, and Elgamal for
> encryption. Implementations SHOULD implement RSA keys.

So, what flavour of ElGamal do you think the OpenPGP standard
mandates? The RFC is quite vague in that respect, only specifying the
public key format, and pointing to external references for algorithmic
details. Unsurprisingly, implementations have freely interpreted the
standard, leading to several interoperable but diverging realizations.

To get a picture of what variants of ElGamal are implemented in the
OpenPGP ecosystem, we studied three of the most popular RFC 4880
compliant implementations: [GPG](https://gnupg.org/),
[Crypto++](https://cryptopp.com/), and the [Go standard
library](https://golang.org/). Given that many lesser-known and
closed-source libraries also contribute to the ecosystem, we further
analyzed a dump of OpenPGP public keys obtained from an official key
server.

### OpenPGP key format [#](#openpgp-key-format)

The only common denominator among all libraries is the key format,
which is thoroughly specified in RFC 4880 (Key ID `0x10`). In
particular, an OpenPGP ElGamal subkey is a triple made of:

* the prime modulus *p*,
* the (sub)group generator *g*,
* the public key *gx*.

An ElGamal secret key consists of the subkey data above together with
the secret exponent *x*.

Without surprise, we found all libraries follow the standard in this
respect.

### GPG’s Libgcrypt [#](#gpgs-libgcrypt)

[Libgcrypt](https://dev.gnupg.org/source/libgcrypt/) is the C library
doing the crypto heavy-lifting for GPG. The roots of its ElGamal
implementation go as far back as 1997. The relevant ways in
which Libgcrypt interprets the standard are as follows:

* It generates **Lim–Lee primes**, with the size *q* of the
  **smallest** odd factor of *p – 1* chosen as a function of the size of
  *p*. In particular, when *p* is 2048 bits long, *q* is 225 bits
  long.
* It takes *g* to be the smallest integer *≥ 2* that **generates the
  full group** of invertible integers modulo *p*.
* It uses **short exponents** both for the secret key *x* and the
  ephemeral exponent *y*. The size of *x* and *y* is [roughly *3/2*
  that of
  *q*](https://github.com/gpg/libgcrypt/blob/1a83d/cipher/elgamal.c#L312-L315),
  with *y* usually ending up being a few bits longer than *x*. For
  *p* of 2048 bits, *x* has 340 bits and *y* has 344.

The algorithm to generate Lim–Lee primes was published in 1997, at a
time when people started being wary of attacks based on small
subgroups (more on them later), and when safe primes were still
considered to be too expensive to generate. It is thus not so
surprising that Libgcrypt uses this relatively little-known prime
modulus generation. The choice of using both small generators and
short exponents appears to have been dictated mainly by efficiency
considerations.

### Crypto++ [#](#crypto)

Crypto++ has implemented ElGamal since version 1.0. Source code
history only goes as far back as version 5.0, released in 2002, and by
that time the ElGamal implementation had already crystallized. These
are the choices made by Crypto++ by default:

* The modulus *p* is a random **safe prime** *p = 2q + 1*.
* The generator *g* is the **smallest quadratic residue**, i.e., the
  smallest generator of the subgroup of order *q*, i.e., one of *2*,
  *3* or *4*.
* It uses **short exponents** both for *x* and *y*. Both are sampled
  uniformly at random between *1* and *2n*, with [*n*
  depending on the size of
  *p*](https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/blob/434e3/nbtheory.cpp#L1045-L1050).
  When *p* is 2048 bits long, *n = 226*.

### Go standard library [#](#go-standard-library)

Go only implements ElGamal encryption and decryption, but no key
generation, it is thus not fully RFC 4880 compliant, for better or for
worse. The only choice it has to make is the size of the ephemeral
exponent *y*, and it makes a pretty boring (*i.e.*, safe) one: ***y*
is sampled uniformly between *0* and *p – 1***.

### OpenPGP public keys in the wild [#](#openpgp-public-keys-in-the-wild)

Open source libraries only make a fraction of the OpenPGP ecosystem.
To get a richer picture, we obtained a public key dump from
<https://pgp.key-server.io/dump/>, dated Jan 15, 2021, containing
2,721,869 keys, out of which 835,144 had ElGamal subkeys.

It is impossible to know everything about how a library implements
ElGamal by only looking at the public keys it produces. For example,
it is (hopefully) impossible to know what intervals *x* and *y* are
sampled from. However, just by looking at *p* and *g*, some
information can still be gained.

Safe primes are easy to recognize, as it is sufficient to test whether
*(p – 1)/2* is prime. For other primes, even a partial factorization of
*p – 1* can give a deal of information. Note that it is in general
difficult to completely factor integers of 2048 bits. We classified
primes into four categories:

* **Safe primes**.
* Non-safe primes for which we could not find any factor other than
  *2*. These are likely to be **Lim–Lee primes**.
* Non-safe primes for which we could complete the factorization of
  *p – 1*. These have unusually large *q* (within 99% the size of *p*),
  and for this reason we call them **quasi-safe primes**.
* Non-safe primes for which we could find some non-trivial factors,
  but we couldn’t complete the factorization. These are likely to
  have been generated ***à la* DSA**.

An interesting finding is that the vast majority of public keys only
used **one of 16 “standard” primes**. None of these primes appears to
have been defined in an RFC, and, while we could [track some of them
down](https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/blob/master/lib/dhparams.c),
we’re still unable to explain all of them.

A few more bribes of information can be gleaned from *g*. First, we
ran a [quadratic residuosity
test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_residue). For safe
primes this tells everything: if *g* is a square it generates the
subgroup of order *q*, if not it generates the full group. For other
primes, where we could find non-trivial factors, we ran [higher
residuosity
tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_residuosity_problem),
giving at least a hint to what group *g* generates. For all
categories of primes, we found the full spectrum of possibilities:

* *g* generates the full group (or at least nothing contradicts this
  hypothesis),
* *g* generates the subgroup of order *q* (or at least nothing
  contradicts this hypothesis),
* none of the above.[3](#fn:3)

### Summary [#](#summary)

That was pretty wild! Let’s try to systematize our findings via a
sort of ElGamal bingo card. In the table below we classify both
libraries and keys found in the wild according to how they select
parameters *p*, *g*, *x* and *y*. For some entries, we do not have
enough information to pin down the exact features, but we give our
best guess based on the data we have.

|  | Prime category | | | | Generated group size | | | Short exponents? | | Quantity | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Table 1:** Features of ElGamal
implementation found in libraries and public keys in the
wild. The last two columns give the number of non-expired keys
in total and since 2016. **Legend:** × = has feature,
? = likely has feature, – = not applicable; SP = Safe prime, LL = Lim–Lee
prime, DSA = DSA-like prime, QS = Quasi-safe prime.

As messy as this may look, we haven’t uncovered any specific issues so
far. All the configuration in the table are sound, interoperable, and
safe… if taken in isolation! Notice however the two lines in bold
red in the table: DSA-like I and III. We shall now see why these two
“perfectly fine” types of keys are to be considered vulnerable in the
OpenPGP ecosystem.

## Computing discrete logarithms [#](#computing-discrete-logarithms)

The attacks we are going to describe require minimal understanding of
discrete logarithm computations. In their simplest form, they are a
combination of the [Pohlig–Hellman
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pohlig%E2%80%93Hellman_algorithm)
for discrete logarithms in groups of composite order, and of Shanks’
[Baby-step giant-step
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby-step_giant-step).[4](#fn:4)

As usual, we are given *g* and *h = gz*, and our goal is to
find *z*. If *z* is drawn from a set *Z* of size *N*, Baby-step
giant-step finds it in roughly *N½* operations. Its
strength is in requiring roughly the same amount of work no matter how
complicated the set *Z* is. For example, we will use it in the [next
part](../../09/06/insecurity-elgamal-pt2) of this blog post to **find
*z* when some of its bits are known** via a side-channel.

Pohlig–Hellman will be useful in a slightly more involved scenario,
based on two key assumptions:

1. The order of the group generated by *g* contains some **small
   factors**,
2. *z* is a **short exponent**.

To fix ideas, let’s say that *p* is a 2048 bits prime, that *(p – 1) =
2qf₀f₁f₂···* with *fi* “small”, that *g* generates the full
group of invertible integers modulo *p*, and that *z* is *224* bits
long. The bitlength of *z* is supposedly set large enough that none
of the known discrete log algorithms could find *z* in a feasible
amount of time. In particular, Baby-step giant-step, with its
square-root complexity, would roughly take *2¹¹²* operations.

Without going into details, the Pohlig–Hellman algorithm reduces the
problem of computing discrete logs in the group of order *p – 1* to that
of computing discrete logs in each of the groups of order *2*, *q*,
*f₀*, *f₁*, etc. Another way to look at it is that, by solving a
discrete logarithm in the subgroup of order *fi*,
Pohlig–Hellman finds *log₂(fi)* bits of *z*.[5](#fn:5) If *z* were
2048 bits long, this wouldn’t help us at all: after learning

*1 + log₂(f₀) + log₂(f₁) + ···*

bits we would still be left with *log₂(q)* unknown bits, which,
assuming *p* was constructed correctly, would still be too much.

But we assumed that *z* is 224 bits long. Then, by solving a discrete
log in each of the “small” subgroups, we are left with only

*u = 224 – 1 – log₂(f₀) – log₂(f₁) – ···*

unknown bits. If this number is small enough, we can finish off the
computation with Baby-step giant-step, which takes roughly
*2u/2* operations.

## Cross-configuration attacks on OpenPGP [#](#cross-configuration-attacks-on-openpgp)

The algorithms above highlight some dangerous combinations of ElGamal
options. Specifically, if after key generation:

1. *p – 1* contains small factors,
2. *g* generates the full group of invertible elements, or at least a
   subgroup with enough small factors in the order,
3. *x* is a short exponent,

then secret key recovery may be possible at a significantly lower cost
than intended. This attack was already described in the 90s,[6](#fn:6) so
it is no surprise that it does not apply to any of the libraries we
analyzed: indeed, both safe primes and Lim–Lee primes block it,
because their only small factor is *2*.[7](#fn:7)

But the same idea can be applied to the ephemeral exponent *y*, and it
appears that this risk was overlooked in the OpenPGP ecosystem. In
practice, this leads to plaintext recovery in a context where two
OpenPGP libraries, one sender and one receiver, interact, and:

1. The receiver’s public key defines a prime such that ***p – 1* contains
   small factors**;
2. The receiver’s public key defines a generator *g* that generates the
   full group of invertible elements, or at least a **subgroup with enough
   small factors in the order**;
3. The sender’s library uses **short ephemeral exponents** *y*.

After computing the discrete log *y* as previously sketched,
recovering the plaintext message is an easy exercise.

Looking at [Table 1](#bingo) we see that two libraries, Libgcrypt and
Crypto++, can play the role of the sender, and that two types of
public keys, those named “DSA-like I” and “DSA-like III” can play the
role of the receiver in this attack.[8](#fn:8) Let that sink in: **any
message sent by GPG or Crypto++ in the past 20-something years to one
of 2,132 registered public PGP keys had weak or nonexistent security!**
Fortunately, that’s a quite small number of keys, but it accounts for
a good fraction of keys registered since 2016, and it is impossible to
say how many more unregistered keys may be at risk.

The feasibility of the attack depends on the number and size of the
small factors in the group order, as well as on the size of the short
exponents. So, for example, Crypto++ encrypted messages are always
more vulnerable than GPG messages. The [CCS ‘21
paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/923) contains a careful analysis
of the computational effort expected for each of the affected keys.
As a proof of concept, we picked the weakest key we could find in the
key dump and we encrypted a message to it using Crypto++. We were
able to **recover the plaintext in 2.5 hours on a single Intel
E5-2640 core**.

## FAQ [#](#faq)

### What kind of vulnerability did you find? [#](#what-kind-of-vulnerability-did-you-find)

In this first part we described a plaintext recovery attack on OpenPGP
ciphertexts encrypted with ElGamal. Only certain combinations of
sender and receiver software are exposed. We found that GPG (via
Libgcrypt) and Crypto++ are affected when acting as sender, while Go
is not.

We could not identify a specific library that would be affected when
acting as receiver, but an analysis of registered PGP public keys
shows that such libraries exist. Any message encrypted to their keys
by one of the weak sender libraries is at risk of being exposed.

### What is the attack scenario? [#](#what-is-the-attack-scenario)

This is a mathematical attack, thus it only requires interception of
ciphertexts. For example, ciphertexts may be gathered through a data
breach, or by snooping on an insecure network.

### Is the attack practical? [#](#is-the-attack-practical)

Running times for the attack vary depending on the sender’s software
and the receiver’s public key. They can go from a few hours on
commodity hardware to several CPU-years.

### How many people are affected? [#](#how-many-people-are-affected)

The attack is a combination of a specific behaviour of the software on the
sender side and certain mathematical properties of the public key of the
recipient of the encrypted transmission. While the weakness appears to be
very common on the sender side, we only found 2,132 registered public keys
to be affected, among more than 2 millions. It is likely that the
vulnerability only affects a small proportion of all OpenPGP
communications, however we cannot know how frequent the weakness is among
unregistered public keys.

### Am I affected? [#](#am-i-affected)

If you are a GPG (Libgcrypt) or Crypto++ user, the messages you send
or have sent may be at risk. Update to the latest version of GPG. A
fix for Crypto++ is upcoming. If you are unsure which library you are
using, or if you want to check whether your software has been patched,
you can use the [tool we provide
here](https://github.com/IBM/PGP-client-checker-CVE-2021-33560).

However, public keys generated by GPG and Crypto++ are not at risk, so
you do not need to revoke your ElGamal keys if you know they were
generated by one of these software.

If you are unsure which software generated your ElGamal key, read on.

### How do I tell if my ElGamal key is affected? [#](#how-do-i-tell-if-my-elgamal-key-is-affected)

It takes some computational resources to tell, with a reasonable
degree of confidence, whether a public key is affected or not. Thus we
are not able at the moment to provide a simple tool to test your keys.

If you cannot confirm that your key was safely generated, then we
recommend that you revoke it. To generate a new key we recommend
either GPG or Crypto++, and/or to use a different algorithm altogether
(*e.g.*, RSA or ECC).

2. In practice, RSA appears to be the most popular encryption
   scheme in the OpenPGP ecosystem, and ElGamal is expected to be
   eventually deprecated. [↩](#fnref:2)
3. This last one is an unusual choice, which an implementation
   could end up doing if it was simply taking a fixed *g* or drawing
   it at random, without further checks. Although unusual, it is
   unlikely to compromise security. [↩](#fnref:3)

   and van Oorschot and Wiener’s [“Parallel collision
   search”](https://doi.org/10.1007/PL00003816) algorithms to analyze
   the impact of our attacks. These can save a considerable amount
   of memory compared to Baby-step giant-step, and parallelize
   better, but they are not essential to understanding the attacks. [↩](#fnref:4)

7. We did not thoroughly test the harvested public keys for this
   weakness, but we dare hope that no library would make such a
   mistake today. [↩](#fnref:7)
8. The quasi-safe primes we observed do contain some small factors,
   but not enough to significantly affect security. [↩](#fnref:8)
