- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerable regular expression used in processing IMAP LIST commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  A regular expression vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular expression Denial of Service).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of Service (DoS). An attacker can craft malicious IMAP LIST commands that cause excessive CPU consumption.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting specific malicious IMAP LIST commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker must be an IMAP user who can send arbitrary IMAP LIST commands to the vulnerable server.
