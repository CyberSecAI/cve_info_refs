Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-40703:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an "Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer," which is also described by CWE-788. This means the software is attempting to read from or write to a memory location that is outside the bounds of an allocated buffer.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read/write, triggered when accessing memory outside of an allocated buffer. This is an example of improper memory handling.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current user. This implies an attacker could gain control over the application and potentially the system, depending on the user's privileges.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L). This suggests that the vulnerability is exploited on the local system. The specific trigger is not detailed in this document but would likely involve a specially crafted file or operation.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system. User interaction is required (UI:R), suggesting that the user needs to perform some action, such as opening a malicious file, to trigger the vulnerability. No special privileges are needed to exploit it (PR:N).

**Summary:**
CVE-2021-40703 is an out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability in Adobe Premiere Elements that could allow a local attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution by inducing a user to interact with a malicious file or operation within the application. The vulnerability is classified as critical.
