{
  "Root cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'state' field when updating a client profile.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Stored Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact": "Malicious JavaScript code can be injected and executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the client profile page. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/clients/profile` endpoint with a malicious script in the `state` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be able to submit form data to the `/clients/profile` endpoint. They also need a valid session to perform this request."
