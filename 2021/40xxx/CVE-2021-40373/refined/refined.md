Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-40373:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the lack of input sanitization within the `core_main_config` component of playSMS version 1.4.3 and below. Specifically, the `system()` function within PHP is used without proper input sanitization/validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Unsanitized Input:** The application allows users to inject PHP code into the configuration settings, which are then executed by the `system()` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Full System Compromise:** An attacker can gain complete control of the server running playSMS.
*   **Data Breach:** Sensitive data stored on the server can be accessed, modified, or deleted.
*   **Malware Deployment:**  The attacker could deploy malware or use the server for malicious activities like spamming or DDoS attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of playSMS, specifically the configuration page accessible through the URL structure:
    `http://127.0.0.1/index.php?app=main&inc=core_main_config&op=main_config#tabs-information-page`
*   **PHP Code Injection:** Attackers inject malicious PHP code (using the `system()` function with shell commands) into a configuration field accessible via the web interface.
*   **Wget & Shell Script:** This specific exploit uses the injected PHP to download a malicious shell script (rev.sh) from a remote server and then executes it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of playSMS (in the provided example, using the default admin credentials `admin:admin`).
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to both the playSMS server and be able to host the malicious script on a reachable server.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the specific vulnerable configuration page and how to inject PHP code.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided exploit specifically downloads and executes a reverse shell to gain access.
* PlaySMS version 1.4.5 and above addresses this security issue by not using the `system()` function directly in this manner.
* The information provided on the github page contains a proof of concept of the vulnerability and how to exploit it.
