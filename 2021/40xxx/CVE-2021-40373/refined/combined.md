Please note that upgrading from 1.4.3 to 1.4.5 is rather simple, no database update required:

   * Click here to get [playSMS 1.4.5](%5C%22https%3A//github.com/playsms/playsms/releases/tag/1.4.5%5C%22)
3. Exract the playsms-1.4.5.tar.gz (or 1.4.5.tar.g depends on how you download it) and run `./getcomposer.sh`
   * After extract you will see `playsms-1.4.5` forlder
   * cd inside the folder and run `./getcomposer.sh`, pay attention to the result and see if any errors occured
   * Updating the composer packages is important, do not miss it
4. Replace all web PHP files on your 1.4.3 installation folder with the new version
   * Make sure that you do not replace your own/existing `config.php`
   * Make sure that PHP files are replaced properly, especially files under `lib/` and `plugin/core/` folder
