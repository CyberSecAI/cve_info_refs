- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web server of affected devices transmits data without TLS encryption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing encryption of sensitive data (CWE-311).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read sensitive data, such as administrator credentials, or modify data in transit.
- **Attack vectors**: Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack on the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated remote attacker in a man-in-the-middle position.
