# Authenticated SQL injection in the Genesys iWD Manager (CVE-2021-40860 and CVE-2021-40861)

**Gabor Szivos, Nov. 26, 2021**

During a security assessment for one of our clients we discovered an authenticated SQL injection vulnerability in the [intelligent Workload Distribution (iWD)](https://docs.genesys.com/Documentation/IWD) system developed by [Genesys](https://www.genesys.com/).

The iWD-Manager had a filter function which enabled us to execute arbitrary SQL queries. In this case it was possible to dump the database via time-based blind SQL injection.

### iWD 9.0.012.08 - time- and boolean-based blind SQLi (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:H)

At the time of the testing the company used a slightly outdated version (9.0.012.08) of the iWD. As previously stated to enable efficient work with the large amount of data iWD has a filter function. As the following screenshot shows the user can define different matchers for different columns. The result of the search is returned as JSON.

![](https://sos-at-vie-1.exo.io/offensity-www-media/images/sqli_get_origi_marked.width-320.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=EXO62529db2da36e4e9a10b1db6%2F20250114%2Fat-vie-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250114T184718Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=554b4546e3597f0408c1665b47e8aa5e4de820b89d89d0b1560c8144a2b0c43c)

These matchers allowed not only binary matching, like "column1 = 'text'" or "column2 < 200" but complex ones as well, like the SQL operator "LIKE". The user defined filter was transmitted via the GET parameter *ql\_expression*.

At this point we got suspicious that this parameter might be taken as is and inserted into an SQL query without any kind of sanitization thus allowing SQL injection. After some trial and error it was clear, that we can access SQL functions like "CONCAT". It was time to take out the big guns and let sqlmap do its magic.

After a few minutes our suspicion was proven right. Sqlmap identified both a boolean-based and a time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability with the aforementioned ql\_expression parameter.

```
Parameter: ql_expression (GET)
    Type: boolean-based blind
    Title: AND boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause
    Payload: entity_dbid=6497&entity_type=solution&release_snapshot=4_23&ql_expression=column_1 LIKE CONCAT('%','value') ) AND 8894=8894 AND (8067=8067

    Type: time-based blind
    Title: Oracle AND time-based blind (heavy query)
    Payload: entity_dbid=6497&entity_type=solution&release_snapshot=4_23&ql_expression=column_1 LIKE CONCAT('%','value') ) AND 6204=(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ALL_USERS T1,ALL_USERS T2,ALL_USERS T3,ALL_USERS T4,ALL_USERS T5) AND (6962=6962
```

By exploiting this vulnerability we ware able to access the following information:

* name of the current user
* hostname of the database
* DB users
* list of databases
* list of tables
* list of columns
* content of tables (limited to the ones our user had access to)

Due to the nature of the underlying database engine (in our case Oracle) and its configuration it was not possible to insert, update or delete any data or execute OS commands.

### iWD 9.0.017.07 - time-based blind SQLi (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:H)

Due to the criticality of the issue it was reported to the customer immediately. As there were several newer versions of the software the customer decided to update to the - at the time - most current version (9.0.017.07) with the hopes that this issue was already fixed in an intermediate update.

The newer version indeed introduced some changes regarding the filtering function. For one it no longer used a GET request but a post one. The user defined filter was transmitted via the JSON object in the request body. Following screenshot shows an example request.

![](https://sos-at-vie-1.exo.io/offensity-www-media/images/sqli_post_origi_marked.width-320.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=EXO62529db2da36e4e9a10b1db6%2F20250114%2Fat-vie-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250114T184718Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=7b3f7b9b67e17050ef63e7cd150bb3e0743ed9d45da1e63eb6ed8e3972668c4c)

As it can be seen the filter expression was split up into three parts:

1. operator (LIKE, <, >, =, etc)
2. value (to which we compare the content of a column)
3. attribute (name of the column we are searching in)

We did not find any information in the release notes that this change was induced by a security issue thus we were confident the SQL injection vulnerability is still present but the payload has to be adapted. As manual experimentation was not successful we spun up sqlmap to find out if SQLi was still possible.

Lo and behold after a few minutes sqlmap identified a new payload which could be used to perform a time-based blind SQL injection:

```
Parameter: JSON value ((custom) POST)
    Type: time-based blind
    Title: Oracle time-based blind - Parameter replace (heavy queries)
    Payload: [{"operator":"LIKE","value":"(SELECT (CASE WHEN (8522=8522) THEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ALL_USERS T1,ALL_USERS T2,ALL_USERS T3,ALL_USERS T4,ALL_USERS T5) ELSE 8522 END) FROM DUAL)","attribute":"column1"}]
```

The impact of this "new" vulnerability is the same as for the version 9.0.012.08, we ware able to access internal information like hostname or the current user or dump the whole database.

Both issues were disclosed privately to the vendor (Genesys) in the form of a responsible disclosure. After some internal analysis they confirmed the existence of the vulnerability and released a [hotfix (9.0.018.05)](https://docs.genesys.com/Documentation/RN/9.0.x/iwd-manager90rn/iwd-manager9001805) on 21.10.2021 which resolves this issue. Although an attacker has to have access to the software to exploit this vulnerability we would recommend to update to the newest version nevertheless.

The following two CVE numbers were requested:

* [CVE-2021-40860](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-40860): Authetnicated SQLi in Genesys iWD < 9.0.013.11
* [CVE-2021-40861](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-40861): Authenticated SQLi in Genesys iWD between 9.0.013.11 and 9.0.017.07

### New in Release 8.5.0

### Re-architecting of IWD

Most of the deployment and configuration of iWD is now carried out carried out in the Genesys Administrator Extension (GAX) environment and the iWD GAX Plug-in. Some of the effects of this change are:

* Standardization of many of the procedures involved with deployment and configuration, using new components as well as a refreshed iWD Manager component.
* A completely new user configuration interface based on the Genesys Administrator Extension (GAX) plug-in.
* Removal of support for configuration using the Genesys Configuration Manager client.

Please see the **[Deployment Guide](https://docs.genesys.com/Documentation/IWD/8.5.0/Dep/NewIn850)** document for full details.

The changes are detailed as follows:

* iWD is now deployed by means of a new GAX Automatic Service Deployment (ASD) plug-in component called iWD Setup Utility.
* iWD configuration is now performed via Genesys Administrator Extension (GAX) and a new iWD GAX plug-in component. Specifically, the following aspects that were previously carried out in iWD Manager have now moved:
  + Tenant profile (to GAX)
  + Lookup tables (to iWD GAX Plugin)
  + Services (to iWD GAX Plugin)
  + Generic capture point (to GAX)
  + Data Mart Services (to iWD GAX Plugin)
  + Departments and processes (to iWD GAX Plugin)
  + Audit history (to a centralized log database, and with additional audit trail messages)
  + Security policy (to Genesys Administrator, using Genesys Role-Based Access Control (RBAC))

* The IWD Data Mart Services view is now replaced by a GAX dashboard monitoring the state of the Data Mart node.
* Data Mart now runs as a standalone Java module and is now managed directly using Solution Control Server.
* The modules and components mechanism is removed from iWD Manager.
* The Business Context Management Service (BCMS) functionality is moved to the Genesys Rules Engine.
* IWD Manager is now used primarily for task management and monitoring using the Global Task List.
* Support for legacy capture points is removed.

### Deployment/Configuration Using Genesys Administrator Extension

* Support for configuration using the Genesys Configuration Manager client is withdrawn in release 8.5.0.
* You must use Genesys Administrator Extension (GAX) together with the iWD GAX Plugin component for deployment and configuration in release 8.5.0.

### High Availability

* Support for Unresponsive Process Detection. iWD Data Mart has been enhanced to support detection of unresponsive processes (processes that appear to be running but for some reason is unable to provide service to its clients or peers.) Previously, LCA could detect only process termination in Data Mart. Now, SCS is alerted to the problem, and can take an action.

### Support for Customer/Partner Localization

* Products that support translation (those with localization kits) now permit customers/partners to apply their own translations to the user interface in cases where an official Genesys translation is not available.

### Localization Support

Localization for iWD Manager and iWD GAX Plug-in is now available for the following languages starting at release 8.5.000.15 for iWD Manager and 8.5.000.17 for iWD GAX Plug-In:

### iWD Web—Initial Release

iWD Web is a web-based, easy-to-deploy workload management solution. It enables organizations to automate and optimize the distribution and handling of tasks and increase workforce efficiency. Purpose-built to deliver rapid time to value, it provides the capability to upload task lists without the need to connect to other source systems, such as CRM, ERP, and legacy systems, leveraging export functionality commonly available to business users.

Instead of having to rely on manual task distribution to your team via spreadsheets (and also CSV files,) or team members having to pick their next work item manually from a CRM, ERP, or legacy system, iWD Web enables you to create new lists with task definitions based on data that business or operations managers can upload from .CSV, .XLS and .XLSX files. You can use your CRM, ERP, or legacy system's export to spreadsheet/CSV file feature to download a list of work items that your team needs to work on and import that file to iWD Web, which reads and treats every line of your spreadsheet as a task to be analyzed and properly distributed to your available team members.
See **[iWD Web Help](https://docs.genesys.com/Documentation/IWD/8.5.1/IWDWebHelp/Welcome)**.

### Additional browser support

iWD 8.5.102.03 components and iWD Web support the Safari 8.x browser.

## 8.5.101.03

### Integration with Genesys Hub

* **Single Sign-On**—iWD now participates in the Genesys Single Sign-On (SSO) framework where deployment takes place to a Genesys Engage cloud SSO environment. When iWD is deployed into this environment, iWD users will log in once to the portal. If they choose iWD Manager, they will bypass the login screen if they are still authenticated. Note that this feature does not apply for Genesys on-premise customers deploying iWD.
  This release fully integrates iWD with the Genesys Hub. The main features of this integration are:
  + An iWD app launcher on the Hub central navigation page.
  + Single sign-on (SSO)—A single login allows access to all applications where permissions are configured.
  + Single logout (SLO)—A single logout logs users out from all applications where they are logged in.
  + Simplified user provisioning.
  + Improvements to the user security model.
  + User rights created in iWD Manager are now transferred to Genesys Rules System Authoring Tool (GRAT) and handled there identically.

  Enabling and disabling of SSO/SLO is performed by editing properties in the iwd.properties file. See the Deployment Guide for implementation details.

### Setting User Access Roles across iWD and GRS

This feature enables administration-level users to set user access roles across iWD and GRS, enforcing consistent behaviour between them. Before the introduction of this feature, if you configured in IWD two roles—Manager1 and Manager 2—where Manager 1 is dedicated to Department 1 and Manager 2 is dedicated to Department 2, This feature enables administration-level users to set shared user access roles across iWD and GRS, enforcing consistent behavior between them. Before the introduction of this feature, if you configured in IWD two roles—Manager1 and Manager 2—where Manager 1 is dedicated to Department 1 and Manager 2 is dedicated to Department 2, these configuration constraints were not read correctly by iWD Manager. This meant that in iWD Manager, both Manager 1 and Manager 2 could see everything in both Departments. With this feature, roles are configured consistently across GRS and IWD.

### Support for Multiple Rule Packages in a Single ESP Call

The ESP interface with Genesys Rules Engines has been extended to allow a rules package to specify multiple rule package names in a single ESP call. Only the rule evaluation metrics for the last rule package will be returned. On an incoming request when the Service parameter is set to BusinessContextManagement and the Method parameter equals either SetBusinessContext, Prioritize, or Archive, the interface will accept multiple rule packages specified in the following format: rule.package1, rule.package2, rule.package3…… Task History for all rule packages has also been implemented.

## 8.5.100.02

### Support for Multiple Business Processes in one Tenant

* You can now create new business processes under the same Tenant. For example, interactions from different media types can be handled by separate business processes. To do this you clone the intelligent Workload Distribution Business Process (IWDBP) and edit names of the interaction queues (supplied out-of-box with iWD) for your needs. There are some additional configuration changes, including for Capture Points and Interaction Server. Please see further information in:
  + The **[Deployment Guide](https://docs.genesys.com/Documentation/IWD/8.5.1/Dep/IWDMultipleBP2)**
  + The **[Working with the iWDBP](https://docs.genesys.com/Documentation/IWD/8.5.1/IWDBusProc/Welcome)** document
  + The **[iWD Plug-in for GAX Help](http://docs.genesys.com/Documentation/IWD/8.5.1/GAXPluginHelp/BSList#t-1)** topics

### Support for PSDK 8.5

* The most recent 8.5 version of Genesys PSDK is supported in this release.

### New in Release 9.0.0

## 9.0.015

### iWD Data Mart

* Support for new dimensions, such as multimedia type and interaction type, has been added.
  + The core fact tables ([TASK\_WORK\_FACT](https://docs.genesys.com/Documentation/IWD/9.0.0/Ref/IWASK_WORK_FACTTables), [TASK\_FACT](https://docs.genesys.com/Documentation/IWD/9.0.0/Ref/IWDTASK_FACTTables)) have been expanded. They now allow you to describe facts with media type and interaction type.
  + Aggregate tables have been extended with new attributes:
    - MEDIA\_TYPE\_KEY for [Age](https://docs.genesys.com/Documentation/IWD/9.0.0/Ref/IWDTASK_AGE_FACTAggregate), [Agent](https://docs.genesys.com/Documentation/IWD/9.0.0/Ref/IWDTASK_AGENT_FACTAggregate), [Capt](https://docs.genesys.com/Documentation/IWD/9.0.0/Ref/IWDTASK_CAPT_FACTAggregate), [Classif](https://docs.genesys.com/Documentation/IWD/9.0.0/Ref/IWDTASK_CLASSIF_FACTAggregate) aggregate plugins.
    - INTERACTION\_TYPE\_KEY for [Agent](https://docs.genesys.com/Documentation/IWD/9.0.0/Ref/IWDTASK_AGENT_FACTAggregate) aggregate plugins.Starting with this release, Genesys strongly recommends using native plugins provided with iWD. Kettle aggregation plugins do NOT support dimensions added in this version. Use of custom Kettle plugins is fully supported.

* Support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is implemented.
* Support for Windows Server 2019 is implemented.
* Support for MSSQL Server 2019 is implemented.
* Support for PostgreSQL 10 is implemented.

## 9.0.010

* **iWD Manager**
  + **Support for custom attribute types**
    You can now configure custom attributes types in Genesys configuration layer. iWD Manager uses these types for validation in filter criteria and for proper display of task details. Configuration details are [here](https://docs.genesys.com/Documentation/IWD/Dep/iWDTaskAttribandIXProperties/9.0.0).
  + **ORS Business Process improvements**
    - The maximum number of retries to connect GRE/UCS is now restricted for the InvokeGRE and InvokeUCS strategies in order to prevent an infinite loop if GRE/UCS is down.
    - The iWD Business Process now properly handles ORS timeouts and GRE/UCS unavailability.
  + You can now create a bookmark for any page in the Global Task List (for example, for a custom filter).
* **iWD Data Mart reporting enhancements**
  + **Default Values**
    iWD Data Mart now calculates and aggregates tasks which are not yet [classified](https://docs.genesys.com/Documentation/IWD/IWDBusProc/IWDBPContents#scrollNav-2) or [prioritized](https://docs.genesys.com/Documentation/IWD/IWDBusProc/IWDBPContents#scrollNav-3) at the moment of aggregation.
  + **New configuration option**
    A new configuration option—**aggregation-delay-interval**—is introduced. You can now specify a number of minutes (in 15-minute increments—15, 30, 45, and so on) to be waited before aggregation. Setting this parameter helps to avoid getting default values (Unclassified, Unknown) in reports. Set the value to a sufficient amount of time to ensure pre-routing activity is already completed and all tasks' properties are populated.
  + **Pending Metrics**
    The calculation logic for some rare cases has been fixed.
  + **Real-time reporting**
    Real-time reporting metrics are now calculated over facts, not over aggregates. This means that real-time reporting will receive the latest processed data, even if an aggregation delay is set to more than 0 (zero) or if the aggregation process is delayed for some reason.
* Support for the following databases. See the [IWD](https://docs.genesys.com/Documentation/System/SOE/IWD) section in the *[Supported Operating Environment Reference Guide](https://docs.genesys.com/Documentation/System/SOE/Welcome)* for more detailed information and a list of all supported databases.

### Support for Interaction Server Cluster via Proxy

Before release 9.0, iWD supported multi-Interaction-Server deployments with tasks segmented into logical entities called Solutions. In this architecture, each Solution is handled by a single Interaction Server (possibly in primary-backup configuration) and each Interaction Server can handle multiple Solutions. iWD 9.0 expands this capability with an architecture where a single Solution can be handled by multiple Interaction Servers via an Interaction Server Proxy. [MORE INFORMATION](https://docs.genesys.com/Documentation/IWD/9.0.0/Dep/NewIn9)

### Support for Automated Import of XLS/CSV Files in iWD Web

In release 9.0, it is now possible to configure automatic import of .XLS, .XLSX and .CSV files with column headings, based on a time interval of the customer's choosing. Source systems export tasks/work items to a safe location that iWD Web can access. iWD Web checks for the presence of a new file in this location, checks the file format, then imports the individual tasks to iWD/Interaction Server for insertion into the Global Task List. Source-system-defined attributes can be mapped to any iWD attributes, according to the customer's configured mapping. Automatically uploaded jobs can be viewed (alongside any manual uploads) in the **Jobs List** tab of iWD Web. [MORE INFORMATION](https://docs.genesys.com/Documentation/IWD/9.0.0/Dep/NewIn9)
