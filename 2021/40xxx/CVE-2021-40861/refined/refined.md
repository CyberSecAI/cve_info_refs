  "CVE-2021-40861": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Authenticated SQL injection in Genesys iWD between versions 9.0.013.11 and 9.0.017.07",
    "details": [
      {
        "version": "9.0.012.08",
        "vulnerability": "time- and boolean-based blind SQLi",
         "root_cause": "The user-defined filter in the `ql_expression` GET parameter was inserted into an SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing for SQL injection.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Insufficient input sanitization",
          "Directly embedding user-controlled input into SQL queries"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker could dump the database via time-based blind SQL injection and access sensitive information including:  names of current users, hostname of the database, DB users, list of databases, tables, columns and content of tables (limited to the user's access).",
        "attack_vector": "The attack vector was the `ql_expression` parameter in a GET request",
         "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker required prior authenticated access to the iWD Manager application. SQL knowledge, familiarity with SQL injection techniques, and usage of automated tools such as SQLmap were beneficial."

        "version": "9.0.017.07",
        "vulnerability": "time-based blind SQLi",
        "root_cause": "Even after changes to the filtering function (moving from GET to POST requests with a JSON payload), the application still lacked sufficient input sanitization. The 'value' field in the JSON payload was vulnerable.",
         "weaknesses": [
          "Insufficient input sanitization",
          "Directly embedding user-controlled input into SQL queries, even within JSON payloads"
        ],
         "impact": "An attacker could still dump the database and access sensitive information by exploiting the time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability.",
         "attack_vector": "The attack vector was the 'value' parameter within a JSON object in the POST request body.",
         "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker required prior authenticated access to the iWD Manager application. SQL knowledge, familiarity with SQL injection techniques, and usage of automated tools such as SQLmap were beneficial."
