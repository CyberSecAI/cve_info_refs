Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-40031:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference within the camera module.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A null pointer dereference exists. This occurs when the code attempts to access memory through a pointer that is currently pointing to null (address 0), which can lead to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect service integrity. This indicates that the application or service utilizing the camera module might become unstable or unusable.

**Attack vectors:**
- The document does not explicitly mention the attack vector, but it is inferred that this is related to the camera module.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The document does not specify any required attacker capabilities. However, since it's a software vulnerability, it is likely that the attacker needs some level of control over the input to the camera module or be able to trigger the specific code path leading to the null pointer dereference.

**Affected Versions:**
- EMUI 12.0.0
- EMUI 11.0.0
- Magic UI 4.0.0
