RCE Security Advisory
<https://www.rcesecurity.com>

1. ADVISORY INFORMATION
=======================
Product:        Reolink E1 Zoom Camera
Vendor URL:     <https://reolink.com/product/e1-zoom/>
Type:           Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor [CWE-200]
Date found:     2021-08-26
Date published: 2022-06-01
CVSSv3 Score:   7.5 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
CVE:            CVE-2021-40149

2. CREDITS
==========
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Julien Ahrens from
RCE Security.

3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
====================
Reolink E1 Zoom Camera 3.0.0.716 (latest) and below

4. INTRODUCTION
===============
Meet new generation of Reolink E1 series. Advanced features - 5MP Super
HD & optical zoom are added into this compact camera. Plus two-way audio,
remote live view and more smart capacities help you connect with what you
care. Be closer to families and be away from worries.

(from the vendor's homepage)

5. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
========================
The web server of the E1 Zoom camera through 3.0.0.716 discloses its SSL private
key via the root web server directory.

An unauthenticated attacker can abuse this with network-level access to the
camera to download the webserver's private SSL key by simply going to the
following URL:

http://[CAM-IP]/self.key

6. RISK
=======
An unauthenticated attacker can download the webserver's SSL private key and
thereby attack the encrypted network traffic to and from the camera, which might
lead to the disclosure of the administrative access credentials and other
sensitive information.

7. SOLUTION
===========
None.
