The provided content relates to CVE-2021-40818.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `check_attestation_fido_u2f` function within the `webauthn.c` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A fixed-size stack buffer `data_signed[200]` was used to store data of variable length without proper bounds checking. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the combined size of `rpid_hash_len`, `client_data_hash_len`, `credential_id_len`, `cert_x_len`, and `cert_y_len` exceeds 200.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A buffer overflow can lead to a crash, or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the WebAuthn registration process, when processing the attestation data from a FIDO U2F authenticator.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to control or manipulate the parameters of the WebAuthn registration process and the data received from the FIDO U2F device to cause a larger than expected value in any of the length variables.
