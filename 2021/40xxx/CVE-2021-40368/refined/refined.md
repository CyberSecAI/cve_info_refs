- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation when handling specially crafted packets sent to port 102/tcp.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient input validation leading to a memory buffer issue (CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition, requiring a restart of the device to restore normal operations.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks targeting port 102/tcp with specially crafted packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to port 102/tcp on the vulnerable devices. No authentication or user interaction is needed.
