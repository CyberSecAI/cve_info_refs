SSA-557541: Denial-of-Service Vulnerability in SIMATIC S7-400 CPUs

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.5

2022-04-12
2023-04-11
V1.2

SUMMARY

SIMATIC S7-400 CPU devices contain an input validation vulnerability that could allow an attacker to
create a Denial-of-Service condition. A restart is needed to restore normal operations.

Siemens has released an update for SIMATIC S7-410 V10 CPU family and SIMATIC S7-400 H V6 CPU
family (incl. SIPLUS variants for both) and recommends to update to the latest version. Siemens is
preparing further updates and recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are
not yet available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Limit access to port 102/tcp to trusted users and systems only

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC S7-400 controllers have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial environ-
ments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-40368

Affected devices improperly handle specially crafted packets sent to port 102/tcp.

This could allow an attacker to create a Denial-of-Service condition. A restart is needed to restore
normal operations.
