Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-40121:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper validation of user-supplied input within the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code into the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Script Execution: A successful exploit can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the context of the web interface.
- Sensitive Information Access: An attacker could potentially access sensitive browser-based information, such as cookies or session tokens.
- Potential for further malicious activity: If the attacker gains access to session tokens, it could lead to account hijacking.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- Injection: An attacker injects malicious code into specific pages of the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated Access: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrative privileges. This is a key distinction from CVE-2021-34738 which does not require authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) software.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Medium" severity.
- The provided CVSS vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N.
