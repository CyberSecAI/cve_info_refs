The provided content relates to CVE-2021-40636.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `CheckDuplicateName.php` file. Specifically, parameters `table_name`, `field_name`, `id`, and `field_id` are not sanitized, allowing for SQL injection. The `msg` parameter also lacks sanitization, enabling XSS attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Unsanitized parameters allow attackers to inject SQL queries to extract information, manipulate data, or potentially perform other database operations.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of sanitization on the `msg` parameter allows injection of arbitrary JavaScript code, enabling attackers to steal user cookies or perform other malicious actions within the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database. The provided example demonstrates extracting the database name.
*  **XSS:**  Attackers could steal user cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking and account takeover.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers send crafted HTTP GET requests to `CheckDuplicateName.php` with malicious SQL queries embedded in parameters like `table_name`.
*   **XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript into the `msg` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `CheckDuplicateName.php` script.
*   No special privileges are mentioned as required beyond accessing the vulnerable script.
