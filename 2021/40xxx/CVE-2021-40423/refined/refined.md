- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the `cgiserver.cgi` command parser. Specifically, the `body_request_to_command` function checks if the "cmd" key in a JSON request is a string, and if not, it does not process the request. These unprocessed requests stay in the request queue until a timeout occurs, and if enough of these requests are sent simultaneously, the server becomes unable to handle new requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper input validation, and by how the requests are managed. The program allows an attacker to send requests that won't get processed, and the queue holding these requests has limited capacity, leading to denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition, rendering the camera's API unreachable.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specially crafted HTTP requests with a JSON body where the "cmd" key is not a string to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi?cmd=Login` endpoint of the Reolink camera.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the camera on the network. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.
