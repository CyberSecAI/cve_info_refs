{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The presence of two hardcoded backdoor passwords within the firmware of Auerswald COMpact PBX devices.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Hardcoded backdoor passwords for the 'Schandelah' and 'Admin' user accounts. These passwords cannot be disabled and are calculated using the device's serial number, current date, and language settings.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Full administrative access to the device, allowing attackers to completely compromise the PBX. This includes the ability to download device backups, configure audio recording, and reset user passwords.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network access to the web-based management interface of the PBX.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the device's web interface. No prior authentication is required to obtain the information needed to derive the passwords."
