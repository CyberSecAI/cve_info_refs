Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-40701:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Access of memory location after the end of a buffer. This is a classic buffer overflow or out-of-bounds write scenario.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds memory access (CWE-788). This suggests a lack of proper bounds checking when reading or writing to memory buffers, which allows for access beyond the allocated region.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current user. This could allow an attacker to gain control of the affected system and perform malicious actions.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L). The vulnerability is likely triggered by a malformed file processed by Adobe Premiere Elements or through some local interaction with the application.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system to exploit the vulnerability (PR:N), and user interaction is required (UI:R), where the user must open a malformed file or interact with the program to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as "Critical".
*   The CVSS base score is 7.8 with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating high impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
*   The affected versions are Adobe Premiere Elements 2021 (build 19.0 (20210127.daily.2235820) and earlier) on both Windows and macOS.
*   The fix is an update to Adobe Premiere Elements 2021 build 19.0 (20210809.daily.2242976).
*   The vulnerability was reported by CFF of Topsec Alpha Team (cff\_123).
