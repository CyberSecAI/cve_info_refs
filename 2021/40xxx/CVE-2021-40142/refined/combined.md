Security Bulletins
# Security Bulletins

## Overview

The OPC Foundation publishes security bulletins that affect software that it maintains or distributes. In many cases these bulletins will affect code that OPC vendors incorporate into their products. As a result, vendors will have to patch their products to address the vulnerabilities identified.

**Any vulnerabilities or security concerns should be reported to ‘securityteam AT opcfoundation DOT org’**.

A PGP key to encrypt any sensitive security report can be found [here](https://files.opcfoundation.org/SecurityBulletins/securityteam_public_key.txt).

## Process

When an issue is reported, the OPC Foundation uses the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document) to rate vulnerability and requests a CVE number from [MITRE](https://cve.mitre.org/). Vendors are encouraged to use the CVE number when they publish updates to their products so users can associate a product patch with a vulnerability reported by the OPC Foundation.

When vulnerabilities are reported they are first reviewed by the OPC UA Security WG to determine the best course of action. A notice is sent out to a SDK vendor mailing list that an issue has been reported that may require action on their part. SDK vendors receive advance notice because many OPC products are built with SDKs and addressing a vulnerability requires that the SDKs be updated first. Any OPC Foundation member that wishes to be informed before vulnerabilities are made public should send a request to join the [UA Security WG](https://apps.opcfoundation.org/faq/WorkingGroups.htm).

After review, the Security WG will set a time line for making the vulnerability public. The time line will depend on the severity of the vulnerability and the time needed by SDK vendors to produce a patch for their products. When a vulnerability is made pubic it will appear on this page with details on where to find updated software. Any member of the public who wishes to receive notifications when new Security Bulletins are released to the public should join the [OPC Security Bulletins Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum#!forum/opcsecuritybulletins "OPC Security Bulletins Google Group").

When a vulnerability is made public, the OPC Foundation will notify [MITRE](https://cve.mitre.org/).which means it will be made visible in their [database](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/). NIST will also automatically add the CVE to their [database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search).

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Deactivate the OPC LDS Service if supported by the product use case. The LDS service is not

activated in the default configuration

• Use VPN for protecting network communication between cells

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

OpenPCS 7 is an OPC-compliant connection to business planning and operations control systems.
OpenPCS 7 provides a direct connection to MES and MOM systems.

SIMATIC Process Historian is the long term archive system for SIMATIC PCS 7, SIMATIC WinCC and
SIMATIC PCS neo. It stores process values, alarms and batch data of production plants in its database
and offers historical process data to reporting and visualization applications.

SIMATIC NET PC software is a software product that is sold separately and implements the communica-
tions product from SIMATIC NET.

SIMATIC WinCC is a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system.

SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional is a visualization runtime platform used for operator control and
monitoring of machines and plants.

SIMATIC WinCC Unified PC Runtime is the new visualization runtime platform used for operator control
and monitoring of machines and plants.

TeleControl Server Basic allows remote monitoring and control of plants.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory. Wherever
applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-40142

In OPC Foundation Local Discovery Server (LDS) before 1.04.402.463, remote attackers can cause
a denial of service condition by sending carefully crafted messages that lead to access of a memory
location after the end of a buffer.
