  "vulnerability_information": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-40344",
    "description": "An insecure file upload in Nagios XI allows an administrator to upload and execute PHP code.",
    "root_cause": "The application only checks the MIME type of uploaded files against a whitelist, but does not validate the file extension. This allows an attacker to upload a file with a malicious extension (e.g., PHP) while using a valid MIME type (e.g., image/jpeg).",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure file upload",
        "MIME type validation bypass",
         "Lack of file extension validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with administrator privileges can upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to remote code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack is performed via a web interface using a crafted HTTP POST request.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have administrator privileges to access the Custom Includes section of the Admin panel. Knowledge of crafting a file that bypasses the MIME type validation is required."
