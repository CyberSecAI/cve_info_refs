- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the cgi function of the Artica Proxy, specifically within the `/cgi-bin/main.cgi` component, which is a built-in part of the proxy,  allowing directory traversal via the `filename` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Relative path traversal (CWE-23) leading to improper limitation of pathname to a restricted directory (CWE-22)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure due to the ability to traverse directories and access sensitive files.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a web browser by crafting a specific URL that includes the traversal sequence.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable service, specifically, they need to be able to reach the product's URL. A low privileged user is sufficient.
