- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A read access violation occurs during a block data move (memcpy) operation within the `libgstreamer-1.0-0.dll` module when parsing a crafted MP3 file. This is potentially a stack overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a Read Access Violation during the `memcpy` function, specifically at `memcpy+0x265`, when processing a malformed MP3 file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can cause a crash (DoS) of the `clementine.exe` process or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the currently logged-in Windows user.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a crafted MP3 file or by loading a remote stream URL that contains a malicious MP3 file that is not properly handled by Clementine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious MP3 file, and either convince a user to open the file or to load a remote URL containing that file with Clementine.
