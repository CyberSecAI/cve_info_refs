The provided content relates to CVE-2021-40656.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `error_diffuse` function within `src/quant.c`. The vulnerability occurs due to out-of-bounds write when diffusing color errors. Specifically, when processing an image with a width of 1, the code attempts to access `pos + width * 1 - 2` which can result in a negative index, leading to an access before the beginning of the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow due to incorrect index calculation within the error diffusion routine.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption leading to potential crashes. The provided ASAN report shows an `AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow` followed by an `ABORTING`, indicating a crash.
- Potential denial of service due to the crash
- Potential for more severe security issues depending on the context where the code is used and the attacker's ability to influence the heap layout

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing a specially crafted image using the `img2sixel` tool. The provided PoC file (`poc.zip`) can be used to trigger the vulnerability.
- The `img2sixel` command line tool is used with the following flags to trigger the bug:  `-o ./a.sixel -7 -p 1 -C 5 -d stucki -E size`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide an input image to `libsixel` via `img2sixel` or another program using the library, specifically one that triggers the faulty error diffusion logic (width = 1).
- No special permissions or user interaction is required.
