{
  "CVE-ID": "CVE-2021-40171",
  "Root cause": "The system lacks proper protection against replay attacks in its proprietary RF communication protocol.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Lack of replay protection mechanisms in the RF protocol.",
    "Insecure communication channel susceptible to eavesdropping and replay attacks."
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker can disarm an armed system or trigger false alarms by replaying captured RF signals, potentially compromising the security of the premises.",
    "Attack vectors": [
    "Capturing valid RF signals during normal system operation (e.g., arming/disarming, triggering sensors).",
    "Replaying the captured signals using a software-defined radio (SDR)."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Physical proximity to the system to capture RF signals.",
    "Basic knowledge of SDR usage and RF signal capturing."
  ],
  "Additional details": "The report details the process of identifying the RF frequency, capturing signals with a HackRF SDR, and reverse engineering the protocol to understand its structure. The vulnerability was confirmed by successfully replaying captured signals to disarm/arm the system and trigger sensor events. No time-stamps or rolling code mechanisms were found.",
    "More Info": "This report provides more technical details than the official CVE description."
