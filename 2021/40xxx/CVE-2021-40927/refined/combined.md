# Spotifious

## a natural Spotify controller for Alfred

[![The magical interface](/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred/raw/master/include/screenshots/hero_shot.png)](/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred/blob/master/include/screenshots/hero_shot.png)

So, you've heard of **Spotifious**, eh? *A natural Spotify controller for
Alfred*? Searches Spotify, controls your music, generally rocks?

It's built off a lot of other people's work—
[PHPFunk](https://github.com/phpfunk/alfred-spotify-controls) and
[David Ferguson](http://jdfwarrior.tumblr.com/) especially— and tries to match
the functionality of Alfred's integrated iTunes player. It's not perfect, but it does the job. And I think it's pretty cool.

## Features

A quick rundown of its coolness:

### A controller, not a workflow

Spotifious just *feels* fun to use, like a real plugin for Alfred, not a workflow. It
can do in-depth, album-scouring searches and gives you useful information even if something goes wrong. Filter by artist or album, search for specific tracks or just plain see what's playing. It's all there.

Not unlike the iTunes Mini Player.

### Alfred-like

Spotifious is also especially Alfred-like. Just start typing to scour Spotify's servers for music. Browse through artists and albums like nobody's business and drill down through Queen's huge anthologies with a snappy context-based search and filtering. Your frequent searches rise to the top, and your controls pop up with the letter `c`.

### Smart

Spotifious uses Packal to make sure you always have the latest version. It gives you a heads-up about what's going on with Spotify *the moment you start it*. And don't worry about errors— we'll handle those. All you have to do is choose how you want to pop it up on screen.

## Download & Install

Latest version: [v0.13.9](https://github.com/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred/archive/master.zip) | Latest dev build: [v0.13.9](https://github.com/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred/archive/dev.zip)

An in-depth [installation guide](http://ben.stolovitz.com/Spotify-for-Alfred/download/) is available on the Spotifious website.

1. [Download](https://github.com/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred/archive/master.zip)
   this repository.
2. Open `Spotifious.alfredworkflow` in the `dist` folder by double-clicking it or dragging it into
   Alfred.
3. Double-click the first thingy marked `Hotkey`.
4. Click the textfield labeled `Hotkey` and press `^⌘⏎`.
5. Click `Save` to store the binding.
6. Bind the other hotkeys as you wish. Their actions are visible in the `Text` field, under `Argument`.
7. Pop up Spotifious with the key command you set— I would have `^⌘⏎`.
8. Follow the instructions on the set-up menu.
   1. You'll be asked to choose your country (for better search results— you can opt out).
   2. You'll create a Spotify application (or not, you can opt out).
   3. You'll link the new app to Spotifious.
9. Continue on with your merry day— but now with Spotifious.

[![A visual install guide](/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred/raw/master/include/screenshots/install.png)](/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred/blob/master/include/screenshots/install.png)

## How to Use

So let's assume you've downloaded and installed the workflow. Now what?

1. Press `^⌘⏎`.

Good! You should briefly see a loading entry, then the main menu:

[![Loading...](/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred/raw/master/include/screenshots/loading.png)](/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred/blob/master/include/screenshots/loading.png)
[![Main Menu](/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred/raw/master/include/screenshots/main_menu.png)](/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred/blob/master/include/screenshots/main_menu.png)

You can action the song title (press `⏎`) to play or pause the song, action
the album or artist to search for that album or artist, or just start typing to
search for cool music.

[![Some cool screenshots](/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred/raw/master/include/screenshots/compilation.png)](/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred/blob/master/include/screenshots/compilation.png)

Once you've searched for something, you can continue to browse albums and arists through Spotifious. Actioning an artist will bring up a list of their albums, and actioning an album will bring up the track list.

If you're looking through a really long album or a particularly prodigious artist, you can also narrow your search by typing a little more— Spotifious will search for results within the album or artist.

**Note:** You can always leave a menu and go back just by pressing `⌫`.

You can access a small controls menu by typing `c` at the main menu.

[![A preview of the controls menu](/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred/raw/master/include/screenshots/controls.png)](/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred/blob/master/include/screenshots/controls.png)

You can change your settings by typing `s` at the main menu.

## Acknowledgements

A lot of people helped out on this:

* **vdesabou** and I trade ideas a ton
* **PHPfunk** and his PHP Alfred workflow inspired much of `OhAlfred`
* **David Ferguson** helped with some iffy Alfred glitches
* **jwilsson**'s [Spotify PHP web API](http://jwilsson.github.io/spotify-web-api-php/).
* a slightly modified version of [Entypo](http://www.entypo.com/) icon font face for icons.
* and many other people mentioned in the code.

Thanks to everyone who helped, and thanks to everyone who uses my work!
Oh, and thanks for reading this whole README. I hope you enjoy Spotifious!

## Development

You must install dependencies manually. Install
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and then run `make init`. Then you can
proceed with development! (if you do not want to do a global install, run
`php composer.phar install` from this directory)

Command line development for Alfred 3 is currently not working, since we
depend on several environment variables. Eventually, if you are developing for
Alfred version 3 and want to run these files from
the command line (`php -f main.php -- "args"`), you will need to run in debug
mode : `DEBUG=true php -f main.php -- "args"`.

### Deployment

1. Bump version here
2. Update `CHANGELOG`
3. Update `.alfredworkflow` version
4. Update Alfred forum
5. Update Packal
6. Update GitHub Pages site

## TODO

* Allow `⎇`, `^`, and `⌘` to function as modifiers (Open in Spotify, other things?).
* More in-depth Spotify control (radio, queuing, playlists)
* Make main menu links go directly to menus.

## Changelog

This project uses pseudo-SemVer. It will use SemVer when we hit v1.0.0.

See `CHANGELOG.md`.

### **[seongil-wi](/seongil-wi)** commented [Sep 13, 2021](#issue-994362732)

| **Describe the bug** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) may allow an attacker to execute JavaScript code in the context of the victim’s browser. This may lead to unauthorized actions being performed, unauthorized access to data, stealing of session information, denial of service, etc. An attacker needs to coerce a user into visiting a link with the XSS payload to be properly exploited against a victim.  **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior:   1. Access to the following link: <http://143.248.249.43/Spotify-for-Alfred/callback.php?error=%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E> 2. Boom!   **Where the Issue Occurred** The code below displays the user-controlled parameter `error` without sufficient sanitization:   [Spotify-for-Alfred/callback.php](https://github.com/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred/blob/941631eba0c581d38632a05d0e0101c438f1730d/callback.php#L50)  Line 50 in [941631e](/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred/commit/941631eba0c581d38632a05d0e0101c438f1730d)   |  | Error: <code><?php print $\_GET['error']; ?></code> | | --- | --- | |

| This server is only ever run during Spotify setup, and there is no information to steal on this page.  EDIT: Further info: I don't think this is a necessary fix, though it should be simple enough to sanitize the string. I don't plan to make any changes here. Thank you for reporting this, though! |
