Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the Zoom installer's failure to properly validate the signature of non-executable files within the `Zoom.msi` archive. Specifically, while the installer checks the signatures of executable files and libraries (PE files), it does not perform the same check on script files, such as `.bat` or `.ps1` (PowerShell) files, allowing an attacker to embed malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Signature Validation:** The installer only validates signatures for executable files and libraries but not for scripts.
*   **Lack of Script File Verification:** The installer does not verify the contents or trustworthiness of included script files.
*   **Bypass of Antivirus:**  The use of a legitimate installer with an embedded malicious script helps bypass many antivirus engines, including next-generation antivirus, as they often rely on user behavior analysis.
*   **Registry Manipulation:** The attack leverages the ability to modify the Windows registry, which allows for persistence of the malicious script.
*   **PowerShell Execution Bypass:** The attack bypasses restrictions on executing remote PowerShell scripts by setting the PowerShell execution policy to "Unrestricted"

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation leads to remote code execution on the victim's machine. The attacker gains a reverse shell, which allows them to execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Full System Control:** Once the reverse shell is established, the attacker gains control over the victim's laptop, enabling them to perform malicious activities, exfiltrate data, etc.
*   **Persistence:** By modifying the Windows registry to launch the script at startup, the attacker achieves persistence of their malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Phishing Email:** The attack begins with a phishing email designed to trick the target into downloading the malicious Zoom installer.
*   **Spoofed Website:** The phishing email directs the victim to a spoofed Zoom website that appears legitimate.
*   **Malicious Installer:** The victim downloads and executes a modified Zoom installer containing the malicious scripts embedded inside Zoom.msi

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to craft a convincing phishing email to entice the victim to download the malicious installer.
*   **Reverse Engineering:** The attacker needs to reverse engineer the Zoom installer to identify the vulnerability, i.e. the missing script file signature verification.
*   **Malware Development:** The attacker needs to create a reverse shell and embed it within the legitimate Zoom installer, along with a way to launch it.
*   **Infrastructure Setup:** The attacker needs to set up a server to receive the reverse shell connections.
*   **Domain Spoofing:** The attacker needs to register a domain name to mimic the legitimate Zoom website.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to Zoom on December 22, 2020, and was supposedly fixed in version 5.5.4.
*   The provided document details a real red team operation by ManoMano's security team leveraging this zero-day vulnerability.
*   The article provides in-depth technical details about the preparation and execution of the attack.
*   The use of PowerShell obfuscation is highlighted to bypass common detections.
*   The article also describes how the team bypassed restrictions on remote PowerShell script execution and the need to use a trampoline batch file to call the malicious Powershell script at startup.
