    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-34775",
    "summary": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) implementation for Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches. An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker could cause LLDP database corruption on the affected device. The vulnerabilities are due to missing length validation checks when processing LLDP messages. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious LLDP packet to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an out-of-bounds read of the valid LLDP packet data, which could allow the attacker to cause corruption in the internal LLDP database of the affected device.",
