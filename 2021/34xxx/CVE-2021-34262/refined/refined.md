{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `USBH_ParseEPDesc` function in `usbh_ctlreq.c` does not check if the `ep_descriptor->wMaxPacketSize` is greater than zero.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of input validation",
      "Unchecked value of wMaxPacketSize"
    ],
    "impact": "The system will hang when trying to communicate with the endpoint if `ep_descriptor->wMaxPacketSize` is zero. This leads to a denial-of-service.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious USB device can provide an endpoint descriptor with a `wMaxPacketSize` of zero.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted USB device that presents an endpoint descriptor with a wMaxPacketSize of 0. This could be achieved by a compromised USB device or a specially crafted device."
  },
  "additional_information": {
    "patch_information": "The fix was published in the v1.10.0 release, which included checking if `ep_descriptor->wMaxPacketSize` is greater than zero.",
    "affected_component": "STM32CubeH7 USB Host Library",
    "affected_function": "static void USBH_ParseEPDesc(USBH_EpDescTypeDef *ep_descriptor, uint8_t *buf)"
