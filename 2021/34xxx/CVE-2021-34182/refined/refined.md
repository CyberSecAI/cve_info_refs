Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-34182:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the default configuration of ttyd v1.6.3, which, when permissions are set, allows for unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Default Configuration:** The primary issue is that the default configuration of ttyd exposes the application in a way that allows for unauthorized access and remote command execution.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** It appears that the application doesn't properly validate or restrict inputs, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
- **Insufficient Access Control:**  The default permissions configuration does not prevent unauthorized access, and does not follow the principle of least privilege

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server where ttyd is running.
- **Complete System Compromise:** The ability to execute arbitrary code can lead to complete compromise of the affected system, data breaches, malware installation, and other malicious activities.
- **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow attackers to read sensitive data (confidentiality), modify system configurations and files (integrity), and cause denial-of-service (availability).

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network (as indicated by CVSS vector "AV:N").
- **Remote Exploitation:** Attackers can exploit this issue remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior privileges or credentials on the target system to exploit the vulnerability (as indicated by CVSS vector "PR:N").
- **No User Interaction Required:** No user interaction is required for the exploit to be successful (as indicated by CVSS vector "UI:N").

**Additional Notes**
- The maintainer of ttyd initially did not consider this a bug but later addressed it by changing the default settings.
-  The issue was reported on June 1, 2021, and a fix was introduced on Apr 27, 2023 by not exposing the port publicly by default.
-  The vulnerability is rated as critical with a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating its severity.
- The issue is tracked under Github issue #692.
- The vulnerability is also associated with CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions).
