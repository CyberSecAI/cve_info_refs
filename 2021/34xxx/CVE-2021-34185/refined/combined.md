| Hi Team,  Integer based buffer overflow caused by out-of-bound left shift is observed in [miniaudio.h](https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio/blob/master/miniaudio.h) while fuzzing **MINIAUDIO (v0.10.35 and master branch)** using **UBSAN** enabled in **AFL FUZZER**  **Vulnerable code from miniaudio.h -**  DRWAV\_API drwav\_uint32 drwav\_bytes\_to\_u32(const drwav\_uint8\* data) { return (data[0] << 0) | (data[1] << 8) | (data[2] << 16) | (data[3] << 24); }  **Steps to Reproduce -**  cd examples  afl-gcc -fsanitize=address -fsanitize=leak -fsanitize=undefined simple\_looping.c -o simple\_looping -ldl -lm -lpthread  ./simple\_looping POC2  Download link to [POC2](https://github.com/x00x00x00x00/miniaudio/raw/main/POC2)  **OUTPUT -**  ../miniaudio.h:52991:73: runtime error: left shift of 128 by 24 places cannot be represented in type 'int'  **Request team to implement proper patch and validate** |

| Thank for the report. This is coming from the dr\_wav project in dr\_libs. I've gone ahead and pushed an update to the dev branch and it'll be released soon. Feel free to reopen this issue if the issue still hasn't been fixed. |
