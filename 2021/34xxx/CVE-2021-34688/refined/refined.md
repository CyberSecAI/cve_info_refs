Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2021-34688:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The RemotePC application stores an encrypted version of the system's Personal Key in world-readable log files located in the `%PROGRAMDATA%` directory.
*   The encryption is performed using a hard-coded static key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure (CWE-200):** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive information (the Personal Key) through inadequate protection.
*   **Weak Encryption:** The use of a hard-coded static key makes the encryption easily reversible.
*   **World-Readable Log Files:** The log files containing the encrypted key are accessible to any local user, facilitating the attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A locally authenticated attacker can obtain the Personal Key.
*   This could allow the attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access to the system and control it.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the target machine.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs to access the log files in `%PROGRAMDATA%`.
*   **Reverse Encryption:** The attacker must be able to reverse the static-key encryption.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a locally authenticated user on the system running the vulnerable version of RemotePC for Windows.
*   The attacker should be able to read files within the `%PROGRAMDATA%` folder.
*   The attacker requires technical skills to reverse the static-key encryption.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content offers more detail than a basic CVE description, including the specific location of the log files and the method of encryption.
* The affected versions are RemotePC for Windows before 7.6.48.
* The patched version is RemotePC for Windows 7.6.48.
