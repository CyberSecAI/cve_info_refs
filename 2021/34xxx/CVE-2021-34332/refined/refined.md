- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `BMP_Loader.dll` library lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing BMP files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An infinite loop condition can be triggered.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A denial of service condition due to excessive resource consumption.
- **Attack vectors**: By enticing a user to open a malformed BMP file using the affected applications.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious file, and the user must open it with the vulnerable software.
