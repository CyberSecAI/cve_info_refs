Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-34860:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path provided in the `getpage` parameter to the `webproc` endpoint, before using it in file operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory traversal vulnerability: The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths that are then used in file operations. This is a type of path traversal vulnerability.
- Information Disclosure:  The ability to specify arbitrary paths allows an attacker to read sensitive files on the system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can disclose sensitive information within the context of the root user. This may include system configuration files, credentials, or other critical data.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through a network-adjacent attack vector, meaning that the attacker needs to be within the same network as the device to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attack is performed through the webproc endpoint, specifically the `getpage` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a network-adjacent position to the vulnerable device.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, making it easier to exploit.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerable device is the D-Link DAP-2020 router running firmware v1.01.
- A hot-fix firmware (v1.03rc004 Beta) is available to correct this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by chung96vn of Vietnam National Cyber Security Center.
- The vulnerability was reported to D-Link on 2021-03-12.
