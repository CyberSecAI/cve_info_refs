- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin's file upload functionality only checked the last file extension, allowing for "double extension" attacks. An attacker could upload a file like `info.php.png` which, on some server configurations, would be treated as executable PHP code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authenticated file upload vulnerability. Inadequate file extension validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote Code Execution (RCE) on vulnerable servers.
- **Attack vectors**: Uploading a file with a double extension (e.g., `file.php.png`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the `upload_files` capability (e.g., an author). The attacker also needs a specific server configuration using `AddHandler` or `AddType` directives to execute the uploaded file.
