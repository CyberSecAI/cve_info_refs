Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Linux Kernel's handling of eBPF programs. Specifically, there is a lack of proper validation of user-supplied eBPF programs. This leads to a type confusion condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Type confusion vulnerability due to insufficient validation of user-supplied eBPF programs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to:
    - Disclosure of sensitive information
    - Addition or modification of data
    - Denial of Service (DoS)
    - Privilege escalation
    - Execution of arbitrary code in the context of the kernel

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attackers with the ability to execute low-privileged code can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in Linux Kernel version 5.13.14.
- NetApp products that incorporate vulnerable Linux Kernel versions are affected, specifically:
    - NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H300S/H500S/H700S/H300E/H500E/H700E/H410S
    - NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H410C
    - NetApp SolidFire & HCI Management Node
- NetApp states that there is no plan to address this vulnerability in the listed affected products.
