- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CODESYS Git component lacks proper server certificate validation when using the HTTPS protocol. Specifically, it does not verify if the server provides a valid and trusted HTTPS certificate.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295). The application does not validate the server's certificate during the TLS handshake.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack. This could allow the attacker to intercept and potentially modify communications between the CODESYS Git client and the server.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network. An attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the CODESYS Git client and the server (man-in-the-middle).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs high technical skills and the ability to intercept network communication. They do not need to be authenticated.
