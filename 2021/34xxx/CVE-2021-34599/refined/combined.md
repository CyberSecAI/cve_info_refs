Advisory 2021-18

1  Affected Products

All versions of CODESYS Git prior V1.1.0.0 are affected by this vulnerability.

As CODESYS Git requires a CODESYS Development System version of V3.5.17.0 or newer, CODESYS
Development Systems before V3.5.17.0 are not concerned at all.

2  Vulnerability overview

2.1  Type

CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation [7]

2.2  Management Summary

CODESYS Git lacks server certificate validation using HTTPS protocol. Therefore, the server connection is
vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack.

2.3  References

CVE: CVE-2021-34599 [6]

CODESYS JIRA: GIT-529

2.4  Severity Rating

CODESYS GmbH has rated this vulnerability as high.

The CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.4 has been assigned. The CVSS vector string is
(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N). [8]

3  Vulnerability details

3.1  Detailed Description

The CODESYS Development System is an IEC 61131-3 programming tool for the industrial controller and
automation technology sector. CODESYS Git seamlessly integrates the use of the distributed version control
system Git™ into the CODESYS Development System.

Affected versions of CODESYS Git lack certificate validation in HTTPS handshakes. CODESYS Git does not
implement certificate validation by default, so it does not verify that the server provides a valid and trusted
HTTPS certificate. Since the certificate of the server to which the connection is made is not properly verified, the
server connection is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack.

3.2  Exploitability

This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.

3.3  Difficulty

An attacker with high skills would be able to exploit this vulnerability.

3.4  Existence of exploit

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.

As part of a security strategy, CODESYS GmbH recommends the following general defense measures to
reduce the risk of exploits:
• Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that
they are not accessible from outside
• Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks
• Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required
• Activate and apply user management and password features
• Use encrypted communication links
• Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.
• Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions
For more information and general recommendations for protecting machines and plants, see also the
CODESYS Security Whitepaper [1].
