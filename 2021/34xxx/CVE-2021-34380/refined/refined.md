- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A potential heap overflow in NVIDIA MB2 (bootloader) leads to corruption of heap metadata.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap overflow, which can corrupt heap metadata.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, and information disclosure during secure boot.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local access to the device. The attack has a high complexity, and does not require user interaction.
