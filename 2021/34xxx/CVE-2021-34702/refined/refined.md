Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-34702:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper enforcement of administrator privilege levels within the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE). Specifically, it involves low-value sensitive data being accessible to users with insufficient privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authorization:** Read-only administrators are granted access to sensitive information that they should not have access to. This violates the principle of least privilege.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information about the system's configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:**  An attacker can gather sensitive configuration data from the Cisco ISE system.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:**  The disclosed information could be leveraged to facilitate other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely through the web-based management interface.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have valid read-only administrator credentials to access the vulnerable page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the web-based management interface of the Cisco ISE system.
*   **Valid Credentials:**  The attacker needs valid read-only administrator credentials for the Cisco ISE system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Cisco has assigned a CVSS base score of 4.3 (Medium) to this vulnerability with a vector of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N`.
*   The vulnerability is identified as CWE-200 (Information Exposure).
*   There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability in ISE versions 2.6, 2.7 and 3.0. ISE 3.1 is not vulnerable.
*   The Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public exploits of this vulnerability.
*  The vulnerability was reported by security researcher Nishant Raman.
