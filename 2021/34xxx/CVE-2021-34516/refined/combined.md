| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 8.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Windows |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the cdd.dll driver.
