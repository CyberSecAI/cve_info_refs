Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-34364:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper handling of links within documents by the Refined GitHub browser extension. This allows a malicious actor to craft a link that, when processed by the extension, injects arbitrary HTML into the webpage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting):** The primary weakness is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The Refined GitHub extension fails to properly sanitize or escape user-provided data (specifically links), leading to the injection of malicious HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary HTML Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML into pages viewed through the Refined GitHub extension. 
- While the vulnerability is mitigated by GitHub's strict Content Security Policy (CSP), a successful exploit could potentially lead to:
  - **UI Manipulation:** Altering the appearance of the page to deceive users.
  - **Data Theft:** If the CSP is bypassed or not fully effective, malicious scripts could be injected to steal sensitive data, such as session cookies or user input.
  - **Account Takeover:** If an attacker could bypass the CSP, they could potentially gain control of a user's GitHub account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Links:** The primary attack vector is through crafted malicious links embedded in documents or comments processed by the Refined GitHub extension.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create/Control Links:** The attacker needs to be able to create or control the content of links that are processed by the Refined GitHub extension (e.g., in comments, markdown documents, etc.)
- **Targeted User:** The victim must have the vulnerable version of the Refined GitHub extension installed and be viewing a page containing the malicious link.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 21.6.8 of Refined GitHub.
- GitHub's strict Content Security Policy (CSP) is mentioned as a mitigation.
- The vendor information is "Refined GitHub Maintainers".
