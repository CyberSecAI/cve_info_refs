Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-34900:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when opening a maliciously crafted J2K file in MicroStation or MicroStation-based applications. Specifically, the issue lies within the parsing of J2K files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read or write vulnerability.
- Use-after-free vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves opening a specially crafted J2K file using an affected version of MicroStation or a MicroStation-based application.
- The malicious J2K file needs to contain specifically crafted data to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to craft a malicious J2K file.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious J2K file using vulnerable software.
- No special privileges are required as the code execution happens in the context of the user.
