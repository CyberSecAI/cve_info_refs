Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2021-34785:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from improper authorization checks within the web-based management interface of Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot Application Software. Specifically, operations within the application lack proper authorization validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authorization:** The system does not adequately verify if the user has the necessary permissions to perform certain actions, which allows an attacker with read-only system administrator privileges to perform actions that require higher privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation (CVE-2021-34785):** An attacker with read-only system administrator access can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted requests. This could allow them to modify an existing system administrator account and take on the privileges of the targeted account, achieving privilege escalation.
- **Account Deletion (CVE-2021-34786):** An attacker with read-only system administrator privileges could exploit the vulnerability to delete an arbitrary user account from the affected application, also by sending crafted requests.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities remotely via the web-based management interface.
- **Crafted Requests:** The attacker must send crafted requests to the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with read-only system administrator privileges to exploit these vulnerabilities.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to reach the web-based management interface of the Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot Application Software.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerabilities are not dependent on each other; one can be exploited without exploiting the other.
- A software release that is affected by one vulnerability may not be affected by the other.
- There are no workarounds to these vulnerabilities, which means that software updates are needed to address them.
