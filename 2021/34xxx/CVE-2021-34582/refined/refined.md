- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The file upload functionality in the web-based management of Phoenix Contact FL MGUARD 1102 and 1105 devices does not properly neutralize input during web page generation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An attacker with Admin or Super Admin privileges can upload a malicious certificate file containing HTML code.
    - When a user views the affected web page (Basic settings > LDAP or Logs > Remote logging), the embedded HTML code is executed.
    - An attacker can read/modify settings only accessible to users with Super Admin role, such as user settings and LDAP settings, by embedding a crafted file into the Logs > Remote logging page and tricking a Super Admin to view the page.
    - An attacker can modify settings as another user, misrepresenting the identity of the user who made the changes, by embedding a crafted file into the Basic settings > LDAP or Logs > Remote logging page. This requires tricking the other user to view the page.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Uploading a malicious certificate file via the web-based management interface or the REST API.
    - The vulnerable pages are: Basic settings > LDAP or Logs > Remote logging.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with Admin or Super Admin role.
    - The attacker needs to trick another user into viewing the page where the malicious certificate was uploaded to execute the injected code.
