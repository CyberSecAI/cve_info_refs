- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper privilege management in the Apache web server configuration within FL MGUARD DM. The Apache web server, installed as part of FL MGUARD DM, does not require login credentials for access, even if configured during installation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Improper privilege management (CWE-269)
    - Unauthenticated access to the Apache web server
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers with network access can download and read mGuard configuration profiles ("ATV profiles"). These profiles may contain sensitive information such as private keys for IPsec VPN connections.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the Apache web server running as part of the FL MGUARD DM.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the affected device's Apache web server. No prior authentication is needed.
