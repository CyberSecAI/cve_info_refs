  "CVE-2021-34150": {
    "Description": "The Bluetooth Classic implementation on Bluetrum AB5301A (tested with AB32VG1 dev. kit) with unspecified firmware versions does not properly handle the reception of oversized DM1 LMP packets. This allows attackers in radio range to prevent new BT connections (disabling the AB5301A inquiry and page scan procedures) via a crafted LMP packet.",
    "Root cause": "Lack of proper handling of oversized DM1 LMP packets.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The device's Bluetooth stack does not validate the length of LMP packets received over the DM1 channel.",
      "The vulnerability lies in how the Bluetooth Link Manager Protocol (LMP) implementation handles oversized packets on the DM1 channel."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can prevent new Bluetooth connections to the target device, effectively disabling its ability to connect to other devices.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending an oversized LMP packet via DM1 channel.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs to be within radio range of the vulnerable device and be capable of sending crafted LMP packets."
