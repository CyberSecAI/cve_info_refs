- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data in the `DownloadCenterUploadHandler` class, allowing the upload of arbitrary files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file upload vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of NETWORK SERVICE, leading to a complete compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. An attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable component.
