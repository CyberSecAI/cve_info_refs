# **Etherpad** is a highly customizable **open source** online **editor** providing collaborative editing in really **real-time**.

![Show the editor and how fast you can collaborate with other people online.](/_next/static/media/etherpad_demo.9bd22127.gif)[290 Plugins](/plugins)105 LanguagesThousands of InstancesMillions of users
## Collaborating in really real-time

##### No more sending your stuff back and forth via email, just set up a pad, share the link and start collaborating!

Etherpad allows you to edit documents collaboratively in real-time, much like a live multi-player editor that runs in your browser. Write articles, press releases, to-do lists, etc. together with your friends, fellow students or colleagues, all working on the same document at the same time.

All instances provide access to all data through a well-documented API and support import/export to many major data exchange formats. And if the built-in feature set isn't enough for you, there's tons of plugins that allow you to customize your instance to suit your needs.

You don't need to set up a server and install Etherpad in order to use it. Just [pick](#links) one of the publicly available instances that friendly people from everywhere around the world have set up. Alternatively, you can set up your own instance by following our [installation guide](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite#installation).

## Add Functionalities

Etherpad is very customizable through plugins. Instructions can be found in the [plugin wiki article](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/wiki/Available-Plugins)

![Linus Torvalds and Edward Snowden winking into the camera from a collaborate Etherpad. The document reads 'So many plugins can be added to the original instance](/_next/static/media/etherpad_full_features.2ca09583.png)

## Customize Appearance

![A video showing the possibility to customize the appearance of Etherpad. You can switch between dark, light, super light and super dark.](/_next/static/media/etherpad_skin_variants.c6e42124.gif)
## Download Version 2.2.7

## Contribute

Etherpad is an open source project. Lots of passionate, helpful individuals have joined and voluntarily contributed every single bit throughout this project: From this website through the documentation to the very core of the application. So, if you like Etherpad and would like to give back some love, we'd like to see *your* contributions! It doesn't matter how familiar you are with real-time applications, or whether you know how to write programs for Node.js. There are plenty of ways to be helpful!

One of the first things you should do is actually use Etherpad, and get to know it - read about it, evangelise it, and engage with the wider community. You can also translate the user interface to your mother tongue or learn how to write plugins. Be creative!

If you'd like to help, [get in touch](#contact)! Also, [the wiki](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/wiki) is always a valuable resource.

##### Development workflow

The main development happens on [GitHub](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite). To contribute, [fork](https://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the [main repo](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite), branch off a [feature branch](https://www.google.com/search?q=git+feature+branches) from `develop`, make your changes and [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) them, [push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) to your fork and submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/) for `ether/develop`.

Once in a while we merge `develop` into `master`, which results in a new release. This means you will always find the latest stable version in the `master` branch.

# 1.8.14

### Security fixes

* Fixed a persistent XSS vulnerability in the Chat component. In case you can't update to 1.8.14 directly, we strongly recommend to cherry-pick [a796811](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/commit/a7968115581e20ef47a533e030f59f830486bdfa). Thanks to sonarsource for the professional disclosure.

### Compatibility changes

* Node.js v12.13.0 or later is now required.
* The `favicon` setting is now interpreted as a pathname to a favicon file, not a URL. Please see the documentation comment in `settings.json.template`.
* The undocumented `faviconPad` and `faviconTimeslider` settings have been removed.
* MySQL/MariaDB now uses connection pooling, which means you will see up to 10 connections to the MySQL/MariaDB server (by default) instead of 1. This might cause Etherpad to crash with a "ER\_CON\_COUNT\_ERROR: Too many connections" error if your server is configured with a low connection limit.
* Changes to environment variable substitution in `settings.json` (see the documentation comments in `settings.json.template` for details):
* An environment variable set to the string "null" now becomes `null` instead of the string "null". Similarly, if the environment variable is unset and the default value is "null" (e.g., `"${UNSET_VAR:null}"`), the value now becomes `null` instead of the string "null". It is no longer possible to produce the string "null" via environment variable substitution.
* An environment variable set to the string "undefined" now causes the setting to be removed instead of set to the string "undefined". Similarly, if the environment variable is unset and the default value is "undefined" (e.g., `"${UNSET_VAR:undefined}"`), the setting is now removed instead of set to the string "undefined". It is no longer possible to produce the string "undefined" via environment variable substitution.
* Support for unset variables without a default value is now deprecated. Please change all instances of `"${FOO}"` in your `settings.json` to `${FOO:null}` to keep the current behavior.
* The `DB_*` variable substitutions in `settings.json.docker` that previously defaulted to `null` now default to "undefined".
* Calling `next` without argument when using `Changeset.opIterator` does always return a new Op. See [b9753dc](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/commit/b9753dcc7156d8471a5aa5b6c9b85af47f630aa8) for details.

### Notable enhancements and fixes

* MySQL/MariaDB now uses connection pooling, which should improve stability and reduce latency.
* Bulk database writes are now retried individually on write failure.
* Minify: Avoid crash due to unhandled Promise rejection if stat fails.
* padIds are now included in /socket.io query string, e.g. `https://video.etherpad.com/socket.io/?padId=AWESOME&EIO=3&transport=websocket&t=...&sid=...`. This is useful for directing pads to separate socket.io nodes.
* <script> elements added via aceInitInnerdocbodyHead hook are now executed.
* Fix read only pad access with authentication.
* Await more db writes.
* Disabled wtfnode dump by default.
* Send `USER_NEWINFO` messages on reconnect.
* Fixed loading in a hidden iframe.
* Fixed a race condition with composition. (Thanks [@ingoncalves](https://github.com/ingoncalves) for an exceptionally detailed analysis and [@rhansen](https://github.com/rhansen) for the fix.)

Etherpad is one of the most popular online text editors that allows collaborating on documents in real-time. It is customizable with more than 250 plugins available and features a version history as well as a chat functionality. There are thousands of instances deployed worldwide with millions of users. The project is very popular within the open-source community as shown by the over 10,000 stars on GitHub. Etherpad instances are often publicly usable and can contain sensitive information.

As part of our security research on open source projects we analyzed Etherpad's code and found two critical vulnerabilities. Both can be combined by an attacker to completely take over an Etherpad instance and its data. In this blog post, we cover the technical details of these code vulnerabilities, show how they were patched, and give advice on how to avoid these types of bugs during development.

## Impact

Two injection vulnerabilities were found in Etherpad 1.8.13 that have been present since at least version 1.7.0:

* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): CVE-2021-34817
* Argument Injection: CVE-2021-34816

The XSS vulnerability allows attackers to take over Etherpad users, including admins. This can be used to steal or manipulate sensitive data. The Argument Injection vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, which would allow them to steal, modify or delete all data, or to target other internal systems that are reachable from the server.

Exploiting the XSS vulnerability is possible on any Etherpad instance with a default configuration. The Argument Injection vulnerability requires an admin account to exist, which is not a default setting. Both vulnerabilities can be combined by an attacker to first compromise an admin and then to use these privileges to execute arbitrary code on the server.

A fix for the XSS vulnerability is implemented in Etherpad version 1.8.14. The Argument Injection vulnerability is still unpatched, but it is significantly harder to exploit on its own.

Here is a short demonstration of exploiting both vulnerabilities to get a shell on the server:

Etherpad 1.8.13 - Remote Code Execution

## Technical Details

In the following technical analysis, we analyze the root cause of the two code vulnerabilities. We first take a look at the XSS vulnerability, then we explain the Argument Injection vulnerability.

### Persistent XSS in Chat Messages (CVE-2021-34817)

To allow for better collaboration in a pad, Etherpad offers a chat feature. Here, users can exchange messages in a per-pad group chat. The messages are stored on the server, making the chat history available to everyone.

When a user opens a pad, the chat messages are rendered in the frontend, which involves creating HTML elements from that data. During rendering, the `userId` property of a chat message is inserted into the DOM without properly escaping special characters:

[**src/static/js/chat.js**](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/blob/996a2d86ddea37c27b9ae11aa87c7fd6f8941b97/src/static/js/chat.js#L173-L177 "src/static/js/chat.js")

```
173    const html =
174        `<p data-authorId='${msg.userId}' …> …` +
175        `<span …`;
176    if (isHistoryAdd) $(html).insertAfter('#chatloadmessagesbutton');
177    else $('#chattext').append(html);
```

In line 174 the `userId` value is used to build a string of HTML markup and in lines 176 and 177 this string is inserted into the DOM. If attackers manage to control a chatter's user ID, then they would be able to insert an XSS payload and perform actions as a victim user. So how can an attacker control a user ID?

Etherpad also features an export/import functionality that handles multiple formats, including a custom JSON-based one. Files in this format can contain a pad's content, its revision history, and all associated chat messages. Such a file can then be used to create a copy of a pad by importing it. An exemplary export file looks like the following:

**example.etherpad**

```
{
    "pad:1": {
        "chatHead": 0
    },
    "pad:1:chat:0": {
        "text": "Hello World!",
        "userId": "aE45C6209"
    }
}
```

Certain values are validated during the import, but the user IDs of chat messages are used as-is. Since the import feature is enabled by default, an attacker can use this to create a pad that has a chat message with a user ID that consists of arbitrary data.

When that data contains HTML markup, then this markup will be inserted into the DOM, which will execute any inline JavaScript code. As a result, an attacker is able to inject malicious JavaScript code into the chat history which is then executed in an administrator's browser when accessing a pad. This enables an attacker to initiate further attack requests in the browser context of the admin.

### Argument Injection in Plugin Management (CVE-2021-34816)

Etherpad also features an admin area that can be used by users that are configured to have the admin role. It allows them to manage plugins, edit settings, and view system information.

When an admin installs a plugin, a message with the name of the plugin is sent to the backend through a WebSocket connection. The backend then installs the NPM package that corresponds to that name:

[**src/static/js/pluginfw/installer.js**](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/blob/996a2d86ddea37c27b9ae11aa87c7fd6f8941b97/src/static/js/pluginfw/installer.js#L49-L66 "src/static/js/pluginfw/installer.js")

```
49    exports.install = async (pluginName, cb = null) => {
 …      // ...
52      try {
 …        // ...
56        await runCmd(['npm', 'install', /* ... */ pluginName]);
57      } catch (err) {
 …        // ...
61      }
 …      // ...
66    };
```

In line 56, the plugin name is used as an argument for an `npm install` system command without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to specify a malicious package from the NPM repository or to simply use a URL that points to a package on the attacker's server.

The attacker can either craft a plugin that hooks into Etherpad internals, e.g. creating a backdoor API endpoint, or just use a package with a post-install script which will be executed right after the installation of the package. As a result, the attacker can execute arbitrary code and system commands to fully compromise the Etherpad instance and its data.

To summarize, both vulnerabilities can be chained together in order to first take over an admin's client using the XSS and then gaining access to the server by installing an attacker-controlled plugin.

### Patch

In order to mitigate the XSS vulnerability, all values including the userId property should be properly escaped before inserting them into the DOM. This approach was taken by the Etherpad team:

[**src/static/js/chat.js**](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/blob/a7968115581e20ef47a533e030f59f830486bdfa/src/static/js/chat.js#L132 "src/static/js/chat.js")

```
msg.userId = padutils.escapeHtml(msg.userId);
```

Fixing the Argument Injection is more complex because there is no vetted list of trusted plugins. A first step would be to limit plugin names to valid NPM package names. This prevents the use of URLs and has the benefit that now only packages from the official NPM repository can be installed. However, this is still not a complete fix, because attackers could publish malicious NPM packages.

The optimal solution would be to have a list of trusted plugins and then check a plugin's name against this allowlist before installing it. This is not practical here, as Etherpad is a community project and anybody can contribute plugins.

The Argument Injection vulnerability has not been fixed yet, because it is not really possible as we just saw. However, it is far less likely to be exploited on its own, so fixing the XSS vulnerability also reduced the risk of the Argument Injection. To completely mitigate exploitation, we recommend disabling all admin users and do configuration or plugin management via command-line access.

### Timeline

| **Date** | **Action** |
| --- | --- |
| 2021-04-06 | We report a detailed advisory via email |
| 2021-04-06 | Vulnerabilities are confirmed by the vendor |
| 2021-04-08 | Vendor fixes the XSS vulnerability |
| 2021-07-04 | Vendor releases version 1.8.14 that includes the fix |

### Summary

In this blog post, we analyzed two code vulnerabilities in Etherpad 1.8.13. The combination of the vulnerabilities can lead to a full compromise of an Etherpad installation. We looked at the vulnerable code snippets and explained how an attacker can exploit them. We also showed how important data validation and sanitization are for avoiding such flaws during development. As we have shown, the smallest coding mistake can be the first stepping stone for an attacker to launch further attacks against the software.

If you are hosting an Etherpad instance and have not updated your installation to version 1.8.14 yet, then we highly recommend that you do so now. Finally, we would like to thank the Etherpad team for their fast response to our initial advisory and their quick fix of the XSS vulnerability.
