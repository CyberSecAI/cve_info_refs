Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-34377:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists within the HDCP service Trusted Application (TA) in the Trusty OS.
- The root cause is a missing bounds check in command 9 of the HDCP service TA.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer:** The lack of bounds checking on input to command 9 allows for out-of-bounds memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of privileges:** The vulnerability may allow an attacker to gain higher privileges.
- **Information disclosure:** It could lead to leaking sensitive data from the system memory.
- **Denial of service:** The vulnerability may cause the system to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **Trusted Application:** The vulnerability is triggered within the HDCP service TA, likely via a malicious client application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a privileged position to interact with the HDCP service TA.
- User interaction is required for exploitation.

**Summary**

CVE-2021-34377 describes a vulnerability in the HDCP service TA of the Trusty OS used by NVIDIA Jetson devices. The lack of bounds checking in command 9 could allow a local attacker with sufficient privileges to cause a variety of problems, including privilege escalation, data leaks and denial of service.
