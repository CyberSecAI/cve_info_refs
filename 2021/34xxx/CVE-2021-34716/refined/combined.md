Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product. [Learn more](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/social-justice/inclusive-language-policy.html) about how Cisco is using Inclusive Language.

## Security Basics

* [Data at Rest](#concept_9FB64D1DBB0784BC0B75E80EB3D0FA6D)
* [TLS and Certificates](#concept_807A470BE544BFB881B101BC7538BCC9)

### Data at Rest

Every software installation (from X8.11) has a unique root of trust. Each Expressway system has a unique key that is used
to encrypt data local to that system. This improves the security of data at rest in the following ways:

* The new key is created when you upgrade a pre-X8.11 version to X8.11 or later, and is used to encrypt all data on the first
  restart.
* Only this key can be used to decrypt data from this system. No other Expressway key can decrypt this system's data.
* The key is never exposed on the UI, and it is never logged--locally or remotely.

### TLS and Certificates

For TLS encryption to work successfully in a connection between a client and server:

* The server must have a certificate installed that verifies its identity, which is signed by a Certificate Authority (CA).
* The client must trust the CA that signed the certificate used by the server.

Expressway lets you install a certificate that can represent the Expressway as either a client or a server in TLS connections.
Expressway can also authenticate client connections (typically from a web browser) over HTTPS. You can upload certificate
revocation lists (CRLs) for the CAs used to verify LDAP server and HTTPS client certificates. Expressway can generate server
certificate signing requests (CSRs), so there is no need to use an external mechanism to do this.

| **Note** | ---   For all secure communications (HTTPS and SIP/TLS), we recommend that you replace the Expressway default certificate with a certificate generated by a trusted CA.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Table 1. Expressway Role in Different Connection Types

| In connections... | The Expressway acts as... |
| --- | --- |
| To an endpoint. | TLS server. |
| To an LDAP server. | Client. |
| Between two Expressway systems. | Either Expressway may be the client. The other Expressway is the TLS server. |
| Over HTTPS. | Web browser is the client. Expressway is the server. |

| **Note** | ---   We also recommend using a third-party LDAP browser to verify that your LDAP server is correctly configured for TLS.   --- |
| --- | --- |

TLS can be difficult to configure. So if using it with an LDAP server, for example, we recommend verifying that the system
works correctly over TCP, before you attempt to secure the connection with TLS.

| **Caution** | ---   Certificates must be RFC-compliant. Do not allow CA certificates or CRLs to expire, as this may cause certificates signed by those CAs to be rejected.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Certificate and CRL files are managed via the web interface, and cannot be installed using the CLI.

## Configuring Certificate-Based Authentication

The **Certificate-based authentication configuration** page (Maintenance >
 Security >
 Certificate-based authentication configuration) is used to configure how the Expressway retrieves authorization credentials (the username) from a client browser's certificate.

This configuration is required if **Client certificate-based security** (defined on the [System](exwy_m_network-and-system-settings.html#reference_66E773DDE58E7DB564000035558A0A05) page) is set to *Certificate-based authentication*. This setting means that the standard login mechanism is no longer available and that administrators (and FindMe accounts,
if accessed via the Expressway) can log in only if they present a valid browser certificate - typically provided via a smart
card (also referred to as a Common Access Card or CAC) - and the certificate contains appropriate credentials that have a
suitable authorization level.

* [Authentication Versus Authorization](#reference_F4A4DE9F12D79FDBEF7799893B8A0C1B)
* [Obtaining the Username from the Certificate](#reference_F871B1502259D4E591292F219EF47883)
* [Emergency Account and Certificate-Based Authentication](#reference_B071610B3E8B848BC5A7D21074D69545)

### Enabling Certificate-Based Authentication

The recommended procedure for enabling certificate-based authentication is described below:
#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Add the Expressway's trusted CA and server certificate files (on the **Trusted CA certificate** and **Server certificate** pages, respectively). |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Configure certificate revocation lists (on the **CRL management** page). |
| **Step 3** | Use the **Client certificate testing** page to verify that the client certificate you intend to use is valid. |
| **Step 4** | Set **Client certificate-based security** to *Certificate validation* (on the **System administration** page). |
| **Step 5** | Restart the Expressway. |
| **Step 6** | Use the **Client certificate testing** page again to set up the required regex and format patterns to extract the username credentials from the certificate. |
| **Step 7** | Only when you are sure that the correct username is being extracted from the certificate, set **Client certificate-based security** to *Certificate-based authentication*. |

---

### Authentication Versus Authorization

When the Expressway is operating in certificate-based authentication mode, user authentication is managed by a process external
to the Expressway.

When a user attempts to log in to the Expressway, the Expressway will request a certificate from the client browser. The browser
may then interact with a card reader to obtain the certificate from the smart card (or alternatively the certificate may already
be loaded into the browser). To release the certificate from the card/browser, the user will typically be requested to authenticate
themselves by entering a PIN. If the client certificate received by the Expressway is valid (signed by a trusted certificate
authority, in date and not revoked by a CRL) then the user is deemed to be authenticated.

To determine the user's authorization level (read-write, read-only and so on) the Expressway must extract the user's authorization
username from the certificate and present it to the relevant local or remote authorization mechanism.

| **Note** | ---   If the client certificate is not protected (by a PIN or some other mechanism) then unauthenticated access to the Expressway may be possible. This lack of protection may also apply if the certificates are stored in the browser, although some browsers do allow you to password protect their certificate store.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Obtaining the Username from the Certificate

The username is extracted from the client browser's certificate according to the patterns defined in the Regex and Username format fields on the **Certificate-based authentication configuration** page:

* In the Regex field, use the (?<name>regex ) syntax to supply names for capture groups so that matching sub-patterns can be substituted in the associated Username format field, for example,

  /(Subject:.\*, CN=(?<Group1>.\*))/m.

  The regex defined here must conform to [PHP regex guidelines](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pcre.php).
* The Username format field can contain a mixture of fixed text and the capture group names used in the **Regex**. Delimit each capture group name with # , for example, prefix#Group1#suffix . Each capture group name will be replaced with the text obtained from the regular expression processing.

You can use the [Client certificate testing](#reference_46DC3F5D62B2F0D307EF3ECA524C7797) page to test the outcome of applying different **Regex** and **Username format** combinations to a certificate.

### Emergency Account and Certificate-Based Authentication

Advanced account security mode requires that you use only remote authentication, but also mandates that you have an emergency
account in case the authentication server is unavailable. See [Configuring Advanced Account Security Mode](#reference_C0FAB0B806FC653F8F43CCAD8AC88F87).

If you are using certificate-based authentication, the emergency account must be able to authenticate by presenting a valid
certificate with matching credentials.

You should create a client certificate for the emergency account, make sure that the CN matches the **Username format**, and load the certificate into the emergency administrator's certificate store.

## Managing the Trusted CA Certificate List

Trusted CA certificate) allows you to manage the list of certificates for the Certificate Authorities (CAs) trusted by this Expressway. When a TLS
connection to Expressway mandates certificate verification, the certificate presented to the Expressway must be signed by
a trusted CA in this list and there must be a full chain of trust (intermediate CAs) to the root CA.

* To upload a new file containing one or more CA certificates, Browse to the required PEM file and click Append CA certificate. This will append any new certificates to the existing list of CA certificates. If you are replacing existing certificates
  for a particular issuer and subject, you have to manually delete the previous certificates.
* To replace all of the currently uploaded CA certificates with the system's original list of trusted CA certificates, click
  Reset to default CA certificate.
* To view the entire list of currently uploaded trusted CA certificates, click Show all (decoded) to view it in a human-readable form, or click Show all (PEM file) to view the file in its raw format.
* To view an individual trusted CA certificate, click on View (decoded) in the row for the specific CA certificate.
* To delete one or more CA certificates, tick the box(es) next to the relevant CA certificate(s) and click Delete.

| **Note** | ---   If you have enabled certificate revocation list (CRL) checking for TLS encrypted [connections to an LDAP server](exwy_m_user-accounts.html#concept_27EF4DB0C9EFA01BCB274A443E759CA3) (for account authentication), you must add the PEM encoded CRL data to your trusted CA certificate file.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Root CAs included by default

Expressway X12.6 and later includes these trusted root CAs, which are installed as part of the *Cisco Intersection CA Bundle*:

* O=Internet Security Research Group, CN=ISRG Root X1
* O=Digital Signature Trust Co., CN=DST Root CA X3

## Managing the Expressway Server Certificate

Use the **Server certificate** page (Maintenance >
Security >
Server certificate) to manage the Expressway server certificate, which identifies Expressway when it communicates with client systems using
TLS encryption and with web browsers over HTTPS.

You can view details of the currently loaded certificate, generate a CSR, upload a new certificate, and configure the ACME
service. These tasks are described in the Cisco Expressway Certificate Creation and Use Deployment Guide on the [Expressway Configuration Guides](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/unified-communications/expressway-series/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html) page.

| **Note** | ---   We strongly recommend using certificates based on RSA keys.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Other types of certificate, such as those based on DSA keys, are not tested and may not work with Expressway in all scenarios.

* [Using the ACME Service](#reference_A6F350FB7D29A6B410F482B78435933F)
* [Server Certificates and Clustered Systems](#reference_FABA1139C375656E070C0DF5CB307B48)
* [Server Certificates and Unified Communications](#reference_30269151DBD5081BFD4332B0D6E69B10)

### Using the ACME Service

From X12.5 the Cisco Expressway Series supports the ACME protocol (Automated Certificate Management Environment) which enables
automatic certificate signing and deployment to the Expressway-E from a certificate authority such as Let's Encrypt.

### Server Certificates and Clustered Systems

When a CSR is generated, a single request and private key combination is generated for that peer only. If you have a cluster
of Expressways, you must generate a separate signing request on each peer. Those requests must then be sent to the certificate
authority and the returned server certificates uploaded to each relevant peer.

Make sure that the correct server certificate is uploaded to the appropriate peer, otherwise the stored private key on each
peer will not correspond to the uploaded certificate.

### Server Certificates and Unified Communications

If you deploy Mobile and Remote Access, details about the Unified Communication and Expressway certificate requirements are
in the Cisco Expressway Certificate Creation and Use Deployment Guide on the [Expressway Configuration Guides](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/unified-communications/expressway-series/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html) page.

## Managing Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)

Certificate revocation list files (CRLs) are used by the Expressway to validate certificates presented by client browsers
and external systems that communicate with the Expressway over TLS/HTTPS. A CRL identifies those certificates that have been
revoked and can no longer be used to communicate with the Expressway.

We recommend that you upload CRL data for the CAs that sign TLS/HTTPS client and server certificates. When enabled, CRL checking
is applied for every CA in the chain of trust.

* [Certificate Revocation Sources](#reference_4B74492BC1F3B78D55FD85358435CF71)
* [Configuring Revocation Checking for SIP TLS Connections](#reference_8F720E15819D44B23E90B764D94BC666)

### Certificate Revocation Sources

The Expressway can obtain certificate revocation information from multiple sources:

* Automatic downloads of CRL data from CRL distribution points.
* Through OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) responder URIs in the certificate to be checked (SIP TLS only).
* Manual upload of CRL data.
* CRL data embedded within the Expressway's **Trusted CA certificate** file.

* [Limitations and Usage Guidelines](#concept_5725E8DA9BD3A7F24B5ECA7C7A74A3B2)
* [Automatic CRL Updates](#task_8EEAF4A4E58F5FD9EDBA0F39B8D283B4)
* [Manual CRL Updates](#task_2FAB1023AAC608688250DAAE0542228A)
* [Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)](#concept_BDC4581888A5778B12B15A951DFD00C8)

#### Limitations and Usage Guidelines

The following limitations and usage guidelines apply:

* When establishing SIP TLS connections, the CRL data sources are subject to the **Certificate revocation checking** settings on the **SIP**  configuration page.
* Automatically downloaded CRL files override any manually loaded CRL files (except for when verifying SIP TLS connections,
  when both manually uploaded or automatically downloaded CRL data may be used).
* When validating certificates presented by external policy servers, the Expressway uses manually loaded CRLs only.
* When validating TLS connections with an LDAP server for remote login account authentication, the Expressway only uses CRL
  data that has been embedded into the **Trusted CA certificate** (Tools >
  Security >
  Trusted CA certificate).

  For LDAP connections, Expressway does not download the CRL from Certificate Distribution Point URLs in the server or issuing
  CA certificates. Also, it does not use the manual or automatic update settings on the **CRL management** page.

#### Automatic CRL Updates

| **Note** | ---   We recommend that you configure the Expressway to perform automatic CRL updates. This ensures that the latest CRLs are available for certificate validation.   --- |
| --- | --- |

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to Maintenance >  Security >  CRL management. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Set **Automatic CRL updates** to *Enabled*. |
| **Step 3** | Enter the set of **HTTP(S) distribution points** from where the Expressway can obtain CRL files.   | **Note** | * You must specify each distribution point on a new line * Only HTTP(S) distribution points are supported; if HTTPS is used, the distribution point server itself must have a valid certificate * PEM and DER encoded CRL files are supported * The distribution point may point directly to a CRL file or to ZIP and GZIP archives containing multiple CRL files * The file extensions in the URL or on any files unpacked from a downloaded archive do not matter as the Expressway will determine   the underlying file type for itself; however, typical URLs could be in the format:    + <http://example.com/crl.pem>   + <http://example.com/crl.der>   + <http://example.com/ca.crl>   + <https://example.com/allcrls.zip>   + <https://example.com/allcrls.gz> | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | Enter the `Daily update time` (in UTC). This is the approximate time of day when the Expressway will attempt to update its CRLs from the distribution points. |
| **Step 5** | Click Save. |

---

#### Manual CRL Updates

You can upload CRL files manually to the Expressway. Certificates presented by external policy servers can only be validated
against manually loaded CRLs.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to Maintenance >  Security >  CRL management. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Browse and select the required file from your file system. It must be in PEM encoded format. |
| **Step 3** | Click Upload CRL file.  This uploads the selected file and replaces any previously uploaded CRL file.  Click Remove revocation list if you want to remove the manually uploaded file from the Expressway.  If a certificate authority's CRL expires, all certificates issued by that CA will be treated as revoked. |

---

#### Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)

The Expressway can establish a connection with an OCSP responder to query the status of a particular certificate.The Expressway
determines the OCSP responder to use from the responder URI listed in the certificate being verified. The OCSP responder sends
a status of "good", "revoked" or "unknown" for the certificate.

The benefit of OCSP is that there is no need to download an entire revocation list. OCSP is supported for SIP TLS connections
only. See below for information on how to enable OCSP.

Outbound communication from the Expressway-E is required for the connection to the OCSP responder. Check the port number of
the OCSP responder you are using (typically this is port 80 or 443) and ensure that outbound communication is allowed to that
port from the Expressway-E.

### Configuring Revocation Checking for SIP TLS Connections

You must also configure how certificate revocation checking is managed for SIP TLS connections.

1. Go to Configuration >
   SIP.
2. Scroll down to the **Certificate revocation checking** section and configure the settings accordingly:

   | Field | Description | Usage Tips |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Certificate revocation checking mode | Controls whether revocation checking is performed for certificates exchanged during SIP TLS connection establishment. | We recommend that revocation checking is enabled. |
   | Use OCSP | Controls whether the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) may be used to perform certificate revocation checking. | To use OCSP:  * The X.509 certificate to be checked must contain an OCSP responder URI. * The OCSP responder must support the SHA-256 hash algorithm. If it is not supported, the OCSP revocation check and the certificate   validation will fail. |
   | Use CRLs | Controls whether Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) are used to perform certificate revocation checking. | CRLs can be used if the certificate does not support OCSP.  CRLs can be loaded manually onto the Expressway, downloaded automatically from preconfigured URIs (see [Managing Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)](#reference_EEA5DC103CF5C16B988B08860C1D19A0)), or downloaded automatically from a CRL distribution point (CDP) URI contained in the X.509 certificate. |
   | Allow CRL downloads from CDPs | Controls whether the download of CRLs from the CDP URIs contained in X.509 certificates is allowed. |  |
   | Fallback behavior | Controls the revocation checking behavior if the revocation status cannot be established, for example if the revocation source cannot be contacted.  *Treat as revoked*: Treat the certificate as revoked (and thus do not allow the TLS connection).  *Treat as not revoked*: Treat the certificate as not revoked.  Default: *Treat as not revoked* | *Treat as not revoked* ensures that your system continues to operate in a normal manner if the revocation source cannot be contacted, however it does potentially mean that revoked certificates will be accepted. |

## Managing mTLS Client Certificate Verification for MRA Onboarding

The **CA certificate page for mTLS** is accessed from the **Trusted CA certificate** page (Maintenance >
Security >
Trusted CA certificate). This page only applies if you use Expressway for Mobile and Remote Access (MRA) with Cisco Unified Communications products,
and onboarding with activation codes is enabled for MRA.

## Testing Client Certificates

The **Client certificate testing** page (Maintenance >
Security >
Client certificate testing) is used to check client certificates before enabling [client certificate validation](exwy_m_network-and-system-settings.html#reference_66E773DDE58E7DB564000035558A0A05). You can:

* Test whether a client certificate is valid when checked against the Expressway's current trusted CA list and, if loaded, the
  revocation list (see  [Managing Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)](#reference_EEA5DC103CF5C16B988B08860C1D19A0)).
* Test the outcome of applying the regex and template patterns that retrieve a certificate's authorization credentials (the
  username).

You can test against a certificate on your local file system or the browser's currently loaded certificate.

* [To test if a certificate is valid](#task_1C7C9A46F2D980F02B961B28AAA3E938)
* [To retrieve authorization credentials (username) from the certificate](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_27e91dff-5513-4a78-a205-3db41062c458)

### To test if a certificate is valid

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select the Certificate source. You can choose to:   * Upload a test file from your file system in either PEM or plain text format; if so click Browse to select the certificate file you want to test * Test against the certificate currently loaded into your browser (only available if the system is already configured to use   *Certificate validation* and a certificate is currently loaded) |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Ignore the **Certificate-based authentication pattern** section - this is only relevant if you are extracting authorization credentials from the certificate. |
| **Step 3** | Click Check certificate. The results of the test are shown in the **Certificate test results** section. |

---

### To retrieve authorization credentials (username) from the certificate

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select the Certificate source as described above. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Configure the Regex and Username format fields as required. Their purpose is to extract a username from the nominated certificate by supplying a regular expression that will look for an appropriate string pattern within the certificate. The fields default to the currently configured settings on the **Certificate-based authentication configuration** page but you can change them as required.   * In the Regex field, use the (?<name>regex ) syntax to supply names for capture groups so that matching sub patterns can be substituted in the associated Username format field, for example,  /(Subject:.\*, CN=(?<Group1>.\*))/m.  The regex defined here must conform to [PHP regex guidelines](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pcre.php). * The Username format field can contain a mixture of fixed text and the capture group names used in the **Regex**. Delimit each capture group name with # , for example, prefix#Group1#suffix . Each capture group name will be replaced with the text obtained from the regular expression processing. |
| **Step 3** | Click Check certificate. The results of the test are shown in the **Certificate test results** section. The **Resulting string** item is the username credential that would be checked against the relevant authorization mechanism to determine that user's authorization (account access) level. |
| **Step 4** | If necessary, you can modify the Regex and Username format fields and repeat the test until the correct results are produced.   | **Note** | If the **Certificate source** is an uploaded PEM or plain text file, the selected file is temporarily uploaded to the Expressway when the test is first performed:   * If you want to keep testing different **Regex** and **Username format** combinations against the same file, you do not have to reselect the file for every test. * If you change the contents of your test file on your file system, or you want to choose a different file, you must click Browse again and select the new or modified file to upload. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 5** | If you have changed the Regex and Username format fields from their default values and want to use these values in the Expressway's actual configuration (as specified on the **Certificate-based authentication configuration** page) then click Make these settings permanent.   | **Note** | * Any uploaded test file is automatically deleted from the Expressway at the end of your login session. * The regex is applied to a plain text version of an encoded certificate. The system uses the command openssl x509 -text -nameopt RFC2253 -noout to extract the plain text certificate from its encoded format. | | --- | --- | |

## Testing Secure Traversal

This utility tests whether a secure connection can be made from the Expressway-C to the Expressway-E. A secure connection
is required for a Unified Communications traversal zone, and is optional (recommended) for a normal traversal zone.

If the secure traversal test fails, the utility raises a warning with appropriate resolution where possible.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | On the Expressway-C, go to Maintenance >  Security >  Secure traversal test. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Enter the FQDN of the Expressway-E that is paired with this Expressway-C. |
| **Step 3** | Enter the TLS verify name of this Expressway-C, as it appears on the paired Expressway-E.  This setting is in the SIP section of the Expressway-E's traversal zone configuration page. |
| **Step 4** | Click Test connection.  The secure traversal test utility checks whether the hosts on either side of the traversal zone recognize each other and trust each others' certificate chains.   | **Note** | You must select the version of **HTTPS minimum TLS version** to test the applicability of a secure connection that enables the minimum supported TLS version by Expressway. Also, select the **HTTPS ciphers** for the same. This selection of *HTTPTLSversion* is required for connection establishment towards Unified Communication servers like VCSE, CUCM, CUP, and UCXN. These settings are configured on the  **Ciphers** page (Maintenance >  Security >  Ciphers). | | --- | --- | |

---

## Managing the Expressway Server Certificate with HSM

| **Important** | ---   HSM functionality support on Expressway may be a **Preview feature only**, depending on the Expressway software version. For example, it is a Preview feature in version X12.6. Please check the release notes for your Expressway version before you use HSM and if its status is Preview for your software version, **only enable HSM if you are willing to implement it as a Preview feature and subject to the Preview disclaimer contained in the Expressway Release Notes**. Instructions for how to configure and enable HSM are currently provided only in the Expressway Release Notes.   --- |
| --- | --- |

These instructions assume that HSM is already enabled on Expressway (Maintenance >
Security >
HSM configuration).

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to Maintenance >  Security >  Server certificate. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Generate CSR. You are navigated to the **Generate CSR** page.  The **Server certificate type** section displays at the top of the **Generate CSR** page. If HSM usage is not configured, the section does not display.  If you have an Expressway cluster, issues may arise if the CSR fields are incorrectly completed. For details on how to fill these fields, see the Cisco Expressway Cluster Creation and Maintenance Deployment Guide on the  [Cisco Expressway Series Configuration Guides](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/unified-communications/expressway-series/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html) page. |
| **Step 3** | After generating as HSM private key and CSR, you are returned to the **Server certificate** page. |
| **Step 4** | You can view and download the generated HSM CSR from the  **Certificate signing request (CSR)** section. |
| **Step 5** | Click Download to download the certificate. |
| **Step 6** | Sign the certificate using certificate signing authority. |

---

* [Install the HSM private key and certificate](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_03c5a91e-98bd-495c-b896-0e4edc1301f3)
* [Download the HSM key handle across a cluster](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_d8c2635c-dc07-42e8-8da7-41d293360536)
* [Restart Expressway](#Cisco_Concept.dita_0f2b7553-9722-44c0-b93d-cc86b41efeb6)

### Install the HSM private key and certificate

| **Note** | ---   Only use these instructions if you use Hardware Security Module (HSM) functionality.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | To upload a signed certificate, click Choose File to navigate to the location and choose the certificate. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Select a certificate file and corresponding certificate type, and click Upload server certificate data to upload the certificate.  For more information, see the section about managing the Expressway's server certificate. |

---

### Download the HSM key handle across a cluster

After deploying an HSM certificate and private key to an Expressway, the HSM certificate and private key can be deployed to
other Expressways in a cluster. To do this:

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | On the primary peer. Download the HSM private key from the first Expressway. After deploying an HSM certificate and private key, a Download HSM key handle button displays on the **Server certificate data** section. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | On the cluster peers. Upload the HSM private key with HSM certificate to other peers in the cluster from the **Upload new certificate** section. Browse to and select the signed HSM certificate and private key. |

---

### Restart Expressway

After an HSM certificate is installed on Expressway, a banner on the **Server certificate** page prompts you to restart Expressway. An alarm is also raised to restart. Although the certificate is now installed, the
restart is required for the Expressway to begin using it.

After the restart, the alarm disappears and all services on the Expressway use the new HSM certificate.

## Configuring Hardware Security Module Functionality

The **HSM configuration** page (Maintenance >
Security >
HSM configuration) is used to manage HSM devices with Expressway.

| **Important** | ---   HSM functionality may be a **Preview feature only**, depending on the Expressway software version. For example, it is a Preview feature in version X12.6. Please check the release notes for your Expressway version before you use HSM and if its status is Preview for your software version, only enable HSM if you are willing to implement it as a Preview feature. Instructions for how to configure HSM are currently provided only in the Expressway release notes and not in this section.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Configuring Minimum TLS Version and Cipher Suites

The Maintenance >
Security >
Ciphers page is used to manage the minimum TLS version for services on Expressway, and their associated cipher suites.

| **Note** | ---   For improved security, TLS version 1.2 or later is recommended for all encrypted sessions.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Expressway defaults to TLS 1.2 when establishing secure connections for the following:

* HTTPS
* Certificate checker
* Cisco Meeting Server discovery
* SIP
* XMPP
* UC server discovery
* Reverse proxy
* LDAP
* SMTP mail server
* TMS Provisioning Service

### Restart required in some cases

A restart is required after changing the cipher suite configuration or TLS protocol version for the following:

* SIP
* XCP

* [Minimum TLS Version](#reference_4DBB857A1F1924E36837753778780546)
* [Cipher Suites](#reference_E43B108612B0C8AD33C0185D5C95565D)

### Minimum TLS Version

On upgrade of an existing system, the previous behavior and defaults persist so you won't be defaulted to TLS 1.2.

For new installations, check that all browsers and other equipment that must connect to Expressway support TLS 1.2.

If required--typically for compatibility reasons with legacy equipment--the minimum TLS versions can be configured per service
to use versions 1.0 or 1.1.

### Cipher Suites

You can configure the cipher suite and minimum supported TLS version for services on the Expressway. The cipher suites are
shown in the table (cipher strings are in OpenSSL format):

For services where the Expressway can act as a client, such as HTTPS, the same minimum TLS version and cipher suites will
be negotiated.

| Services | Cipher Suite Values (Defaults) |
| --- | --- |
| HTTPS ciphers | EECDH:EDH:HIGH:-  AES256+SHA:!MEDIUM:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!PSK:!eNULL:!aNULL |
| Reverse proxy TLS ciphers | EECDH:EDH:HIGH:-  AES256+SHA:!MEDIUM:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!PSK:!eNULL:!aNULL |
| SIP TLS ciphers | EECDH:EDH:HIGH:-  AES256+SHA:!MEDIUM:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!PSK:!eNULL:+ADH |
| UC server discovery TLS ciphers | EECDH:EDH:HIGH:-  AES256+SHA:!MEDIUM:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!PSK:!eNULL:!aNULL |
| XMPP TLS ciphers | EECDH:EDH:HIGH:-  AES256+SHA:!MEDIUM:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!PSK:!eNULL:!aNULL |
| LDAP TLS ciphers | EECDH:EDH:HIGH:-  AES256+SHA:!MEDIUM:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!PSK:!eNULL:!aNULL |
| TMS TLS ciphers | EECDH:EDH:HIGH:-  AES256+SHA:!MEDIUM:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!PSK:!eNULL:!aNULL |
| SMTP ciphers | EECDH:EDH:HIGH:-  AES256+SHA:!MEDIUM:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!PSK:!eNULL:!aNULL |

#### SIP behavior—disable ADH recommendation

Some endpoints, for example the E20, only support Anonymous Diffie-Hellman (ADH) when you connect to them, so ADH is enabled
in the default cipher suites. However, if it's an inbound connection, for security reasons you should always add `!ADH` to disable it.

Be aware that removing the ADH from SIP will cause the outbound connections to some legacy endpoints to fail.

## Configuring SSH

### Tunnel Configuration

The Expressway pair uses SSH tunnels to securely transfer data from the Expressway-E to the Expressway-C without requiring
Expressway-E to open the connection. The Expressway-C opens a TCP session with the Expressway-E which is listening on a fixed
TCP port. The pair then use the selected cipher and algorithms to establish an encrypted tunnel for securely sharing data.

The cipher and algorithms that the pair use to encrypt SSH tunnels are configured as follows:

1. Go to Maintenance > Security > SSH configuration.
2. Modify the following settings, if necessary:

   | Setting | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | Ciphers | *aes256-ctr*: Advanced Encryption Standard using the CTR (counter) mode to encipher 256-bit blocks. (Default) |
   | Public Key Algorithms | *X509v3-sign-rsa* (Default) *X509v3-ssh-rsa* |
   | Key Exchange Algorithms | *ecdh-sha2-nistp256* *ecdh-sha2-nistp384*(Default) |
3. Click Save.

### Remote Access Configuration

The cipher and algorithms that the pair use to encrypt remote access between a SSH client and server are configured as follows:

1. Go to Maintenance > Security > SSH configuration.
2. Modify the following settings, if necessary:

   | Setting | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | Ciphers | *“aes256-gcm@openssh.com,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr”* |
   | Key Exchange Algorithms | *“ecdh-sha2-nistp521,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp256,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1”* |
   | MAC Algorithms | *“hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha1”* |
3. Click Save.

## Advanced Security

The **Advanced security** page (Maintenance >
Advanced security) is used to configure the Expressway for use in highly secure environments. You need to install the **Advanced Account Security** option key to see this page.

You can configure the system for:

* [Advanced account security mode](#reference_C0FAB0B806FC653F8F43CCAD8AC88F87)
* [FIPS140-2 cryptographic mode](#reference_5962E52A2FA9786EF34FD94A1FE3A0B8)

* [Configuring Advanced Account Security Mode](#reference_C0FAB0B806FC653F8F43CCAD8AC88F87)
* [Configuring FIPS140-2 Cryptographic Mode](#reference_5962E52A2FA9786EF34FD94A1FE3A0B8)

### Configuring Advanced Account Security Mode

Enabling advanced account security limits login access to remotely authenticated users using the web interface only, and also
restricts access to some system features. To indicate that the Expressway is in advanced account security mode, any text specified
as the **Classification banner** message is displayed on every web page.

A system reboot is required for changes to the advanced account security mode to take effect.

#### HTTP methods

The Expressway web server allows the following HTTP methods:

| Method | Used by Web UI? | Used by API? | Used to... |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | Yes | Yes | Retrieve data from a specified resource. For example, to return a specific page in the Expressway web interface. |
| POST | Yes | Yes | Apply data to a web resource. For example, when an administrator saves changes to a setting using the Expressway web interface. |
| OPTIONS | No | Yes | For a specified URL, returns the HTTP methods supported by the server. For example, the Expressway can use OPTIONS to test a proxy server for HTTP/1.1 compliance. |
| PUT | No | Yes | Send a resource to be stored at a specified URI. Our REST API commands use this method to change the Expressway configuration. |
| DELETE | No | Yes | Delete a specified resource. For example, the REST API uses DELETE for record deletion. |

#### How to disable user access to the API

Administrators have API access by default. This can be disabled in two ways:

* If the Expressway is running in advanced account security mode, then API access is automatically disabled for all users.
* API access for individual administrators can be disabled through their user configuration options.

* [Prerequisites](#concept_73A6AB6FD8BC7F14AB22CD026741AFFE)
* [Enabling Advanced Account Security](#task_793B13FFE47777E8B1598CD668CC5930)
* [Expressway Functionality: Changes and Limitations](#concept_7984F10757C16691F2BCC3C4E4CE1252)
* [Disabling Advanced Account Security](#task_F5517892253A0B69B356AE28DF39D1CD)

#### Prerequisites

Before you can enable advanced account security mode, the following items are required:

* The system must be configured to use [remote account authentication](exwy_m_user-accounts.html#concept_27EF4DB0C9EFA01BCB274A443E759CA3) for administrator accounts.
* The **Advanced Account Security** option key must be installed.
* You must create a local administrator account and nominate it as the emergency account, so that you can get in if remote authentication
  is unavailable. You cannot use a remote account for this purpose.

  Do not use the built in *admin* account.

| **Caution** | ---   The Expressway will disallow local authentication by all accounts except the emergency account. Ensure that the remote directory service is working properly before you enable the mode.   --- |

#### Expressway Functionality: Changes and Limitations

When in secure mode, the following changes and limitations to standard Expressway functionality apply:

* Access over SSH and through the serial port is disabled and cannot be turned on (the pwrec password recovery function is also
  unavailable).
* Access over HTTPS is enabled and cannot be turned off.
* The command line interface (CLI) and API access are unavailable.
* Administrator account authentication source is set to *Remote only* and cannot be changed.
* Local authentication is disabled. There is no access using the root account or any local administrator account except the
  emergency account.
* Only the emergency account may change the emergency account.
* If you are using certificate-based authentication, the emergency account must be authenticated by credentials in the client's
  certificate. See [Emergency Account and Certificate-based Authentication](#reference_B071610B3E8B848BC5A7D21074D69545).
* If there are three consecutive failed attempts to log in (by the same or different users), login access to the Expressway
  is blocked for 60 seconds.
* Immediately after logging in, the current user is shown statistics of when they previously logged in and details of any failed
  attempts to log in using that account.
* Administrator accounts with read-only or read-write access levels cannot view the Event Log, Configuration Log and Network
  Log pages. These pages can be viewed only by accounts with *Auditor* access level.
* The **Upgrade** page only displays the **System platform** component.

The Event Log, Configuration Log, Network Log, call history, search history and registration history are cleared whenever
the Expressway is taken out of advanced account security mode.

| **Note** | ---   If [intrusion protection](exwy_m_network-and-system-settings.html#reference_C2F36B56C07F9273A3E3F4BDD1D75348) is enabled, this will cause any existing blocked addresses to become unblocked.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Disabling Advanced Account Security

| **Note** | ---   This operation wipes all configuration. You cannot maintain any configuration or history when exiting this mode. The system returns to factory state.   --- |

### Configuring FIPS140-2 Cryptographic Mode

FIPS140 is a U.S. and Canadian government standard that specifies security requirements for cryptographic modules. FIPS140-1
became a mandatory standard for the protection of sensitive data in 1994 and was superseded by FIPS140-2 in 2001. Expressway
X8.8 or later implements FIPS140-2 compliant features.

When in FIPS140-2 cryptographic mode, system performance may be affected due to the increased cryptographic workload.

You can cluster Expressways that have FIPS140-2 mode enabled.

* [Prerequisites](#Cisco_Concept.dita_93485feb-510c-4e09-8c7f-15797dfef9d6)
* [Enable FIPS 140-2 Cryptographic Mode](#task_EE52CE081E6B27C7FBDFE163311707BF)

#### Prerequisites

Before you enable FIPS140-2 mode:

* Ensure that the system is not using NTLM protocol challenges with a direct Active Directory Service connection for device
  authentication; NTLM cannot be used while in FIPS140-2 mode.
* If login authentication via a remote LDAP server is configured, ensure that it uses TLS encryption if it is using SASL binding.
* The **Advanced Account Security** option key must be installed.

FIPS140-2 compliance also requires the following restrictions:

* System-wide SIP transport mode settings must be TLS: *On*, TCP: *Off* and UDP: *Off*.
* All SIP zones must use TLS.
* SNMP and NTP server connections should use strong hashing and encryption. Use these settings:

  **System > SNMP > v3 Authentication > Type =** *SHA*

  **System > SNMP > v3 Privacy > Type =** *AES*

  **System > Time > NTP server *n* > Authentication=** *Symmetric key*

  **System > Time > NTP server *n* > Hash=** *SHA-1*

If your system is running as a virtualized application and has never been through an upgrade process, perform a system upgrade
before you continue. You can upgrade the system to the same software release version that it is currently running. If you
do not complete this step, the activation process described below will fail.

#### Enable FIPS 140-2 Cryptographic Mode

| **Caution** | ---   The transition to FIPS 140-2 cryptographic mode requires a system reset to be performed. This will remove all existing configuration data. To preserve your data you should take a backup immediately prior to performing the reset, and then restore the backup file when the reset has completed.  The reset removes all administrator account information and reinstates the default security certificates. To log in after the reset has completed you will have to first complete the Install Wizard.  To turn your system into a compliant FIPS 140-2 cryptographic system:   --- |
| --- | --- |

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Enable FIPS 140-2 cryptographic mode:   1. Go to Maintenance >     Advanced security. 2. Set FIPS 140-2 cryptographic mode to *On*. 3. Click Save. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Fix any alarms that have been raised that report non-compliant configuration.   | **Note** | When you enable FIPS in a Mobile and Remote Access scenario, if alarm #40042 (some SIP configuration is not using TLS transport; FIPS 140-2 compliance requires TLS) is raised you can disable and enable this feature to clear the alarm. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | Take a [system backup](exwy_m_maintenance.html#reference_7C29075A55A5FF588C4C3CBC51F968CC) if you want to preserve your current configuration data.   | **Note** | Ensure that all backups require password protection. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | Reset the system and complete the activation of FIPS140-2 mode:   1. Log in to Expressway as **root**. 2. Type `fips-activate`.   The reset takes up to 30 minutes to complete. |
| **Step 5** | Follow the prompts to complete the Install Wizard. |
| **Step 6** | When the system has applied the configuration and restarted, log in as `admin` using the password you set.  You may see alarms related to non-compliance with FIPS 140-2. Ignore these alarms if you intend to restore the backup taken prior to the reset. You must take action if they persist after restoring the backup. |
| **Step 7** | [Restore](exwy_m_maintenance.html#reference_2AC16E90D5165F414B44437BC7D8E348) your previous data, if required.   | **Note** | While in FIPS 140-2 mode, you can only restore backup files that were taken when FIPS 140-2 cryptographic mode is set to *On*. Any previous administrator account information and passwords will be restored however, the previous **root** account password is not restored. If the data you are restoring contains untrusted security certificates, the restart that occurs as part of the restore process may take up to 6 minutes to complete. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 8** | From X12.6 you must manually change the SIP TLS Diffie-Hellman key size from the default 1024 bits, to at least 2048. To do this type the following command in the Expressway command line interface (change the value in the final element if you want a key size higher than 2048): *xconfiguration SIP Advanced SipTlsDhKeySize: "2048"* |

---

* [FIPS140-2 Compliant Features](#concept_B2D04FF51152A23D06BD09CE29CD6BFF)

| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.1 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 6.7 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 6.7 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 6.7 |

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.
2. Click the **Add Notification** button and follow the instructions.

## Public Relations or Press Queries Regarding Cisco Security Vulnerability Information

The following table shows the Cisco press contacts for Cisco security vulnerability information.

|  | **Press Contacts** |
| --- | --- |
| **Michael Ricketts** | Email: micricke@cisco.comPhone: +1 919 392 2756 |
| **Additional Public Relations** | media\_pr@cisco.com |

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

## Network Settings

This section describes network services and settings related options that appear under the System menu of the web interface.
These options enable you to configure the Expressway in relation to the network in which it is located, for example its IP
settings, firewall rules, intrusion protection and the external services used by the Expressway (for example, DNS, NTP, and
SNMP).

### Ethernet Settings

| **Note** | ---   The speed settings on this page are for systems running on Cisco Expressway physical appliances only. They do not apply to virtual machine (VM)-based systems. The connection speed shown for VM systems is invalid, and always appears as 10000 Mb/s regardless of the actual speed of the underlying physical NIC(s). This is because VMs cannot retrieve the actual speed from the physical NIC.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The **Ethernet** page (System >
Network interfaces >
Ethernet) displays the connection speeds between Expressway and the Ethernet networks to which it is connected. As the Expressway
only supports auto-negotiation, the **Speed** is always *Auto*. The Expressway and the connected switch automatically negotiate the speed and the duplex mode for the connection.

### Configuring IP Settings

The **IP** page (System >
Network interfaces >
IP) is used to configure the IP protocols and network interface settings of the Expressway.

#### IP Protocol Configuration

You can configure whether the Expressway uses IPv4, IPv6, or both versions of the IP protocol suite. The default is *Both*.

* *IPv4 only*: it only accepts registrations from endpoints using an IPv4 address, and only takes calls between two endpoints communicating
  via IPv4. It communicates with other systems via IPv4 only.
* *IPv6 only*: it only accepts registrations from endpoints using an IPv6 address, and only takes calls between two endpoints communicating
  via IPv6. It communicates with other systems via IPv6 only.
* *Both*: it accepts registrations from endpoints using either an IPv4 or IPv6 address, and takes calls using either protocol. If
  a call is between an IPv4-only and an IPv6-only endpoint, the Expressway acts as an IPv4 to IPv6 gateway. It communicates
  with other systems via either protocol.

Some endpoints support both IPv4 and IPv6, however an endpoint can use only one protocol when registering with the Expressway.
Which protocol it uses is determined by the format used to specify the IP address of the Expressway on the endpoint. After
the endpoint has registered using either IPv4 or IPv6, the Expressway only sends calls to it using this addressing scheme.
Calls made to that endpoint from another device using the other addressing scheme are converted (gatewayed) by the Expressway.

All IPv6 addresses configured on the Expressway are treated as having a /64 network prefix length.

#### IPv4 to IPv6 Interworking

The Expressway can act as a gateway for calls between IPv4 and IPv6 devices. To enable this feature, select an **IP protocol** of *Both*. Calls for which the Expressway is acting as an IPv4 to IPv6 gateway are traversal calls and require a Rich Media Session
license.

#### IP Gateways

You can set the default **IPv4 gateway** and **IPv6 gateway** used by the Expressway. These are the gateways to which IP requests are sent for IP addresses that do not fall within the
Expressway’s local subnet.

* The default **IPv4 gateway** is 127.0.0.1, which should be changed during the commissioning process.
* The **IPv6 gateway**, if entered, must be a static global IPv6 address. It cannot be a link-local or a stateless auto-configuration (SLAAC) IPv6
  address.

#### LAN Configuration

LAN 1 is the primary network port on the Expressway. You can configure the **IPv4 address and subnet mask**, the **IPv6 address** and the **Maximum transmission unit (MTU)** for this port. The Expressway is shipped with a default IP address of 192.168.0.100 (for both LAN ports). This lets you connect
the Expressway to your network and access it via the default address so that you can configure it remotely.

The **IPv6 address**, if entered, must be a static global IPv6 address. It cannot be a link-local or stateless auto-configuration (SLAAC) address.

The **Maximum transmission unit (MTU)** defaults to 1500 bytes.

If you have **Advanced Networking** enabled, you can also configure these options for the LAN 2 port.

#### Dedicated Management Interface

If you want to enable the Expressway's DMI:

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Set **Use Dedicated Management Interface** to *Yes*. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the **LAN3 - DMI** section:   1. Specify the IPv4 and/or IPv6 address of the LAN3 port. 2. For IPv4 also specify the subnet mask. 3. For IPv6 use a static, global address. It cannot be link-local or stateless SLAAC. 4. Optionally change the maximum Ethernet packet size that can be sent over the DMI by setting the **Maximum transmission unit (MTU)** for the port. The default is 1500 bytes. |
| **Step 3** | Restart the system. These changes require a restart to take effect.  The DMI is now activated on LAN3 as an interface for management traffic. If you want the DMI to be the *sole* interface for management, go on to the next tasks. |

---

##### What to do next

[(Optional) Make DMI Sole Interface](#reference_5F3C968EEAA4316F65F3DE2BDE5CD76C)

* [Make DMI Sole Interface](#reference_5F3C968EEAA4316F65F3DE2BDE5CD76C)

##### Make DMI Sole Interface

###### (Optional) Make DMI Sole Interface - Server Management Traffic

Use this task to make management traffic use the DMI, where Expressway is the server.

1. You can do this for administration services (web user interface, REST API, and CLI) and/or for SNMP. Do either or both the
   following steps, depending on which services you want to configure for DMI only:

   * Go to the System >
     SNMP page and in the **Configuration** section set **Use Dedicated Management Interface** only to *Yes*.
   * Go to the System >
     Administration settings page and in the **Services** section set **Use Dedicated Management Interface only (for administration)** to *Yes*.
2. You need to restart the system for the changes to take effect for the web user interface and the API, which remain accessible
   from LAN1 / LAN2 until you restart. Changes take immediate effect for the command line interface (SSH) and SNMP service, regardless
   of restart.

The specified management services can now be accessed only from the DMI / LAN3 port.

| **Note** | ---   Expressway will not let you disable the DMI while a management service is configured to use it as the only interface.   --- |
| --- | --- |

###### (Optional) Make DMI Sole Interface - Client Management Traffic Outside Subnet

Depending on the Expressway software version, for management traffic where Expressway acts as the client, the traffic may
only be directed to the DMI if the target server is in the same subnet as the DMI / LAN3 port. Check your release notes to
see if this issue applies. If it does, and if it's not possible to deploy the server in the same subnet as LAN3, you can optionally
force Expressway management traffic to use the DMI, by configuring static IP routes for LAN3 per service.

#### About Advanced Networking and Dual Network Interfaces

The Advanced Networking feature enables the LAN 2 Ethernet port on the Expressway-E, to allow a secondary IP address for the
Expressway. It also includes support for deployments where the Expressway-E is located behind a static NAT device, allowing
it to have separate public and private IP addresses.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/450001-460000/454001-455000/454322.jpg)

#### Configuring Dual Network Interfaces

Dual network interfaces are **only supported on Expressway-E** systems; you cannot deploy them on an Expressway-C.

Dual network interfaces are intended for deployments where the Expressway-E is located in a DMZ between two separate firewalls
on separate network segments. In such deployments, routers prevent devices on the internal network from being able to route
IP traffic to the public internet, and instead the traffic must pass through an application proxy such as the Expressway-E.

* [To enable dual network interfaces](#task_45602B3A7EFF15326359A1ECBB7905A1)

##### To enable dual network interfaces

###### Before you begin

* Configure the LAN 1 port and restart the Expressway before you configure the LAN 2 port.
* The LAN 1 and LAN 2 interfaces must be on different, non-overlapping subnets.
* If the Expressway-E is in the DMZ, the outside IP address of the Expressway-E must be a public IP address, or if static NAT
  mode is enabled, the static NAT address must be publicly accessible.
* The Expressway-E may also be used to traverse internal firewalls within an enterprise. In this case the "public" IP address may not be publicly accessible, but is an IP address accessible to other parts of the enterprise.
* If you need to change the IP addresses on one or both interfaces, you can do it via the UI or the CLI. You can change both
  at the same time if required, and the new addresses take effect after a restart.

###### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Set **Use dual network interfaces** to *Yes*. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Select *LAN2* as the interface in the **External LAN interface** setting.  You can now choose to enable static NAT on the external interface. This setting also determines which port allocates TURN server relays.  Troubleshooting Tips:If you have Advanced Networking enabled but only want to configure one of the Ethernet ports, switch **Use dual network interfaces** to *No* |

---

#### Configuring Static NAT

You can deploy the Expressway-E behind a static NAT device, allowing it to have separate public and private IP addresses.
This feature is intended for use in deployments where the Expressway-E is located in a DMZ, and has the **Advanced Networking** feature enabled.

In these deployments, the externally-facing LAN port has static NAT enabled in order to use both a private and public IPv4
address. The internally facing LAN port does not have static NAT enabled and uses a single IP address. In such a deployment,
traversal clients should be configured to use the internally-facing IP address of the Expressway-E.

* [To enable static NAT](#task_F88DC26B8E5FAF630BC9DFE812C0937A)

##### To enable static NAT

For the externally-facing LAN port, specify the following settings:
###### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the **IPv4 address** field, enter the private IP address of the port. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Set **IPv4 static NAT mode** to *On*. |
| **Step 3** | In the **IPv4 static NAT address** field, enter the public IP address of the port - the IP address as it appears after translation (outside the NAT element). |

---

### IPv6 Mode Features and Limitations

When you set the IP interfaces of the Expressway to *IPv6 Only* mode, those interfaces only use IPv6. They do not use IPv4 to communicate with other systems, and they do not interwork between
IPv4 and IPv6 (Dual stack).

* [Explicit IPv6 Supported Features](#concept_7645D123E1A47612262DDDD148B058AB)
* [Supported RFCs](#concept_991D5BF7AFA513B29EB5EE2274B23916)
* [Known Limitations in IPv6 Mode](#concept_78BA1CE457630B13F57C6A9806585B42)

#### Explicit IPv6 Supported Features

* Calls between Expressway-registered IPv6 endpoints.
* DiffServ traffic class (TC) tagging.
* TURN server (on Expressway-E).
* Automated intrusion protection.
* DNS lookups.
* Port usage and status pages.

#### Supported RFCs

* RFC 2460: Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification (partially implemented: static global addresses only).
* RFC 2464: Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks.
* RFC 3596: DNS Extensions to Support IP Version 6.
* RFC 4213: Basic Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers.
* RFC 4291: IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture.
* RFC 4443: Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6) for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Specification.
* RFC 4861: Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6).
* RFC 5095: Deprecation of Type 0 Routing Headers in IPv6.
* RFC 6156: Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) Extension for IPv6.

#### Known Limitations in IPv6 Mode

* IPv6 addresses must be static; they cannot be link-local or SLAAC addresses.
* You must restart the Expressway when you change its IP address or its gateway's IP address.
* Mobile and Remote Access (MRA) is not tested or supported in IPv6 mode. For MRA, the primary call control agent is Unified
  CM which does not support IPv6.
* Getting revocation status from distributed Certificate Revocation Lists is not supported in IPv6 mode.

### Configuring DNS Settings

The **DNS** page (System >
DNS) is used to configure DNS servers and DNS settings on the Expressway.

* [Configuring the System Host Name and Domain Name](#reference_3DC581E69F60CB5A1BE6AD9D664D3601)
* [Configuring DNS Server Addresses](#reference_55F8466EABB9FC422550EBEE4E02C8AF)
* [Caching DNS Records](#concept_33EDFE4A081BD207C16287CCD38DB08D)

#### Configuring the System Host Name and Domain Name

The **System host name** defines the DNS host name that this Expressway is known by.

* It must be unique for each peer in a cluster.
* It is used to identify the Expressway on a remote log server (a default name of "TANDBERG" is used if the **System host name** is not specified).
* It must contain only letters, digits, hyphens, and underscore. The first character must be a letter, and the last character
  must be a letter or a digit.

The **Domain name** is used when attempting to resolve unqualified server addresses (for example, ldapserver). It's appended to the unqualified server address before the query is sent to the DNS server. If the server address is fully
qualified (for example, ldapserver.mydomain.com) or is in the form of an IP address, the domain name is not appended to the server address before querying the DNS server.
The domain name applies to the following Expressway configuration settings:

* LDAP server
* NTP server
* External Manager server
* Remote logging server

We recommend using an IP address or FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) for all server addresses (The FQDN of the Expressway
is the **System host name** plus the **Domain name**.)

##### Impact on SIP messaging

The **System host name** and **Domain name** are also used to identify references to this Expressway in SIP messaging, where an endpoint has configured the Expressway
as its SIP proxy in the form of an FQDN (as opposed to an IP address, which is not recommended).

In this case the Expressway may, for example, reject an INVITE request if the FQDN configured on the endpoint does not match
the **System host name** and **Domain name** configured on the Expressway.

| **Note** | ---   This check occurs because the SIP proxy FQDN is included in the route header of the SIP request sent by the endpoint to the Expressway.   --- |
| --- | --- |

##### Custom domain searches

The **Search domains** setting is relevant for Edge deployments where the external hosts are in a different DNS domain from Expressway-C, and are
configured with non-qualified hostnames. You can optionally use this setting to specify one or more DNS domains. The Expressway
appends these domains one by one, to the unqualified hostname and queries DNS for the resultant FQDN. It repeats this process
until DNS returns an IP address. This means that there's no need to enter FQDNs when configuring connections between hosts.

Use a space to separate multiple addresses.

##### DNS requests

By default, DNS requests use a random port from within the system's ephemeral port range. If required, you can specify a custom
port range instead by setting **DNS requests port range** to *Use a custom port range* and then defining the **DNS requests port range start** and **DNS requests port range end** fields.

| **Note** | ---   Setting a small source port range will increase your vulnerability to DNS spoofing attacks.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Configuring DNS Server Addresses

You must specify at least one DNS server to be queried for address resolution if you want to use the following:

* FQDNs instead of IP addresses when specifying external addresses (for example, for LDAP and NTP servers, neighbor zones, and
  peers).
* Features like [URI Dialing](exwy_m_dial-plan-and-call-processing.html#concept_5BB8855CD118F54B4D69AA68B0AD26E0) or [ENUM Dialing](exwy_m_dial-plan-and-call-processing.html#concept_F57BAE133686D54315C67A3493E9C9FE).

##### Default DNS servers

You can specify up to five default DNS servers. The Expressway only queries one server at a time. If that server is unavailable
the Expressway tries another server from the list.

The order that the servers are specified is not significant. The Expressway favors servers that were last known to be available.

##### Per-domain DNS servers

As well as the five default DNS servers, you can specify up to five additional explicit DNS servers for specified domains.
This can be useful in deployments where specific domain hierarchies need to be routed to their explicit authorities.

For each additional per-domain DNS server address you can specify up to two  **Domain names**. Any DNS queries under those domains are forwarded to the specified DNS server instead of the default DNS servers.

To specify redundant per-domain servers, add an additional per-domain DNS server address and associate it with the same **Domain names**. DNS requests for those domains are sent in parallel to both DNS servers.

You can use the [DNS lookup](exwy_m_diagnostics-and-troubleshooting.html#reference_C0EC17D684FB8EC69A86636D14E0537B) tool (Maintenance >
Tools >
Network utilities >
DNS lookup) to check which domain name server (DNS server) is responding to a request for a particular hostname.

##### Transport protocols

The Expressway uses UDP and TCP to do DNS resolution, and DNS servers usually send both UDP and TCP responses. If the UDP
response exceeds the UDP message size limit of 512 bytes, then the Expressway cannot process the UDP response. This is not
usually a problem, because the Expressway can process the TCP response instead.

However, if you block TCP inbound on port 53, and if the UDP response is greater than 512 bytes, then the Expressway cannot
process the response from the DNS. In this case you won't see the results using the DNS lookup tool, and any operations that
need the requested addresses will fail.

#### Caching DNS Records

DNS lookups may be cached to improve performance. The cache is flushed automatically whenever the DNS configuration is changed,
and you can optionally force a flush by clicking Flush DNS cache.

### Configuring DSCP / Quality of Service Settings

* [About DSCP Marking](#reference_F787B71355AE4C44CDE2D8A359FBB051)
* [Configuring DSCP Values](#concept_D645BF0D2D1E84C34D39B60A5C0FDC75)

#### About DSCP Marking

From X8.9, the Expressway supports improved DSCP (Differentiated Service Code Point) packet marking for traffic passing through
the firewall, including Mobile and Remote Access. DSCP is a measure of the Quality of Service level of the packet. To provide
more granular control of traffic prioritization, DSCP values are set (marked) for these individual traffic types:

| Traffic type | Supplied default value | Web UI field |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Video | 34 | QoS Video |
| Audio | 46 | QoS Audio |
| XMPP | 24 | QoS XMPP |
| Signaling | 24 | QoS Signaling |

Before X8.9 you had to apply DSCP values to all signaling and media traffic collectively.

You can optionally change the default DSCP values from the System >
Quality of Service web UI page (or the CLI).

##### Notes:

* DSCP value "0" specifies standard best-effort service.
* DSCP marking is applied to SIP and H.323 traffic.
* DSCP marking is applied to TURN media, providing the TURN traffic is actually handled by the Expressway.
* Traffic type "Video" is assigned by default if the media type cannot be identified. (For example, if different media types are multiplexed on
  the same port.)

##### Existing QoS/DSCP Commands and API are Discontinued

| **Note** | ---   From X8.9 we no longer support the previous methods to specify QoS/DSCP values. The former Web UI settings QoS Mode and QoS Value, CLI commands `xConfiguration IP QoS Mode` and `xConfiguration IP QoS Value` and corresponding API are now discontinued. Do not use these commands.   --- |
| --- | --- |

##### What if I currently use these commands?

When you upgrade the Expressway, any existing QoS value you have defined is automatically applied to the new fields and replaces
the supplied defaults. For example, if you had a value of 20 defined, all four DSCP settings (QoS Audio, QoS Video, QoS XMPP,
QoS Signaling) are set to 20 also.

We don't support downgrades. If you need to revert to your pre-upgrade software version, the QoS settings are reset to their
original supplied defaults. So QoS Mode is set to None and QoS Value is set to 0. You will need to manually redefine the values
you want to use.

#### Configuring DSCP Values

To optionally change the supplied DSCP default values, go to the Quality of Service page (System >
Quality of Service) and specify the new values you want to use.

### Static Routes

You can define static routes from the Expressway to an IPv4 or IPv6 address range. Go to System >
Network interfaces >
Static routes.

On this page you can view, add, and delete static routes.

Static routes are sometimes required when using the **Advanced Networking** option and deploying the Expressway in a DMZ. They may also be required in other complex network deployments.

* [To add a static route:](#task_5DE3A501613D9572E12B86E779138123)

#### To add a static route:

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Enter the base destination address of the new static route from this Expressway.  For example, enter `203.0.113.0 or 2001:db8::` |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Enter the prefix length that defines the range.  Extending the example, you could enter `24` to define the IPv4 range 203.0.113.0 - 203.0.113.255, or `32` to define the IPv6 range 2001:db8:: to 2001:db8:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff.  The address range field shows the range calculated by the Expressway from the IP address and Prefix length. |
| **Step 3** | Enter the IP address of the gateway for your new route. |
| **Step 4** | Select an ethernet interface for your new route.  This option is only available if the second ethernet interface is enabled. Select *LAN 1* or *LAN 2* to force the route via that interface, or select  *Auto* to allow the Expressway to make this route on either interface. |
| **Step 5** | Click Create route.  The new static route is listed in the table. You can delete routes from this table if necessary.   | **Note** | * IP routes can also be configured using the CLI, using  [xCommand RouteAdd](exwy_m_reference-material.html#reference_BFDAA3467CD49A9CE98E1A8A91D43878__) and the [xConfiguration IP Route](exwy_m_reference-material.html#reference_D1AB5A49A289A65A0AE1A7C0761C455C__) commands. * You can configure routes for up to 50 network and host combinations. * Do not configure IP routes by logging in as `root` and using `ip route` statements. | | --- | --- | |

* [Configuring rate limits](#reference_A17BB2CD899622AEA310351B14CA7E50)

### Configuring Firewall Rules

Firewall rules provide the ability to configure IP table rules to control access to the Expressway at the IP level. On the
Expressway, these rules have been classified into groups and are applied in the following order:

* **Dynamic system rules**: these rules ensure that all established connections/sessions are maintained. They also include any rules that have been
  inserted by the automated detection feature as it blocks specific addresses. Finally, it includes a rule to allow access from
  the loopback interface.
* **Non-configurable application rules**: this incorporates all necessary application-specific rules, for example to allow SNMP traffic and H.323 gatekeeper discovery.
* **User-configurable rules**: this incorporates all of the manually configured firewall rules (as described in this section) that refine — and typically
  restrict — what can access the Expressway. There is a final rule in this group that allows all traffic destined for the Expressway
  LAN 1 interface (and the LAN 2 interface if the  **Advanced Networking** option key is installed).

There is also a final, non-configurable rule that drops any broadcast or multicast traffic that has not already been specifically
allowed or denied by the previous rules.

By default any traffic that is destined for the specific IP address of the Expressway is allowed access, but that traffic
will be dropped if the Expressway is not explicitly listening for it. You have to actively configure extra rules to lock down
the system to your specifications.

| **Note** | ---   Return traffic from outbound connections is always accepted.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### User-configured rules

The user-configured rules are typically used to restrict what can access the Expressway. You can:

* Specify the source IP address subnet from which to allow or deny traffic.
* Choose whether to drop or reject denied traffic.

  For certain scenarios, even if there is a firewall rule to drop or reject certain inbound traffic, the Expressway still proxies
  the traffic. This is because firewall rules apply only to new inbound traffic. If the device on the internal network initiates
  the outbound connection, the device on the external network uses the same ports to response. It takes high priority than the
  firewall rules since the IP table contains the existing media path information.
* Configure well known services such as SSH, HTTP/HTTPS or specify customized rules based on transport protocols and port ranges.
* Configure different rules for the LAN 1 and LAN 2 interfaces (if the  **Advanced Networking** option key is installed), although note that you cannot configure specific destination addresses such as a multicast address.
* Specify the priority order in which the rules are applied.

* [Setting Up and Activating Firewall Rules](#concept_2EB69543CD4A2D9FA467C629C6ECFF1B)
* [Rule settings](#concept_5F13545F7DB866A03A322D1FD5AB1404)

#### Setting Up and Activating Firewall Rules

Use the **Firewall rules configuration** page to set up and activate a new set of firewall rules.

The set of rules shown is initially a copy of the current active rules. (On a system where no firewall rules have been defined,
the list is empty.) If you have a lot of rules you can use the Filter options to limit the set of rules displayed.

| **Note** | ---   The built-in rules are not shown in this list.   --- |
| --- | --- |

You can change the set of firewall rules by adding new rules, or by modifying or deleting existing ones. Changes to the current
active rules are held in a pending state. When you finish making changes, you activate the new rules to replace the previous
set. For UDP-related rules, note that new rules only take effect at the next system reboot (although if you delete UDP rules,
they become inactive as soon as you activate the rule set).

| **Step 2** | Make your changes by adding, modifying, or deleting rules as required.  To change the order of the rules, use the up/down arrows  and  to swap the priorities of adjacent rules.   * New or modified rules are shown as **Pending** (in the **State** column). * Deleted rules are shown as **Pending delete**. |
| **Step 3** | When you finish configuring the new set of firewall rules, click Activate firewall rules. |
| **Step 4** | Confirm that you want to activate the new rules. This will replace the existing set of active rules with the set you have just configured.  After confirming that you want to activate the new rules, they are validated and any errors reported. |
| **Step 5** | If there are no errors, the new rules are temporarily activated and you are taken to the Firewall rules confirmation page.  You now have 15 seconds to confirm that you want to keep the new rules:   * Click Accept changes to permanently apply the rules. * If the 15 seconds time limit expires or you click Rollback changes, the previous rules are reinstated and you are taken back to the configuration page.  The automatic rollback mechanism provided by the 15 seconds time limit ensures that the client system that activated the changes   is still able to access the system after the new rules have been applied. If the client system is unable to confirm the changes   (because it can no longer access the web interface) then the rollback will ensure that its ability to access the system is   reinstated. |
| **Step 6** | This step only applies if you add UDP rules. That is, one or more custom rules with **Transport=***UDP*. New UDP rules do not take effect until the next system reboot. In this special case, activating the firewall rules is not sufficient by itself. Deleted UDP rules do not have this requirement, and become inactive as soon as you activate the rule set.  When configuring firewall rules, you also have the option to Revert all changes. This discards all pending changes and resets the working copy of the rules to match the current active rules. |

---

#### Rule settings

The configurable options for each rule are:

| Field | Description | Usage tips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Priority** | The order in which the firewall rules are applied. | The rules with the highest priority (1, then 2, then 3 and so on) are applied first.  Firewall rules must have unique priorities. Rule activation will fail if there are multiple rules with the same priority. |
| **Interface** | The LAN interface on which you want to control access. | This only applies if the Advanced Networking option key is installed. |
| **IP address** and **Prefix length** | These two fields together determine the range of IP addresses to which the rule applies. | The Address range field shows the range of IP addresses to which the rule applies, based on the combination of the **IP address** and **Prefix length**.  The prefix length range is 0-32 for an IPv4 address, and 0-128 for an IPv6 address. |
| **Service** | Choose the service to which the rule applies, or choose *Custom* to specify your own transport type and port ranges. | | **Note** | If the destination port of a service is subsequently reconfigured on the Expressway, for example from 80 to 8080, any firewall rules containing the old port number will not be automatically updated. | | --- | --- | |
| **Transport** | The transport protocol to which the rule applies. | Only applies if specifying a *Custom* service. |
| **Start and end port** | The port range to which the rule applies. | Only applies if specifying a UDP or TCP *Custom* service. |
| **Action** | The action to take against any IP traffic that matches the rule.  *Allow*: Accept the traffic.  *Drop:* Drop the traffic without any response to the sender.  *Reject:* Reject the traffic with an "unreachable" response. | Dropping the traffic means that potential attackers are not provided with information as to which device is filtering the packets or why.  For deployments in a secure environment, you may want to configure a set of low priority rules (for example, priority 50000) that deny access to all services and then configure higher priority rules (for example, priority 20) that selectively allow access for specific IP addresses. |
| **Description** | An optional free-form description of the firewall rule. | If you have a lot of rules you can use the  **Filter** by description options to find related sets of rules. |

### Current Active Firewall Rules

The **Current active firewall rules** page (System >
Protection >
Firewall rules >
Current active rules) shows the user-configured firewall rules that are currently in place on the system. There is also a set of built-in rules
that are not shown in this list.

If you want to change the rules you must go to the **Firewall rules configuration** page from where you can set up and activate a new set of rules.

### Configuring Automated Intrusion Protection

You can use the automated protection service to detect and block malicious traffic and to help protect the Expressway from
dictionary-based attempts to breach login security.

It works by parsing the system log files to detect repeated failures to access specific service categories, such as SIP, SSH
and web/HTTPS access. When the number of failures within a specified time window reaches the configured threshold, the source
host address (the intruder) and destination port are blocked for a specified period of time. The host address is automatically
unblocked after that time period so as not to lock out any genuine hosts that may have been temporarily misconfigured.

You can configure ranges of addresses that are exempted from one or more categories (see [Configuring Exemptions](#task_EC6F7755258E5349E2A05F76ADD82F7D)).

You should use automated protection in combination with [firewall rules](#reference_44F337305232FA0214D2CD1B2BCCEFFF); automated protection to dynamically detect and temporarily block specific threats, and firewall rules to permanently block
a range of known host addresses.

#### About Protection Categories

The set of available protection categories on your Expressway are pre-configured according to the software version that is
running. You can enable, disable or configure each category, but you cannot add new categories.

The rules which associate specific log file messages with each category are also pre-configured and you cannot change them.
You can view example log file entries that would be treated as an access failure/intrusion within a particular category by
going to System >
Protection >
 Automated detection >
Configuration and clicking on the name of the category. The examples are displayed above the **Status** section at the bottom of the page.

#### Enabling Automated Protection

From X8.9, automated intrusion protection is enabled by default for various categories, including the following:

* HTTP proxy authentication failure
* HTTP proxy protocol violation
* SSH authorization failure
* SSH protocol violation
* XMPP protocol violation

This change affects new systems. Upgraded systems keep their existing protection configuration.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to System >   Administration. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Set **Automated protection service** to *On*. |
| **Step 3** | Click Save.  The service is running now, but you must configure the protection categories and any exemptions necessary for your environment. |

---

#### Configuring Protection Categories

The Automated detection overview page (System >
Protection >
Automated detection >
Configuration) is used to enable and configure the Expressway's protection categories, and to view current activity.

The page displays a summary of all available categories, showing:

* **Status**: This indicates if the category is configured to be *On* or *Off*. When *On*, it additionally indicates the state of the category: this is normally *Active*, but may temporarily display *Initializing* or *Shutting down* when a category has just been enabled or disabled. Check the alarms if it displays *Failed*.)
* **Currently blocked**: The number of addresses currently being blocked for this category.
* **Total failures**: The total number of failed attempts to access the services associated with this category.
* **Total blocks**: The total number of times that a block has been triggered.

  | **Note** | ---  + The **Total blocks** will typically be less than the **Total failures** (unless the **Trigger level** is set to 1). + The same address can be blocked and released several times per category, with each occurrence counting as a separate block.  --- |
  | --- | --- |
* **Exemptions**: The number of addresses that are configured as exempt from this category.

From this page, you can also view any currently blocked addresses or any exemptions that apply to a particular category.

* [Enabling or Disabling Categories](#task_2DF575CB179365EDDEC45B02072A5A36)
* [Configuring a Category's Blocking Rules](#task_2833CB6133B10DE963FABDFD158E9377)

##### Enabling or Disabling Categories

###### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to System >  Protection >  Automated detection >  Configuration. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Select the check box alongside the categories you want to enable or disable. |
| **Step 3** | Click Enable or Disable as appropriate. |

---

##### Configuring a Category's Blocking Rules

###### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to System >  Protection >  Automated detection >  Configuration. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click on the name of the category you want to configure. You are taken to the configuration page for that category. |
| **Step 3** | Configure the category as required:   * **State**: Whether protection for that category is enabled or disabled. * **Description**: A free-form description of the category. * **Trigger level and Detection window**: These settings combine to define the blocking threshold for the category. They specify the number of failed access attempts   that must occur before the block is triggered, and the time window in which those failures must occur. * **Block duration**: The period of time for which the block will remain in place. |
| **Step 4** | Click Save. |

---

#### Configuring Exemptions

The Automated detection exemptions page (System >
Protection >
Automated detection >
Exemptions) is used to configure any IP addresses that are to be exempted always from one or more protection categories.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to System >  Protection >  Automated detection >  Exemptions. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click on the Address you want to configure, or click New to specify a new address. |
| **Step 3** | Enter the `Address` and `Prefix length` to define the range of IP addresses you want to exempt. |
| **Step 4** | Select the categories from which the address is to be exempted. |
| **Step 5** | Click Add address.   | **Note** | If you exempt an address that is currently blocked, it will remain blocked until its block duration expires (unless you unblock it manually via the **Blocked addresses** page). | | --- | --- | |

---

#### Managing Blocked Addresses

The **Blocked addresses** page (System >
Protection >
Automated detection >
Blocked addresses) is used to manage the addresses that are currently blocked by the automated protection service:

* It shows all currently blocked addresses and from which categories those addresses have been blocked.
* You can unblock an address, or unblock an address and at the same time add it to the exemption list. Note that if you want
  to permanently block an address, you must add it to the set of configured [firewall rules](#reference_44F337305232FA0214D2CD1B2BCCEFFF).

If you access this page via the links on the **Automated detection overview** page it is filtered according to your chosen category. It also shows the amount of time left before an address is unblocked
from that category.

#### Investigating Access Failures and Intrusions

If you need to investigate specific access failures or intrusion attempts, you can review all the relevant triggering log
messages associated with each category. To do this:

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to System >  Protection >  Automated detection >  Configuration. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click on the name of the category you want to investigate. |
| **Step 3** | Click View all matching intrusion protection triggers for this category.  The system will display all the relevant events for that category. You can then search through the list of triggering events for the relevant event details such as a user name, address or alias. |

---

#### Automated Protection Service and Clustered Systems

When the automated protection service is enabled in a clustered system:

* Each peer maintains its own count of connection failures and the trigger threshold must be reached on each peer for the intruder's
  address to be blocked by that peer.
* Addresses are blocked against only the peer on which the access failures occurred. This means that if an address is blocked
  against one peer it may still be able to attempt to access another peer (from which it may too become blocked).
* A blocked address can only be unblocked for the current peer. If an address is blocked by another peer, you must log in to
  that peer and then unblock it.
* Category settings and the exemption list are applied across the cluster.
* The statistics displayed on the **Automated detection overview** page are for the current peer only.

#### Automated Protection in MRA Deployments

The Expressway-C receives a lot of inbound traffic from Unified CM and from the Expressway-E when it is used for Mobile and
Remote Access.

If you want to use automated protection on the Expressway-C, you should add exemptions for all hosts that use the automatically
created neighbor zones and the Unified Communications secure traversal zone. The Expressway does not automatically create
exemptions for discovered Unified CM or related nodes.

#### Additional Information

* When a host address is blocked and tries to access the system, the request is dropped (the host receives no response).
* A host address can be blocked simultaneously for multiple categories, but may not necessarily be blocked by all categories.
  Those blocks may also expire at different times.
* When an address is unblocked (either manually or after its block duration expires), it has to fail again for the full number
  of times as specified by the category's trigger level before it will be blocked for a second time by that category.
* A category is reset whenever it is enabled. All categories are reset if the system is restarted or if the automated protection
  service is enabled at the system level. When a category is reset:

  + Any currently blocked addresses are unblocked.
  + Its running totals of failures and blocks are reset to zero.
* You can view all Event Log entries associated with the automated protection service by clicking **View all intrusion protection events** on the Automated detection overview page.
* From X14.0 release:

  + SIP registration failure is enabled by default for new installations and factory reset cases. In case of upgrade scenario,
    the previous value is retained.
  + SIP authentication failure is enabled by default for new installations and factory reset cases. In case of upgrade scenario,
    the pervious value is retained.
  + Disable the SIP authentication failure jail rule on Expressway-C if it is impacting the service.

### Configuring rate limits

The Rate limits overview page (System > Protection > Rate limits  > Configuration) is used to limit SIP traffic rate under which Expressway can perform without any issues like crash, high CPU usage, high
memory usage etc.

From X14.0 release, rate limit is enabled by default for SIP traffic.

1. By default, 100 connections per second are allowed with a burst limit of 20 which come on the SIP ports 5060, 5061, & 5062.
2. You can enable/disable or change number of connections per second and burst limit.
3. Connections per second range value is 1 to 150 and default value is 100.
4. Burst limit range value is 15 to 30 and default value is 20.
5. The bar graph shows number of connections established over the time and number of connections dropped.

| **Important** | ---  * In case of TCP protocol only "NEW" state is considered as new connection. All the related and established connections are treated as same connection, so that   the packets are not dropped from the existing connection. * In case of UDP protocol all the related and established connections as "NEW" connections.  --- |
| --- | --- |

#### **Configuring rate limits rules**

To configure rate limits rules:

1. Go to System > Protection > Rate limits > Configuration
2. Click on the name of the category you want to configure.

   You are taken to the configuration page for that category.
3. Configure the category as required:

   1. Status – whether rate limit mode is enabled or disabled.
   2. Connections (per second) – Change the number of connections per second.
   3. Burst limit – Maximum initial number of connections/packets to match, this number gets recharged by one every time the limit specified
      above is not reached, up to this number.
4. Click Save.

### Configuring System Name and Access Settings

The **System administration** page (System >
Administration) is used to configure the following settings:

* Name of the Cisco Expressway system.
* Methods by which the system may be accessed by administrators. Although you can administer the Expressway through a PC connected
  directly to the unit with a serial cable, you may want to access the system remotely over IP. You can do this using the web
  interface via HTTPS, or through a command line interface via SSH.
* Whether to use FindMe or other provisioning services from the Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Provisioning Extension.
* Optionally direct management traffic for administration services - web user interface, REST API and CLI - to use Expressway's
  Dedicated Management Interface (DMI) on LAN3.

Table 1. Settings for the System Administration page

| Field | Description | Usage Tips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **System name** | Used to identify the Expressway. Appears in various places in the web interface, and in the display on the front panel of the unit (so that you can identify it when it is in a rack with other systems). | We recommend using a name which allows you to easily and uniquely identify the system. |
| **Ephemeral port range** | The **start** and **end** values define the port range to use for ephemeral outbound connections that are not otherwise constrained by Expressway call processing. |  |
| **Services** | | |
| **Serial port / console** | Whether the system can be accessed locally via the VMware console.  Default is *On*. | Serial port / console access is always enabled for one minute following a restart, even if it is normally disabled. |
| **SSH service** | Whether the Expressway can be accessed via SSH and SCP.  Default is *On*. |  |
| **Web interface (over HTTPS)** | Whether the Expressway can be accessed via the web interface.  Default is *On*. |  |
| **Provisioning services** | Whether the System >  TMS Provisioning Extension services page is accessible in the Expressway web user interface. From there you can connect to the Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Provisioning Extension (Cisco TMSPE) and its provisioning services for users, devices, FindMe and phone books.  Default is *Off*. | FindMe is deprecated in Expressway from X12.5 and support will be withdrawn in a subsequent release. |
| **Use Dedicated Management Interface only** | Optionally requires management traffic for administration services - web user interface, REST API and CLI - to use Expressway's Dedicated Management Interface (DMI) on LAN3.  Default is *No*. | The same function is available for SNMP management traffic, from the System >   SNMP page. |
| **Session limits** | | |
| **Session time out** | The number of minutes that an administration session (serial port, HTTPS or SSH) or a FindMe session may be inactive before the session is timed out. Default is 30 minutes. |  |
| **Per-account session limit** | The number of concurrent sessions that each individual administrator account is allowed on each Expressway. | This includes web, SSH and serial sessions. Session limits are not enforced on the root account.  A value of 0 turns session limits off. |
| **System session limit** | The maximum number of concurrent administrator sessions allowed on each Expressway. | This includes web, SSH and serial sessions. Session limits are not enforced on the root account. However active root account sessions do count towards the total number of current administrator sessions.  A value of 0 turns session limits off. |
| **System protection** | | |
| **Automated protection service** | Whether the [automated protection service](#reference_C2F36B56C07F9273A3E3F4BDD1D75348) is active.  Default is *On*. | After enabling the service you need to configure the specific [protection categories](#reference_C2F36B56C07F9273A3E3F4BDD1D75348__section_ehn_hqn_nnb). |
| **Automatic discovery protection** | Controls how management systems such as Cisco TMS can discover this Expressway.  *Off*: Automatic discovery is allowed.  *On*: Cisco TMS must be manually configured to discover this Expressway and must provide administrator account credentials.  Default is *Off*. | Restart the system for any changes to take effect. |
| **Web server configuration** | | |
| **Redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS** | Determines whether HTTP requests are redirected to the HTTPS port.  Default is *Off*. | HTTPS must also be enabled for access via HTTP to function.  When you enter the address without prepending the protocol, your browser assumes HTTP (on port 80). If this setting is *On*, Expressway redirects the browser to the **Web administrator port**. |
| **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)** | Determines whether web browsers are instructed to only ever use a secure connection to access this server. Enabling this feature gives added protection against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.  *On*: The Strict-Transport-Security header is sent with all responses from the web server, with a 1 year expiry time.  *Off*: The Strict-Transport-Security header is not sent, and browsers work as normal.  Default is *On*. | See below for more information about HSTS. |
| **Web administrator port** | Sets the https listening port for administrators to access the Expressway web interface.  We strongly recommend using a non-default port for web administration on the Expressway-E if you enable any features that need TCP 443, eg. Meeting Server Web Proxy.  Restart the Expressway to make this change effective. | If you use a non-default port, and you prepend the `https://` protocol to the address, you must append the port. For example, you would put the address  *https://vcse.example.com:7443* into your browser; if you try *https://vcse.example.com*, the browser assumes port 443 and the Expressway denies access.  Web access to the Expressway could be lost if a network element blocks traffic to the web admin port - you can use SSH or the console to change the port if necessary. |
| **Client certificate-based security** | Controls the level of security required to allow client systems (typically web browsers) to communicate with the Expressway over HTTPS.  *Not required*: The client system does not have to present any form of certificate.  *Certificate validation*: The client system must present a valid certificate that has been signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA).   | **Note** | Restart is required if you are changing from *Not required* to *Certificate validation*. | | --- | --- |   *Certificate-based authentication*: The client system must present a valid certificate that has been signed by a trusted CA and contains the client's authentication credentials.  Default: *Not required* | | **Important** | * *Enabling Certificate validation* means that your browser (the client system) can use the Expressway web interface only if it has a valid (in date and not   revoked by a CRL) client certificate that is signed by a CA in the Expressway's trusted CA certificate list. * Ensure your browser has a valid client certificate before enabling this feature. The procedure for uploading a certificate   to your browser may vary depending on the browser type and you may need to restart your browser for the certificate to take   effect. * You can upload CA certificates on the [Managing the Trusted CA Certificate List](exwy_m_managing-security.html#reference_A54E54BC4D1DB995885958B8D74001BD) page, and test client certificates on the [Testing Client Certificates](exwy_m_managing-security.html#reference_46DC3F5D62B2F0D307EF3ECA524C7797) page. * *Enabling Certificate-based authentication* means that the standard login mechanism is no longer available. You can log in only if your browser certificate is valid   and the credentials it provides have the appropriate authorization levels. You can configure how the Expressway extracts credentials   from the browser certificate on the [Certificate-based Authentication Configuration](exwy_m_managing-security.html#reference_BCD936F444AADC9C4311E0B1820A89AD) page. * This setting does not affect client verification of the Expressway's server certificate. | | --- | --- | |
| **Certificate revocation list (CRL) checking** | Specifies whether HTTPS client certificates are checked against certificate revocation lists (CRLs).  *None*: No CRL checking is performed.  *Peer*: Only the CRL associated with the CA that issued the client's certificate is checked.  *All*: All CRLs in the trusted certificate chain of the CA that issued the client's certificate are checked.  Default: *All* | Only applies if  **Client certificate-based security** is enabled. |
| **CRL inaccessibility fallback behavior** | Controls the revocation checking behavior if the revocation status cannot be established, for example if the revocation source cannot be contacted.   * *Treat as revoked*: Treat the certificate as revoked (and thus do not allow the TLS connection). * *Treat as not revoked*: Treat the certificate as not revoked. * Default: *Treat as not revoked* | Only applies if **Client certificate-based security** is enabled. |
| **Deployment Configuration** | | |
| **Configuration** | Determines the size of the system. The possible options are:  *Large*: 8 CPU cores , 6 GB memory, and 1 Gbps or 10 Gbps NIC.  *Medium*: 2 CPU cores: 4 GB memory, and 1 Gbps NIC. | If you upgrade a *Medium system* with a 1 Gbps NIC, Expressway **automatically converts the appliance to a Large system**. As a result, Expressway-E listens for multiplexed RTP/RTCP traffic on default demultiplexing ports for Large systems (36000 to 36011). In this case, Expressway drops the calls because these ports are not open on the firewall.  If this problem occurs, do either of the following:   * To change the system default size to Medium and use the ports that you have configured for multiplexed RTP/RTCP traffic, select   **Medium**. * If you prefer to use it as Large system, open the default demultiplexing ports for Large systems on the firewall.   This option is available only for CE1200 and later appliances that are deployed as Expressway-Es, and with the following minimum specification:   * Supported Expressway software version (detailed in the *Cisco Expressway CExxxx Installation Guide* for your appliance) * CPU: 8 cores * Memory: 6 GB * NIC: 1 Gbps |

By default, access via HTTPS and SSH is enabled. For optimum security, disable HTTPS and SSH and use the serial port to manage
the system. Because access to the serial port allows the password to be reset, we recommend that you install the Expressway
in a physically secure environment.

* [HTTP Strict Transport Security](#reference_F5EC6AC52793136E2D746683B2D83BF7)

#### HTTP Strict Transport Security

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a mechanism for a web server to force a web browser to communicate with it using
secure connections only. Depending on the version, it may not be supported by all browsers. When HSTS is enabled, a browser
that supports HSTS will:

* Automatically turn any insecure links to the website into secure links before accessing the server(for example, `http://example.com/page/` is modified to `https://example.com/page/`).
* Only allow access to the server if the connection is secure (for example, the server's TLS certificate is valid, trusted,
  and not expired).

Browsers that do not support HSTS ignore the Strict-Transport-Security header and work as before. They will still be able
to access the server.

Compliant browsers only respect Strict-Transport-Security headers if they access the server through its fully qualified name,
rather than its IP address.

### Configuring SNMP Settings

The **SNMP** page (System >
SNMP) is used to configure the Expressway SNMP settings.

Tools such as Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (Cisco TMS) or HP OpenView may act as SNMP Network Management Systems (NMS).
They allow you to monitor your network devices, including the Expressway, for conditions that might require administrative
attention. The Expressway supports the most basic MIB-II tree (.1.3.6.1.2.1) as defined in *[RFC 1213](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1213)*.

The information made available by the Expressway includes:

* System uptime
* System name
* Location
* Contact
* Interfaces
* Disk space, memory, and other machine-specific statistics

SNMP is disabled by default. So to allow the Expressway to be monitored by an SNMP NMS (including Cisco TMS) you need to select
an alternative **SNMP mode**. The configurable options are:

| Field | Description | Usage Tips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **SNMP mode** | Controls the level of SNMP support.  *Disabled*: no SNMP support.  *v3 secure SNMP*: supports authentication and encryption.  *v3 plus TMS support*: secure SNMPv3 plus non-secure access to OID 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 only.  *v2c*: non-secure community-based SNMP. | If you want to use secure SNMPv3 but you also use Cisco TMS as your external manager, you must select *v3 plus TMS support*. |
| **Description** | Custom description of the system as viewed by SNMP. The default is to have no custom description (empty field). | When you leave this field empty, the system uses its default SNMP description. |
| **Community name** | The Expressway's SNMP community name.  The default is *public*. | Only applies when using *v2c* or *v3 plus TMS support*. |
| **System contact** | The name of the person who can be contacted regarding issues with the Expressway.  The default is *Administrator*. | The **System contact** and **Location** are used for reference purposes by administrators when following up on queries. |
| **Location** | Specifies the physical location of the Expressway. |  |
| **Username** | The Expressway's SNMP username, used to identify this SNMP agent to the SNMP manager. | Only applies when using *v3 secure SNMP* or *v3 plus TMS support*. |
| **Use Dedicated Management Interface only** | Optionally requires management traffic for SNMP to use Expressway's Dedicated Management Interface (DMI) on LAN3.  Default is *No*. | The same function is available for management traffic related to administration services - web user interface, REST API, and CLI - from the System >   Administration settings page. |
| **v3 Authentication** settings (only applicable to SNMPv3) | | |
| **Authentication mode** | Enables or disables SNMPv3 authentication. |  |
| **Type** | The algorithm used to hash authentication credentials. From X12.5.7, SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) is the only supported option. MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5) passwords are not supported. |  |
| **Password** | The password used to encrypt authentication credentials. | Must be at least 8 characters. |
| **v3 Privacy** settings (only applicable to SNMPv3) | | |
| **Privacy mode** | Enables or disables SNMPv3 encryption. |  |
| **Type** | The security model used to encrypt messages.  *AES*: Advanced Encryption Standard 128-bit encryption.  The default and recommended setting is  *AES*. |  |
| **Password** | The password used to encrypt messages. | Must be at least 8 characters. |

The Expressway does not support SNMP traps or SNMP sets, therefore it cannot be managed via SNMP.

| **Note** | ---   SNMP is disabled by default, because of the potentially sensitive nature of the information involved. Do not enable SNMP on a Expressway on the public internet or in any other environment where you do not want to expose internal system information.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Configuring Time Settings

The **Time** page (System >
Time) is used to configure the Expressway's NTP servers and to specify the local time zone.

An NTP server is a remote server with which the Expressway synchronizes in order to ensure its time is accurate. The NTP server
provides the Expressway with UTC time.

Accurate time is necessary for correct system operation.

* [Configuring the NTP Servers](#reference_83DAEEB8FE3983A733B2EA6655456530)
* [Expressway Time Display and Time Zone](#concept_BADD76A8AD777C31799F2121B5E4BCB0)

#### Configuring the NTP Servers

To configure the Expressway with one or more NTP servers to be used when synchronizing system time, enter the `Address` of up to five servers in one of the following formats, depending on the system's DNS settings (you can check these settings
on the **DNS** page, System >
DNS):

* If there are no **DNS servers** configured, you must use an IP address for the NTP server
* If there are one or more **DNS servers** configured, you can use an FQDN or IP address for the NTP server
* If there is a DNS **Domain name** configured in addition to one or more **DNS servers**, you can use the server name, FQDN or IP address for the NTP server

Three of the Address fields default to NTP servers provided by Cisco.

You can configure the **Authentication** method used by the Expressway when connecting to an NTP server. Use one of the following options for each NTP server connection:

| Authentication method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *Disabled* | No authentication is used. |
| *Symmetric key* | Symmetric key authentication. When using this method a **Key ID**, **Hash** method and **Pass phrase** must be specified. The values entered here must match exactly the equivalent settings on the NTP server. You can use the same symmetric key settings across multiple NTP servers. However, if you want to configure each server with a different pass phrase, you must also ensure that each server has a unique key ID. |
| *Private key* | Private key authentication. This method uses an automatically generated private key with which to authenticate messages sent to the NTP server. |

##### Displaying NTP status information

The synchronization status between the NTP server and the Expressway is shown in the **Status** area as follows:

* *Starting*: The NTP service is starting.
* *Synchronized*: The Expressway has successfully obtained accurate system time from an NTP server.
* *Unsynchronized*: The Expressway is unable to obtain accurate system time from an NTP server.
* *Down*: The Expressway's NTP client is not running.
* *Reject*: The NTP service is not accepting NTP responses.

| **Note** | ---   Updates may take a few minutes to be displayed in the status table.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Other status information available includes:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **NTP server** | The actual NTP server that has responded to the request. This may be different to the NTP server in the NTP server address field. |
| **Condition** | Gives a relative ranking of each NTP server. All servers that are providing accurate time are given a status of *Candidate*; of those, the server that the Expressway considers to be providing the most accurate time and is therefore using shows a status of *sys.peer*. |
| **Flash** | A code giving information about the server's status. `00 ok` means there are no issues. See the [Flash Status Word Reference Table](exwy_m_reference-material.html#reference_D3E31A8E6B4A2D5F53CF1B246C6A058E) for a complete list of codes. |
| **Authentication** | Indicates the status of the current authentication method. One of  *ok*, *bad* or *none*. *none* is specified when the **Authentication** method is *Disabled*. |
| **Event** | Shows the last event as determined by NTP (for example *reachable* or *sys.peer*) |
| **Reachability** | Indicates the results of the 8 most recent contact attempts between the Expressway and the NTP server, with a tick indicating success and a cross indicating failure. The result of the most recent attempt is shown on the far right.  Each time the NTP configuration is changed, the NTP client is restarted and the Reachability field will revert to all crosses apart from the far right indicator which will show the result of the first connection attempt after the restart. However, the NTP server may have remained contactable during the restart process. |
| **Offset** | The difference between the NTP server's time and the Expressway's time. |
| **Delay** | The network delay between the NTP server and the Expressway. |
| **Stratum** | The degree of separation between the Expressway and a reference clock. `1` indicates that the NTP server is a reference clock. |
| **Ref ID** | A code identifying the reference clock. |
| **Ref time** | The last time that the NTP server communicated with the reference clock. |

For definitions of the remaining fields on this page, and for further information about NTP, see [Network Time Protocol](http://www.ntp.org/) website.

#### Expressway Time Display and Time Zone

Local time is used throughout the web interface. It is shown in the system information bar at the bottom of the screen and
is used to set the timestamp that appears at the start of each line in the Event Log.

| **Note** | ---   UTC timestamps are included at the end of each entry in the Event Log.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Internally, the Expressway maintains its system time in UTC. It is based on the Expressway's operating system time, which
is synchronized using an NTP server if one is configured. If no NTP servers are configured, the Expressway uses its own operating
system time to determine the time and date.

Specifying your local **Time zone** lets the Expressway determine the local time where the system is located. It does this by offsetting UTC time by the number
of hours (or fractions of hours) associated with the selected time zone. It also adjusts the local time to account for summer
time (also known as daylight saving time) when appropriate.

### Configuring the Login Page

Use the **Login page configuration** page (System >
Login page) to specify a message and image to appear on the login page. The **Welcome message title** and **text** appears to administrators when they log in using the CLI or the web interface.

You can upload an image to appear above the welcome message on the login page, in the web interface.

* Supported image file formats are JPG, GIF and PNG.
* Images larger than 200x200 pixels are scaled down.

Optionally you can specify that the welcome message must be acknowledged before the person logging in is allowed to continue.
In this case the system displays an acceptance button, which the user must click to continue.

If the Expressway is using the [TMS Provisioning Extension services](exwy_m_status-and-system-information.html#reference_8C7BAA86451A2105353325042D54C589) to provide FindMe account data, then users log into their FindMe accounts through Cisco TMS, not through Expressway.

| **Note** | ---   This feature is not configurable using the CLI.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Configuring External Manager Settings

The **External Manager** page (System >
External Manager) is used to configure the Expressway connection to an external management system.

An external manager is a remote system, such as the Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (Cisco TMS), used to monitor events
occurring on the Expressway, for example call attempts, connections and disconnections, and as a place for where the Expressway
can send alarm information. The use of an external manager is optional.

| **Note** | ---   Cisco TMS identifies the Expressway as a "TANDBERG VCS".   --- |
| --- | --- |

The Expressway will continue to operate without loss of service if its connection to Cisco TMS fails. This applies even if
the Expressways are clustered. No specific actions are required as the Expressway and Cisco TMS will automatically start communicating
with each other again after the connection is re-established.

| Field | Description | Usage Tips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Address and path** | To use an external manager, you must configure the Expressway with the IP address or host name and path of the external manager to be used. | If you are using Cisco TMS as your external manager, use the default path of  tms/public/external/management/SystemManagementService.asmx |
| **Protocol** | Determines whether communications with the external manager are over *HTTP* or *HTTPS*.  The default is *HTTPS*. |  |
| **Certificate verification mode** | Controls whether the certificate presented by the external manager is verified. | If you enable verification, you must also add the certificate of the issuer of the external manager's certificate to the file containing the Expressway's trusted CA certificates. This is done from the [Managing the Trusted CA Certificate List](exwy_m_managing-security.html#reference_A54E54BC4D1DB995885958B8D74001BD) page (Maintenance >  Security >  Trusted CA certificate). |

## Configuring the Dedicated Management Interface (DMI)

From X12.7, Expressway supports the Dedicated Management Interface (DMI). This is a new network interface that uses the third
LAN port (LAN3) to access Expressway for management-related activities. Instead of sharing a routing interface with other
traffic, management traffic is sent and received through LAN3 and no other traffic uses that port.

The DMI is disabled by default.

| **Note** | ---   If you are using a physical CE1200 appliance, connect **port 3a** (See "Figure 2: Rear view of the Cisco Expressway") provided on your physical appliance and configure the DMI address on it as explained in the chapter "Rear Panel Layout". For specific instructions, see "Cisco Expressway CE1200 Appliance Installation Guide".   --- |
| --- | --- |

* [Introduction to the DMI](#reference_8E9BC4BFCB34F780654EA58A09F0D690)
* [How to Configure the DMI](#task_6B018E11138197D341DDDBB4A13E3386)

### Introduction to the DMI

Enabling the DMI has two aspects:

1. Enabling the DMI function - this switches on the LAN3 port for management traffic. However, it is not exclusive and LAN1 (and
   LAN2 if configured) can also be used - Expressway continues to listen for management traffic on LAN1/LAN2 as well, not just
   on the LAN3 port.
2. If you want LAN3 to be the only interface for management traffic, you need to configure the individual management services
   in Expressway for DMI only.

   | **Note** | ---   If you have management servers outside the LAN3 subnet, currently you also need to configure static IP routes in order for their traffic to be directed to LAN3.   --- |
   | --- | --- |

Expressway management traffic can be classified as server-based or client-based.

Management traffic where Expressway is the server:

* HTTP(S) - for web UI administration and REST API
* ssh - for CLI (not for MRA tunnels)
* SNMP

Management traffic where Expressway is the client, for example:

* HTTP(S) for feedback events to external managers like Cisco TMS
* NTP
* directory (LDAP, Active Directory)
* remote syslog
* system metrics (collectd)

### How to Configure the DMI

**Enable DMI**
#### Before you begin

The new DNS name for the DMI interface must be entered as a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) on the Expressway server certificate.
If an IP address is used to access the interface (or a DNS that is not a SAN entry in the certificate) a certificate validation
warning will be issued and access may be blocked.

| **Caution** | ---   It is essential to properly secure the DMI, as it provides access into the Expressway configuration.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to System >  Network Interfaces >  IP and set **Use Dedicated Management Interface** to *Yes*. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the **LAN3 - DMI** section:   1. Specify the IPv4 and/or IPv6 address of the LAN3 port. 2. For IPv4 also specify the subnet mask. 3. For IPv6 use a static, global address. It cannot be link-local or stateless SLAAC. 4. Optionally change the maximum Ethernet packet size that can be sent over the DMI by setting the **Maximum transmission unit (MTU)** for the port. The default is 1500 bytes. |
| **Step 3** | Restart the system. These changes require a restart to take effect.  The DMI is now activated on LAN3 as an interface for management traffic. If you want the DMI to be the *sole* interface for management, go on to the next tasks.   | **Note** | For Expressway VMs, the OVF template includes a customization option to define the DMI IP address. | | --- | --- | |

---

* [(Optional) Make DMI Sole Interface](#reference_A5F3EA6C26D4BFB2C1C1CC0D11221721)

#### (Optional) Make DMI Sole Interface

##### (Optional) Make DMI sole interface - server management traffic

Use this task to make management traffic use the DMI, where Expressway is the server.

| **Caution** | ---   Before you do this, make sure that the required services are accessible on LAN3, else they won't have access after the change to DMI only. This is especially important for administration services, as the only way to recover them would be to turn off DMI using the console (serial/VMWare).   --- |
| --- | --- |

1. You can do this for administration services (web user interface, REST API, and CLI) and/or for SNMP. Do either or both the
   following steps, depending on which services you want to configure for DMI only:

   * Go to System >
     SNMP and in the **Configuration** section set Use Dedicated Management Interface only to *Yes*.
   * Go to System >
     Administration settings and in the **Services** section set Use Dedicated Management Interface only (for administration) to *Yes*.
2. You need to restart the system for the changes to take effect for the web user interface and the API, which remain accessible
   from LAN1 / LAN2 until you restart. Changes take immediate effect for the command line interface (SSH) and SNMP service, regardless
   of restart.

The specified management services can now be accessed only from the DMI / LAN3 port.

| **Note** | ---   Expressway will not let you disable the DMI while a management service is configured to use it as the only interface.   --- |
| --- | --- |

##### (Optional) Make DMI sole interface - client management traffic outside subnet

For management traffic where Expressway acts as the client, depending on your Expressway version the traffic will only be
directed to the DMI if the target server is in the same subnet as the DMI / LAN3 port. If it's not possible to deploy the
server in the same subnet as LAN3, you can optionally force Expressway management traffic to use the DMI, by configuring static
IP routes for LAN3 per service.

**Example**

This example assumes an Expressway with these subnets:

* LAN3 subnet range: a.b.128.0 - a.b.191.255
* LAN1 subnet range: x.y.156.0 - x.y.159.255

Say you want to configure NTP with Expressway. The NTP server is in the LAN1 subnet. You want outgoing NTP traffic from Expressway
and incoming responses from NTP to use the DMI / LAN3. This can be achieved by creating a static route for LAN3 (System >
 Network interfaces >
Static routes select Add) with the following settings:

* IP address: *x.y.151.0*
* Prefix length: *24*
* Gateway: *172.22.128.1* (gateway of LAN3 subnet)
* Interface: *LAN3*

For more details, see [Static Routes](#reference_237D2BEEDF5895678A345546A9CB3B71).

## Configuring TMS Provisioning Extension Services

Cisco TMSPE services are hosted on Cisco TMS. They provide the user, device, and phone book data used by the Expressway's
[Provisioning Server](exwy_m_applications.html#reference_C75B2E9841B0ED4A5D93BFEAB6C099AF) to service provisioning requests from endpoint devices. They also provide the Expressway with FindMe account configuration
data for FindMe services.

From X8.11, the Cisco TMS-hosted provisioning services are enabled through the  System >
Administration settings page in the web user interface or the device provisioning CLI command (*xconfiguration Administration DeviceProvisoning*). You do not need special option keys or licenses to enable these services. The following device provisioning services are
available:

* Users
* FindMe
* Phone Books
* Devices

For new installations all services are off by default. For existing systems your current service settings are preserved and
remain unchanged after upgrading.

* [Before You Start](#reference_209DB5CCA62B142D4915F2E5685E2B12)
* [Configuration Settings](#reference_E976B6842C5B258F61D7E74DACB98D0A)

### Before You Start

If you have not already done so, go to System >
Administration and set Provisioning services to *On*. Then you can use the System >
TMS Provisioning Extension services page to configure how Expressway connects to Cisco TMSPE services, and which services you want. (To configure the services
themselves, we recommend using the TMS. Changes to Cisco TMSPE service configuration settings made through Expressway **are not applied in TMS**.)

FindMe is a special case. If you enable provisioning services you may see the following configuration warning alarms. If you
plan to use FindMe only, and no other provisioning services, you can ignore these alarms:

* *For phone book requests to work correctly, authentication policy must be enabled on the Default Subzone and any other relevant
  subzone; authentication must also be enabled on the Default Zone if the endpoints are not registered.*
* *For provisioning to work correctly, authentication policy must be enabled on the Default Zone and any other relevant zone
  that receives provisioning requests.*

### Configuration Settings

The configurable options for provisioning services are described in the table:

Table 2. Configurable Options for Provisioning Services

| Field | Description | Usage Tips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Default connection configuration**  This section specifies default connection settings for accessing Cisco TMSPE services. Each service can choose to use these settings, or specify its own connection settings (for example, if a different Cisco TMSPE server is in use per service). | | |
| **Server address** | The IP address or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the service. |  |
| **Destination port** | The listening port on the Cisco TMSPE service. |  |
| **Encryption** | The encryption to connect the Cisco TMSPE service. For more information see [Configuring Minimum TLS Version and Cipher Suites.](exwy_m_managing-security.html#reference_2CD01278669B0E2ED4633003848711B2)  *Off*: No encryption.  *TLS*: Provides TLS encryption.  Default is *TLS*. | A TLS connection is recommended. |
| **Verify certificate** | Controls whether the certificate presented by the Cisco TMSPE service is verified against the Expressway's current trusted CA list and (if any) revocation list.  Default is *Yes*. | If verification is enabled:   * IIS (on the Cisco TMSPE server) must be installed with a signed certificate and be set to enforce SSL connections. * You must add the certificate of the issuer of the Cisco TMSPE server's certificate to the file containing the Expressway's   trusted CA certificates. Do this from the [Managing the Trusted CA Certificate List](exwy_m_managing-security.html#reference_A54E54BC4D1DB995885958B8D74001BD) page (Maintenance >    Security >    Trusted CA certificate). |
| **Check certificate hostname** | Controls whether the hostname contained within the certificate presented by the Cisco TMSPE service is verified by the Expressway.  Default is *Yes*. | Applies if **Verify certificate** is *Yes*.  If enabled, the certificate hostname (the Common Name) must match the specified **Server address**. If the server address is an IP address, the required hostname is obtained through a DNS lookup. |
| **Base group** | The ID used to identify this Expressway (or Expressway cluster) with the Cisco TMSPE service. | The TMS administrator will supply this value.  The **Base group** ID used by the **Devices** service must be explicitly specified as it is normally different from that used by the other services. |
| **Authentication username** and **password** | The username and corresponding password used by the Expressway to authenticate itself with the Cisco TMSPE service. | If TLS encryption is not enabled, the authentication password is sent in the clear. |
| **Service-specific configuration**  You can specify the connection details for each of the Cisco TMSPE services: **Users**, **FindMe**, **Phone books**, and **Devices**. | | |
| **Connect to this service** | Controls whether the Expressway connects to the Cisco TMSPE service.  Default is *No*. | If *Yes*, the status of an enabled connection is shown next to the field: *Checking*, *Active* or *Failed*. (Click [details](exwy_m_status-and-system-information.html#reference_8C7BAA86451A2105353325042D54C589) to view full status information.) |
| **Polling interval** | The frequency with which the Expressway checks the Cisco TMSPE service for updates. Defaults are:  **FindMe**: *2 minutes*  **Users**: *2 minutes*  **Phone books**: *1 day*  The **Device** service polling interval is set to 30 seconds and cannot be modified. | You can request an immediate update of all services by clicking Check for updates at the bottom of the page. |
| **Use the default connection configuration** | Controls whether the service uses the default connection configuration for Cisco TMSPE services.  Default is *Yes*. | If *No*, an additional set of connection configuration parameters appears. There you can specify alternative connection details, to override the default connection settings for the service. |

You can do an immediate resynchronization of data between Expressway and Cisco TMS at any time by clicking Perform full synchronization on the  **TMS Provisioning Extension services** page. This will result in a few seconds lack of service on the Expressway while data is deleted and refreshed. If you only
need to apply recent updates in Cisco TMS to the Expressway, click Check for updates instead.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |

| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

# Network and System Settings

This section describes network services and settings related options that appear under the **System** menu of the web interface. These options enable you to configure the Expressway in relation to the network in which it is
located, for example its IP settings, firewall rules, intrusion protection and the external services used by the Expressway
(for example DNS, NTP and SNMP).

### Ethernet Settings

| **Note** | ---   The speed settings on this page are for systems running on Cisco Expressway physical appliances only. They do not apply to virtual machine (VM)-based systems. The connection speed shown for VM systems is invalid, and always appears as 10000 Mb/s regardless of the actual speed of the underlying physical NIC(s). This is because VMs cannot retrieve the actual speed from the physical NIC.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The **Ethernet** page (System >
Network interfaces >
Ethernet) displays the connection speeds between Expressway and the Ethernet networks to which it is connected. As the Expressway
only supports auto-negotiation, the **Speed** is always *Auto*. The Expressway and the connected switch automatically negotiate the speed and the duplex mode for the connection.

### Configuring IP Settings

The **IP** page (System >
Network interfaces >
IP) is used to configure the IP protocols and network interface settings of the Expressway.

#### IP Protocol Configuration

You can configure whether the Expressway uses IPv4, IPv6, or both versions of the IP protocol suite. The default is *Both*.

* *IPv4 only*: it only accepts registrations from endpoints using an IPv4 address, and only takes calls between two endpoints communicating
  via IPv4. It communicates with other systems via IPv4 only.
* *IPv6 only*: it only accepts registrations from endpoints using an IPv6 address, and only takes calls between two endpoints communicating
  via IPv6. It communicates with other systems via IPv6 only.
* *Both*: it accepts registrations from endpoints using either an IPv4 or IPv6 address, and takes calls using either protocol. If
  a call is between an IPv4-only and an IPv6-only endpoint, the Expressway acts as an IPv4 to IPv6 gateway. It communicates
  with other systems via either protocol.

Some endpoints support both IPv4 and IPv6, however an endpoint can use only one protocol when registering with the Expressway.
Which protocol it uses is determined by the format used to specify the IP address of the Expressway on the endpoint. After
the endpoint has registered using either IPv4 or IPv6, the Expressway only sends calls to it using this addressing scheme.
Calls made to that endpoint from another device using the other addressing scheme are converted (gatewayed) by the Expressway.

All IPv6 addresses configured on the Expressway are treated as having a /64 network prefix length.

#### IPv4 to IPv6 Interworking

The Expressway can act as a gateway for calls between IPv4 and IPv6 devices. To enable this feature, select an **IP protocol** of *Both*. Calls for which the Expressway is acting as an IPv4 to IPv6 gateway are traversal calls and require a Rich Media Session
license.

#### IP Gateways

You can set the default **IPv4 gateway** and **IPv6 gateway** used by the Expressway. These are the gateways to which IP requests are sent for IP addresses that do not fall within the
Expressway’s local subnet.

* The default **IPv4 gateway** is 127.0.0.1, which should be changed during the commissioning process.
* The **IPv6 gateway**, if entered, must be a static global IPv6 address. It cannot be a link-local or a stateless auto-configuration (SLAAC) IPv6
  address.

#### LAN Configuration

LAN 1 is the primary network port on the Expressway. You can configure the **IPv4 address and subnet mask**, the **IPv6 address** and the **Maximum transmission unit (MTU)** for this port. The Expressway is shipped with a default IP address of 192.168.0.100 (for both LAN ports). This lets you connect
the Expressway to your network and access it via the default address so that you can configure it remotely.

The **IPv6 address**, if entered, must be a static global IPv6 address. It cannot be a link-local or stateless auto-configuration (SLAAC) address.

The **Maximum transmission unit (MTU)** defaults to 1500 bytes.

If you have **Advanced Networking** enabled, you can also configure these options for the LAN 2 port.

#### Dedicated Management Interface

If you want to enable the Expressway's DMI:

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Set **Use Dedicated Management Interface** to *Yes*. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the **LAN3 - DMI** section:   1. Specify the IPv4 and/or IPv6 address of the LAN3 port. 2. For IPv4 also specify the subnet mask. 3. For IPv6 use a static, global address. It cannot be link-local or stateless SLAAC. 4. Optionally change the maximum Ethernet packet size that can be sent over the DMI by setting the **Maximum transmission unit (MTU)** for the port. The default is 1500 bytes. |
| **Step 3** | Restart the system. These changes require a restart to take effect.  The DMI is now activated on LAN3 as an interface for management traffic. If you want the DMI to be the *sole* interface for management, go on to the next tasks. |

---

##### What to do next

[(Optional) Make DMI Sole Interface](#reference_5F3C968EEAA4316F65F3DE2BDE5CD76C)

* [Make DMI Sole Interface](#reference_5F3C968EEAA4316F65F3DE2BDE5CD76C)

##### Make DMI Sole Interface

###### (Optional) Make DMI Sole Interface - Server Management Traffic

Use this task to make management traffic use the DMI, where Expressway is the server.

1. You can do this for administration services (web user interface, REST API, and CLI) and/or for SNMP. Do either or both the
   following steps, depending on which services you want to configure for DMI only:

   * Go to the System >
     SNMP page and in the **Configuration** section set **Use Dedicated Management Interface** only to *Yes*.
   * Go to the System >
     Administration settings page and in the **Services** section set **Use Dedicated Management Interface only (for administration)** to *Yes*.
2. You need to restart the system for the changes to take effect for the web user interface and the API, which remain accessible
   from LAN1 / LAN2 until you restart. Changes take immediate effect for the command line interface (SSH) and SNMP service, regardless
   of restart.

The specified management services can now be accessed only from the DMI / LAN3 port.

| **Note** | ---   Expressway will not let you disable the DMI while a management service is configured to use it as the only interface.   --- |
| --- | --- |

###### (Optional) Make DMI Sole Interface - Client Management Traffic Outside Subnet

Depending on the Expressway software version, for management traffic where Expressway acts as the client, the traffic may
only be directed to the DMI if the target server is in the same subnet as the DMI / LAN3 port. Check your release notes to
see if this issue applies. If it does, and if it's not possible to deploy the server in the same subnet as LAN3, you can optionally
force Expressway management traffic to use the DMI, by configuring static IP routes for LAN3 per service.

#### About Advanced Networking and Dual Network Interfaces

The Advanced Networking feature enables the LAN 2 Ethernet port on the Expressway-E, to allow a secondary IP address for the
Expressway. It also includes support for deployments where the Expressway-E is located behind a static NAT device, allowing
it to have separate public and private IP addresses.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/400001-500000/450001-460000/454001-455000/454322.jpg)

#### Configuring Dual Network Interfaces

Dual network interfaces are **only supported on Expressway-E** systems; you cannot deploy them on an Expressway-C.

Dual network interfaces are intended for deployments where the Expressway-E is located in a DMZ between two separate firewalls
on separate network segments. In such deployments, routers prevent devices on the internal network from being able to route
IP traffic to the public internet, and instead the traffic must pass through an application proxy such as the Expressway-E.

* [To enable dual network interfaces](#task_45602B3A7EFF15326359A1ECBB7905A1)

##### To enable dual network interfaces

###### Before you begin

* Configure the LAN 1 port and restart the Expressway before you configure the LAN 2 port.
* The LAN 1 and LAN 2 interfaces must be on different, non-overlapping subnets.
* If the Expressway-E is in the DMZ, the outside IP address of the Expressway-E must be a public IP address, or if static NAT
  mode is enabled, the static NAT address must be publicly accessible.
* The Expressway-E may also be used to traverse internal firewalls within an enterprise. In this case the "public" IP address may not be publicly accessible, but is an IP address accessible to other parts of the enterprise.
* If you need to change the IP addresses on one or both interfaces, you can do it via the UI or the CLI. You can change both
  at the same time if required, and the new addresses take effect after a restart.

###### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Set **Use dual network interfaces** to *Yes*. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Select *LAN2* as the interface in the **External LAN interface** setting.  You can now choose to enable static NAT on the external interface. This setting also determines which port allocates TURN server relays.  Troubleshooting Tips:If you have Advanced Networking enabled but only want to configure one of the Ethernet ports, switch **Use dual network interfaces** to *No* |

---

#### Configuring Static NAT

You can deploy the Expressway-E behind a static NAT device, allowing it to have separate public and private IP addresses.
This feature is intended for use in deployments where the Expressway-E is located in a DMZ, and has the **Advanced Networking** feature enabled.

In these deployments, the externally-facing LAN port has static NAT enabled in order to use both a private and public IPv4
address. The internally facing LAN port does not have static NAT enabled and uses a single IP address. In such a deployment,
traversal clients should be configured to use the internally-facing IP address of the Expressway-E.

* [To enable static NAT](#task_F88DC26B8E5FAF630BC9DFE812C0937A)

##### To enable static NAT

For the externally-facing LAN port, specify the following settings:
###### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the **IPv4 address** field, enter the private IP address of the port. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Set **IPv4 static NAT mode** to *On*. |
| **Step 3** | In the **IPv4 static NAT address** field, enter the public IP address of the port - the IP address as it appears after translation (outside the NAT element). |

---

### IPv6 Mode Features and Limitations

When you set the IP interfaces of the Expressway to *IPv6 Only* mode, those interfaces only use IPv6. They do not use IPv4 to communicate with other systems, and they do not interwork between
IPv4 and IPv6 (Dual stack).

#### Explicit IPv6 Supported Features

* Calls between Expressway-registered IPv6 endpoints.
* DiffServ traffic class (TC) tagging.
* TURN server (on Expressway-E).
* Automated intrusion protection.
* DNS lookups.
* Port usage and status pages.

#### Supported RFCs

* RFC 2460: Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification (partially implemented: static global addresses only).
* RFC 2464: Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks.
* RFC 3596: DNS Extensions to Support IP Version 6.
* RFC 4213: Basic Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers.
* RFC 4291: IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture.
* RFC 4443: Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6) for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Specification.

* RFC 5095: Deprecation of Type 0 Routing Headers in IPv6.
* RFC 6156: Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) Extension for IPv6.

#### Known Limitations in IPv6 Mode

* IPv6 addresses must be static; they cannot be link-local or SLAAC addresses.
* You must restart the Expressway when you change its IP address or its gateway's IP address.
* Mobile and Remote Access (MRA) is not tested or supported in IPv6 mode. For MRA, the primary call control agent is Unified
  CM which does not support IPv6.
* Getting revocation status from distributed Certificate Revocation Lists is not supported in IPv6 mode.

### Configuring DNS Settings

The **DNS** page (System >
DNS) is used to configure DNS servers and DNS settings on the Expressway.

* [Configuring the System Host Name and Domain Name](#reference_3DC581E69F60CB5A1BE6AD9D664D3601)
* [Configuring DNS Server Addresses](#reference_55F8466EABB9FC422550EBEE4E02C8AF)
* [Caching DNS Records](#concept_33EDFE4A081BD207C16287CCD38DB08D)

#### Configuring the System Host Name and Domain Name

The **System host name** defines the DNS host name that this Expressway is known by.

* It must be unique for each peer in a cluster.
* It is used to identify the Expressway on a remote log server (a default name of "TANDBERG" is used if the **System host name** is not specified).
* It must contain only letters, digits, hyphens, and underscore. The first character must be a letter, and the last character
  must be a letter or a digit.

The **Domain name** is used when attempting to resolve unqualified server addresses (for example, ldapserver). It's appended to the unqualified server address before the query is sent to the DNS server. If the server address is fully
qualified (for example, ldapserver.mydomain.com) or is in the form of an IP address, the domain name is not appended to the server address before querying the DNS server.
The domain name applies to the following Expressway configuration settings:

* LDAP server
* NTP server
* External Manager server
* Remote logging server

We recommend using an IP address or FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) for all server addresses (The FQDN of the Expressway
is the **System host name** plus the **Domain name**.)

##### Impact on SIP messaging

The **System host name** and **Domain name** are also used to identify references to this Expressway in SIP messaging, where an endpoint has configured the Expressway
as its SIP proxy in the form of an FQDN (as opposed to an IP address, which is not recommended).

In this case the Expressway may, for example, reject an INVITE request if the FQDN configured on the endpoint does not match
the **System host name** and **Domain name** configured on the Expressway.

| **Note** | ---   This check occurs because the SIP proxy FQDN is included in the route header of the SIP request sent by the endpoint to the Expressway.   --- |
| --- | --- |

##### Custom domain searches

The **Search domains** setting is relevant for Edge deployments where the external hosts are in a different DNS domain from Expressway-C, and are
configured with non-qualified hostnames. You can optionally use this setting to specify one or more DNS domains. The Expressway
appends these domains one by one, to the unqualified hostname and queries DNS for the resultant FQDN. It repeats this process
until DNS returns an IP address. This means that there's no need to enter FQDNs when configuring connections between hosts.

Use a space to separate multiple addresses.

##### DNS requests

By default, DNS requests use a random port from within the system's ephemeral port range. If required, you can specify a custom
port range instead by setting **DNS requests port range** to *Use a custom port range* and then defining the **DNS requests port range start** and **DNS requests port range end** fields.

| **Note** | ---   Setting a small source port range will increase your vulnerability to DNS spoofing attacks.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Configuring DNS Server Addresses

You must specify at least one DNS server to be queried for address resolution if you want to use the following:

* FQDNs instead of IP addresses when specifying external addresses (for example, for LDAP and NTP servers, neighbor zones, and
  peers).
* Features like [URI Dialing](exwy_m_dial-plan-and-call-processing.html#concept_5BB8855CD118F54B4D69AA68B0AD26E0) or [ENUM Dialing](exwy_m_dial-plan-and-call-processing.html#concept_F57BAE133686D54315C67A3493E9C9FE).

##### Default DNS servers

You can specify up to five default DNS servers. The Expressway only queries one server at a time. If that server is unavailable
the Expressway tries another server from the list.

The order that the servers are specified is not significant. The Expressway favors servers that were last known to be available.

##### Per-domain DNS servers

As well as the five default DNS servers, you can specify up to five additional explicit DNS servers for specified domains.
This can be useful in deployments where specific domain hierarchies need to be routed to their explicit authorities.

For each additional per-domain DNS server address you can specify up to two  **Domain names**. Any DNS queries under those domains are forwarded to the specified DNS server instead of the default DNS servers.

To specify redundant per-domain servers, add an additional per-domain DNS server address and associate it with the same **Domain names**. DNS requests for those domains are sent in parallel to both DNS servers.

You can use the [DNS lookup](exwy_m_diagnostics-and-troubleshooting.html#reference_C0EC17D684FB8EC69A86636D14E0537B) tool (Maintenance >
Tools >
Network utilities >
DNS lookup) to check which domain name server (DNS server) is responding to a request for a particular hostname.

##### Transport protocols

The Expressway uses UDP and TCP to do DNS resolution, and DNS servers usually send both UDP and TCP responses. If the UDP
response exceeds the UDP message size limit of 512 bytes, then the Expressway cannot process the UDP response. This is not
usually a problem, because the Expressway can process the TCP response instead.

However, if you block TCP inbound on port 53, and if the UDP response is greater than 512 bytes, then the Expressway cannot
process the response from the DNS. In this case you won't see the results using the DNS lookup tool, and any operations that
need the requested addresses will fail.

#### Caching DNS Records

DNS lookups may be cached to improve performance. The cache is flushed automatically whenever the DNS configuration is changed,
and you can optionally force a flush by clicking Flush DNS cache.

### Configuring DSCP / Quality of Service Settings

* [About DSCP Marking](#reference_F787B71355AE4C44CDE2D8A359FBB051)
* [Configuring DSCP Values](#concept_D645BF0D2D1E84C34D39B60A5C0FDC75)

#### About DSCP Marking

From X8.9, the Expressway supports improved DSCP (Differentiated Service Code Point) packet marking for traffic passing through
the firewall, including Mobile and Remote Access. DSCP is a measure of the Quality of Service level of the packet. To provide
more granular control of traffic prioritization, DSCP values are set (marked) for these individual traffic types:

| Traffic type | Supplied default value | Web UI field |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Video | 34 | QoS Video |
| Audio | 46 | QoS Audio |
| XMPP | 24 | QoS XMPP |
| Signaling | 24 | QoS Signaling |

Before X8.9 you had to apply DSCP values to all signaling and media traffic collectively.

You can optionally change the default DSCP values from the System >
Quality of Service web UI page (or the CLI).

##### Notes:

* DSCP value "0" specifies standard best-effort service.
* DSCP marking is applied to SIP and H.323 traffic.
* DSCP marking is applied to TURN media, providing the TURN traffic is actually handled by the Expressway.
* Traffic type "Video" is assigned by default if the media type cannot be identified. (For example, if different media types are multiplexed on
  the same port.)

##### Existing QoS/DSCP Commands and API are Discontinued

| **Note** | ---   From X8.9 we no longer support the previous methods to specify QoS/DSCP values. The former Web UI settings QoS Mode and QoS Value, CLI commands `xConfiguration IP QoS Mode` and `xConfiguration IP QoS Value` and corresponding API are now discontinued. Do not use these commands.   --- |
| --- | --- |

##### What if I currently use these commands?

When you upgrade the Expressway, any existing QoS value you have defined is automatically applied to the new fields and replaces
the supplied defaults. For example, if you had a value of 20 defined, all four DSCP settings (QoS Audio, QoS Video, QoS XMPP,
QoS Signaling) are set to 20 also.

We don't support downgrades. If you need to revert to your pre-upgrade software version, the QoS settings are reset to their
original supplied defaults. So QoS Mode is set to None and QoS Value is set to 0. You will need to manually redefine the values
you want to use.

#### Configuring DSCP Values

To optionally change the supplied DSCP default values, go to the Quality of Service page (System >
Quality of Service) and specify the new values you want to use.

### Static Routes

You can define static routes from the Expressway to an IPv4 or IPv6 address range. Go to System >
Network interfaces >
Static routes.

On this page you can view, add, and delete static routes.

Static routes are sometimes required when using the **Advanced Networking** option and deploying the Expressway in a DMZ. They may also be required in other complex network deployments.

* [To add a static route:](#task_5DE3A501613D9572E12B86E779138123)

#### To add a static route:

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Enter the base destination address of the new static route from this Expressway.  For example, enter `203.0.113.0 or 2001:db8::` |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Enter the prefix length that defines the range.  Extending the example, you could enter `24` to define the IPv4 range 203.0.113.0 - 203.0.113.255, or `32` to define the IPv6 range 2001:db8:: to 2001:db8:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff.  The address range field shows the range calculated by the Expressway from the IP address and Prefix length. |
| **Step 3** | Enter the IP address of the gateway for your new route. |
| **Step 4** | Select an ethernet interface for your new route.  This option is only available if the second ethernet interface is enabled. Select *LAN 1* or *LAN 2* to force the route via that interface, or select  *Auto* to allow the Expressway to make this route on either interface. |
| **Step 5** | Click Create route.  The new static route is listed in the table. You can delete routes from this table if necessary.   | **Note** | * IP routes can also be configured using the CLI, using  [xCommand RouteAdd](exwy_m_reference-material.html#reference_BFDAA3467CD49A9CE98E1A8A91D43878__) and the [xConfiguration IP Route](exwy_m_reference-material.html#reference_D1AB5A49A289A65A0AE1A7C0761C455C__) commands. * You can configure routes for up to 50 network and host combinations. * Do not configure IP routes by logging in as `root` and using `ip route` statements. | | --- | --- | |

* [Configuring rate limits](#reference_A17BB2CD899622AEA310351B14CA7E50)

### Configuring Firewall Rules

Firewall rules provide the ability to configure IP table rules to control access to the Expressway at the IP level. On the
Expressway, these rules have been classified into groups and are applied in the following order:

* **Dynamic system rules**: these rules ensure that all established connections/sessions are maintained. They also include any rules that have been
  inserted by the automated detection feature as it blocks specific addresses. Finally, it includes a rule to allow access from
  the loopback interface.
* **Non-configurable application rules**: this incorporates all necessary application-specific rules, for example to allow SNMP traffic and H.323 gatekeeper discovery.
* **User-configurable rules**: this incorporates all of the manually configured firewall rules (as described in this section) that refine — and typically
  restrict — what can access the Expressway. There is a final rule in this group that allows all traffic destined for the Expressway
  LAN 1 interface (and the LAN 2 interface if the  **Advanced Networking** option key is installed).

There is also a final, non-configurable rule that drops any broadcast or multicast traffic that has not already been specifically
allowed or denied by the previous rules.

By default any traffic that is destined for the specific IP address of the Expressway is allowed access, but that traffic
will be dropped if the Expressway is not explicitly listening for it. You have to actively configure extra rules to lock down
the system to your specifications.

| **Note** | ---   Return traffic from outbound connections is always accepted.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### User-configured rules

The user-configured rules are typically used to restrict what can access the Expressway. You can:

* Specify the source IP address subnet from which to allow or deny traffic.
* Choose whether to drop or reject denied traffic.

  For certain scenarios, even if there is a firewall rule to drop or reject certain inbound traffic, the Expressway still proxies
  the traffic. This is because firewall rules apply only to new inbound traffic. If the device on the internal network initiates
  the outbound connection, the device on the external network uses the same ports to response. It takes high priority than the
  firewall rules since the IP table contains the existing media path information.
* Configure well known services such as SSH, HTTP/HTTPS or specify customized rules based on transport protocols and port ranges.
* Configure different rules for the LAN 1 and LAN 2 interfaces (if the  **Advanced Networking** option key is installed), although note that you cannot configure specific destination addresses such as a multicast address.
* Specify the priority order in which the rules are applied.

* [Setting Up and Activating Firewall Rules](#concept_2EB69543CD4A2D9FA467C629C6ECFF1B)
* [Rule settings](#concept_5F13545F7DB866A03A322D1FD5AB1404)

#### Setting Up and Activating Firewall Rules

Use the **Firewall rules configuration** page to set up and activate a new set of firewall rules.

The set of rules shown is initially a copy of the current active rules. (On a system where no firewall rules have been defined,
the list is empty.) If you have a lot of rules you can use the Filter options to limit the set of rules displayed.

| **Note** | ---   The built-in rules are not shown in this list.   --- |
| --- | --- |

You can change the set of firewall rules by adding new rules, or by modifying or deleting existing ones. Changes to the current
active rules are held in a pending state. When you finish making changes, you activate the new rules to replace the previous
set. For UDP-related rules, note that new rules only take effect at the next system reboot (although if you delete UDP rules,
they become inactive as soon as you activate the rule set).

* [To configure and activate rules:](#task_5E8792B0F2FD55DD1EF876885A671C18)

##### To configure and activate rules:

###### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to System >  Protection >  Firewall rules >  Configuration. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Make your changes by adding, modifying, or deleting rules as required.  To change the order of the rules, use the up/down arrows  and  to swap the priorities of adjacent rules.   * New or modified rules are shown as **Pending** (in the **State** column). * Deleted rules are shown as **Pending delete**. |
| **Step 3** | When you finish configuring the new set of firewall rules, click Activate firewall rules. |
| **Step 4** | Confirm that you want to activate the new rules. This will replace the existing set of active rules with the set you have just configured.  After confirming that you want to activate the new rules, they are validated and any errors reported. |
| **Step 5** | If there are no errors, the new rules are temporarily activated and you are taken to the Firewall rules confirmation page.  You now have 15 seconds to confirm that you want to keep the new rules:   * Click Accept changes to permanently apply the rules. * If the 15 seconds time limit expires or you click Rollback changes, the previous rules are reinstated and you are taken back to the configuration page.  The automatic rollback mechanism provided by the 15 seconds time limit ensures that the client system that activated the changes   is still able to access the system after the new rules have been applied. If the client system is unable to confirm the changes   (because it can no longer access the web interface) then the rollback will ensure that its ability to access the system is   reinstated. |
| **Step 6** | This step only applies if you add UDP rules. That is, one or more custom rules with **Transport=***UDP*. New UDP rules do not take effect until the next system reboot. In this special case, activating the firewall rules is not sufficient by itself. Deleted UDP rules do not have this requirement, and become inactive as soon as you activate the rule set.  When configuring firewall rules, you also have the option to Revert all changes. This discards all pending changes and resets the working copy of the rules to match the current active rules. |

---

#### Rule settings

The configurable options for each rule are:

| Field | Description | Usage tips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Priority** | The order in which the firewall rules are applied. | The rules with the highest priority (1, then 2, then 3 and so on) are applied first.  Firewall rules must have unique priorities. Rule activation will fail if there are multiple rules with the same priority. |
| **Interface** | The LAN interface on which you want to control access. | This only applies if the Advanced Networking option key is installed. |
| **IP address** and **Prefix length** | These two fields together determine the range of IP addresses to which the rule applies. | The Address range field shows the range of IP addresses to which the rule applies, based on the combination of the **IP address** and **Prefix length**.  The prefix length range is 0-32 for an IPv4 address, and 0-128 for an IPv6 address. |
| **Service** | Choose the service to which the rule applies, or choose *Custom* to specify your own transport type and port ranges. | | **Note** | If the destination port of a service is subsequently reconfigured on the Expressway, for example from 80 to 8080, any firewall rules containing the old port number will not be automatically updated. | | --- | --- | |
| **Transport** | The transport protocol to which the rule applies. | Only applies if specifying a *Custom* service. |
| **Start and end port** | The port range to which the rule applies. | Only applies if specifying a UDP or TCP *Custom* service. |
| **Action** | The action to take against any IP traffic that matches the rule.  *Allow*: Accept the traffic.  *Drop:* Drop the traffic without any response to the sender.  *Reject:* Reject the traffic with an "unreachable" response. | Dropping the traffic means that potential attackers are not provided with information as to which device is filtering the packets or why.  For deployments in a secure environment, you may want to configure a set of low priority rules (for example, priority 50000) that deny access to all services and then configure higher priority rules (for example, priority 20) that selectively allow access for specific IP addresses. |
| **Description** | An optional free-form description of the firewall rule. | If you have a lot of rules you can use the  **Filter** by description options to find related sets of rules. |

### Current Active Firewall Rules

The **Current active firewall rules** page (System >
Protection >
Firewall rules >
Current active rules) shows the user-configured firewall rules that are currently in place on the system. There is also a set of built-in rules
that are not shown in this list.

If you want to change the rules you must go to the **Firewall rules configuration** page from where you can set up and activate a new set of rules.

### Configuring Automated Intrusion Protection

You can use the automated protection service to detect and block malicious traffic and to help protect the Expressway from
dictionary-based attempts to breach login security.

It works by parsing the system log files to detect repeated failures to access specific service categories, such as SIP, SSH
and web/HTTPS access. When the number of failures within a specified time window reaches the configured threshold, the source
host address (the intruder) and destination port are blocked for a specified period of time. The host address is automatically
unblocked after that time period so as not to lock out any genuine hosts that may have been temporarily misconfigured.

You can configure ranges of addresses that are exempted from one or more categories (see [Configuring Exemptions](#task_EC6F7755258E5349E2A05F76ADD82F7D)).

You should use automated protection in combination with [firewall rules](#reference_44F337305232FA0214D2CD1B2BCCEFFF); automated protection to dynamically detect and temporarily block specific threats, and firewall rules to permanently block
a range of known host addresses.

#### About Protection Categories

The set of available protection categories on your Expressway are pre-configured according to the software version that is
running. You can enable, disable or configure each category, but you cannot add new categories.

The rules which associate specific log file messages with each category are also pre-configured and you cannot change them.
You can view example log file entries that would be treated as an access failure/intrusion within a particular category by
going to System >
Protection >
 Automated detection >
Configuration and clicking on the name of the category. The examples are displayed above the **Status** section at the bottom of the page.

#### Enabling Automated Protection

From X8.9, automated intrusion protection is enabled by default for various categories, including the following:

* HTTP proxy authentication failure
* HTTP proxy protocol violation
* SSH authorization failure
* SSH protocol violation
* XMPP protocol violation

This change affects new systems. Upgraded systems keep their existing protection configuration.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to System >   Administration. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Set **Automated protection service** to *On*. |
| **Step 3** | Click Save.  The service is running now, but you must configure the protection categories and any exemptions necessary for your environment. |

---

#### Configuring Protection Categories

The Automated detection overview page (System >
Protection >
Automated detection >
Configuration) is used to enable and configure the Expressway's protection categories, and to view current activity.

The page displays a summary of all available categories, showing:

* **Status**: This indicates if the category is configured to be *On* or *Off*. When *On*, it additionally indicates the state of the category: this is normally *Active*, but may temporarily display *Initializing* or *Shutting down* when a category has just been enabled or disabled. Check the alarms if it displays *Failed*.)
* **Currently blocked**: The number of addresses currently being blocked for this category.
* **Total failures**: The total number of failed attempts to access the services associated with this category.
* **Total blocks**: The total number of times that a block has been triggered.

  | **Note** | ---  + The **Total blocks** will typically be less than the **Total failures** (unless the **Trigger level** is set to 1). + The same address can be blocked and released several times per category, with each occurrence counting as a separate block.  --- |
  | --- | --- |
* **Exemptions**: The number of addresses that are configured as exempt from this category.

From this page, you can also view any currently blocked addresses or any exemptions that apply to a particular category.

* [Enabling or Disabling Categories](#task_2DF575CB179365EDDEC45B02072A5A36)
* [Configuring a Category's Blocking Rules](#task_2833CB6133B10DE963FABDFD158E9377)

##### Enabling or Disabling Categories

###### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to System >  Protection >  Automated detection >  Configuration. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Select the check box alongside the categories you want to enable or disable. |
| **Step 3** | Click Enable or Disable as appropriate. |

---

##### Configuring a Category's Blocking Rules

###### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to System >  Protection >  Automated detection >  Configuration. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click on the name of the category you want to configure. You are taken to the configuration page for that category. |
| **Step 3** | Configure the category as required:   * **State**: Whether protection for that category is enabled or disabled. * **Description**: A free-form description of the category. * **Trigger level and Detection window**: These settings combine to define the blocking threshold for the category. They specify the number of failed access attempts   that must occur before the block is triggered, and the time window in which those failures must occur. * **Block duration**: The period of time for which the block will remain in place. |
| **Step 4** | Click Save. |

---

#### Configuring Exemptions

The Automated detection exemptions page (System >
Protection >
Automated detection >
Exemptions) is used to configure any IP addresses that are to be exempted always from one or more protection categories.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to System >  Protection >  Automated detection >  Exemptions. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click on the Address you want to configure, or click New to specify a new address. |
| **Step 3** | Enter the `Address` and `Prefix length` to define the range of IP addresses you want to exempt. |
| **Step 4** | Select the categories from which the address is to be exempted. |
| **Step 5** | Click Add address.   | **Note** | If you exempt an address that is currently blocked, it will remain blocked until its block duration expires (unless you unblock it manually via the **Blocked addresses** page). | | --- | --- | |

---

#### Managing Blocked Addresses

The **Blocked addresses** page (System >
Protection >
Automated detection >
Blocked addresses) is used to manage the addresses that are currently blocked by the automated protection service:

* It shows all currently blocked addresses and from which categories those addresses have been blocked.
* You can unblock an address, or unblock an address and at the same time add it to the exemption list. Note that if you want
  to permanently block an address, you must add it to the set of configured [firewall rules](#reference_44F337305232FA0214D2CD1B2BCCEFFF).

If you access this page via the links on the **Automated detection overview** page it is filtered according to your chosen category. It also shows the amount of time left before an address is unblocked
from that category.

#### Investigating Access Failures and Intrusions

If you need to investigate specific access failures or intrusion attempts, you can review all the relevant triggering log
messages associated with each category. To do this:

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to System >  Protection >  Automated detection >  Configuration. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click on the name of the category you want to investigate. |
| **Step 3** | Click View all matching intrusion protection triggers for this category.  The system will display all the relevant events for that category. You can then search through the list of triggering events for the relevant event details such as a user name, address or alias. |

---

#### Automated Protection Service and Clustered Systems

When the automated protection service is enabled in a clustered system:

* Each peer maintains its own count of connection failures and the trigger threshold must be reached on each peer for the intruder's
  address to be blocked by that peer.
* Addresses are blocked against only the peer on which the access failures occurred. This means that if an address is blocked
  against one peer it may still be able to attempt to access another peer (from which it may too become blocked).
* A blocked address can only be unblocked for the current peer. If an address is blocked by another peer, you must log in to
  that peer and then unblock it.
* Category settings and the exemption list are applied across the cluster.
* The statistics displayed on the **Automated detection overview** page are for the current peer only.

#### Automated Protection in MRA Deployments

The Expressway-C receives a lot of inbound traffic from Unified CM and from the Expressway-E when it is used for Mobile and
Remote Access.

If you want to use automated protection on the Expressway-C, you should add exemptions for all hosts that use the automatically
created neighbor zones and the Unified Communications secure traversal zone. The Expressway does not automatically create
exemptions for discovered Unified CM or related nodes.

#### Additional Information

* When a host address is blocked and tries to access the system, the request is dropped (the host receives no response).
* A host address can be blocked simultaneously for multiple categories, but may not necessarily be blocked by all categories.
  Those blocks may also expire at different times.
* When an address is unblocked (either manually or after its block duration expires), it has to fail again for the full number
  of times as specified by the category's trigger level before it will be blocked for a second time by that category.
* A category is reset whenever it is enabled. All categories are reset if the system is restarted or if the automated protection
  service is enabled at the system level. When a category is reset:

  + Any currently blocked addresses are unblocked.
  + Its running totals of failures and blocks are reset to zero.
* You can view all Event Log entries associated with the automated protection service by clicking **View all intrusion protection events** on the Automated detection overview page.
* From X14.0 release:

  + SIP registration failure is enabled by default for new installations and factory reset cases. In case of upgrade scenario,
    the previous value is retained.
  + SIP authentication failure is enabled by default for new installations and factory reset cases. In case of upgrade scenario,
    the pervious value is retained.
  + Disable the SIP authentication failure jail rule on Expressway-C if it is impacting the service.

### Configuring rate limits

The Rate limits overview page (System > Protection > Rate limits  > Configuration) is used to limit SIP traffic rate under which Expressway can perform without any issues like crash, high CPU usage, high
memory usage etc.

From X14.0 release, rate limit is enabled by default for SIP traffic.

1. By default, 100 connections per second are allowed with a burst limit of 20 which come on the SIP ports 5060, 5061, & 5062.
2. You can enable/disable or change number of connections per second and burst limit.
3. Connections per second range value is 1 to 150 and default value is 100.
4. Burst limit range value is 15 to 30 and default value is 20.
5. The bar graph shows number of connections established over the time and number of connections dropped.

| **Important** | ---  * In case of TCP protocol only "NEW" state is considered as new connection. All the related and established connections are treated as same connection, so that   the packets are not dropped from the existing connection. * In case of UDP protocol all the related and established connections as "NEW" connections.  --- |
| --- | --- |

#### **Configuring rate limits rules**

To configure rate limits rules:

1. Go to System > Protection > Rate limits > Configuration
2. Click on the name of the category you want to configure.

   You are taken to the configuration page for that category.
3. Configure the category as required:

   1. Status – whether rate limit mode is enabled or disabled.
   2. Connections (per second) – Change the number of connections per second.
   3. Burst limit – Maximum initial number of connections/packets to match, this number gets recharged by one every time the limit specified
      above is not reached, up to this number.
4. Click Save.

### Configuring System Name and Access Settings

The **System administration** page (System >
Administration) is used to configure the following settings:

* Name of the Cisco Expressway system.
* Methods by which the system may be accessed by administrators. Although you can administer the Expressway through a PC connected
  directly to the unit with a serial cable, you may want to access the system remotely over IP. You can do this using the web
  interface via HTTPS, or through a command line interface via SSH.
* Whether to use FindMe or other provisioning services from the Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Provisioning Extension.
* Optionally direct management traffic for administration services - web user interface, REST API and CLI - to use Expressway's
  Dedicated Management Interface (DMI) on LAN3.

Table 1. Settings for the System Administration page

| Field | Description | Usage Tips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **System name** | Used to identify the Expressway. Appears in various places in the web interface, and in the display on the front panel of the unit (so that you can identify it when it is in a rack with other systems). | We recommend using a name which allows you to easily and uniquely identify the system. |
| **Ephemeral port range** | The **start** and **end** values define the port range to use for ephemeral outbound connections that are not otherwise constrained by Expressway call processing. |  |
| **Services** | | |
| **Serial port / console** | Whether the system can be accessed locally via the VMware console.  Default is *On*. | Serial port / console access is always enabled for one minute following a restart, even if it is normally disabled. |
| **SSH service** | Whether the Expressway can be accessed via SSH and SCP.  Default is *On*. |  |
| **Web interface (over HTTPS)** | Whether the Expressway can be accessed via the web interface.  Default is *On*. |  |
| **Provisioning services** | Whether the System >  TMS Provisioning Extension services page is accessible in the Expressway web user interface. From there you can connect to the Cisco TelePresence Management Suite Provisioning Extension (Cisco TMSPE) and its provisioning services for users, devices, FindMe and phone books.  Default is *Off*. | FindMe is deprecated in Expressway from X12.5 and support will be withdrawn in a subsequent release. |
| **Use Dedicated Management Interface only** | Optionally requires management traffic for administration services - web user interface, REST API and CLI - to use Expressway's Dedicated Management Interface (DMI) on LAN3.  Default is *No*. | The same function is available for SNMP management traffic, from the System >   SNMP page. |
| **Session limits** | | |
| **Session time out** | The number of minutes that an administration session (serial port, HTTPS or SSH) or a FindMe session may be inactive before the session is timed out. Default is 30 minutes. |  |
| **Per-account session limit** | The number of concurrent sessions that each individual administrator account is allowed on each Expressway. | This includes web, SSH and serial sessions. Session limits are not enforced on the root account.  A value of 0 turns session limits off. |
| **System session limit** | The maximum number of concurrent administrator sessions allowed on each Expressway. | This includes web, SSH and serial sessions. Session limits are not enforced on the root account. However active root account sessions do count towards the total number of current administrator sessions.  A value of 0 turns session limits off. |
| **System protection** | | |
| **Automated protection service** | Whether the [automated protection service](#reference_C2F36B56C07F9273A3E3F4BDD1D75348) is active.  Default is *On*. | After enabling the service you need to configure the specific [protection categories](#reference_C2F36B56C07F9273A3E3F4BDD1D75348__section_ehn_hqn_nnb). |
| **Automatic discovery protection** | Controls how management systems such as Cisco TMS can discover this Expressway.  *Off*: Automatic discovery is allowed.  *On*: Cisco TMS must be manually configured to discover this Expressway and must provide administrator account credentials.  Default is *Off*. | Restart the system for any changes to take effect. |
| **Web server configuration** | | |
| **Redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS** | Determines whether HTTP requests are redirected to the HTTPS port.  Default is *Off*. | HTTPS must also be enabled for access via HTTP to function.  When you enter the address without prepending the protocol, your browser assumes HTTP (on port 80). If this setting is *On*, Expressway redirects the browser to the **Web administrator port**. |
| **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)** | Determines whether web browsers are instructed to only ever use a secure connection to access this server. Enabling this feature gives added protection against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.  *On*: The Strict-Transport-Security header is sent with all responses from the web server, with a 1 year expiry time.  *Off*: The Strict-Transport-Security header is not sent, and browsers work as normal.  Default is *On*. | See below for more information about HSTS. |
| **Web administrator port** | Sets the https listening port for administrators to access the Expressway web interface.  We strongly recommend using a non-default port for web administration on the Expressway-E if you enable any features that need TCP 443, eg. Meeting Server Web Proxy.  Restart the Expressway to make this change effective. | If you use a non-default port, and you prepend the `https://` protocol to the address, you must append the port. For example, you would put the address  *https://vcse.example.com:7443* into your browser; if you try *https://vcse.example.com*, the browser assumes port 443 and the Expressway denies access.  Web access to the Expressway could be lost if a network element blocks traffic to the web admin port - you can use SSH or the console to change the port if necessary. |
| **Client certificate-based security** | Controls the level of security required to allow client systems (typically web browsers) to communicate with the Expressway over HTTPS.  *Not required*: The client system does not have to present any form of certificate.  *Certificate validation*: The client system must present a valid certificate that has been signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA).   | **Note** | Restart is required if you are changing from *Not required* to *Certificate validation*. | | --- | --- |   *Certificate-based authentication*: The client system must present a valid certificate that has been signed by a trusted CA and contains the client's authentication credentials.  Default: *Not required* | | **Important** | * *Enabling Certificate validation* means that your browser (the client system) can use the Expressway web interface only if it has a valid (in date and not   revoked by a CRL) client certificate that is signed by a CA in the Expressway's trusted CA certificate list. * Ensure your browser has a valid client certificate before enabling this feature. The procedure for uploading a certificate   to your browser may vary depending on the browser type and you may need to restart your browser for the certificate to take   effect. * You can upload CA certificates on the [Managing the Trusted CA Certificate List](exwy_m_managing-security.html#reference_A54E54BC4D1DB995885958B8D74001BD) page, and test client certificates on the [Testing Client Certificates](exwy_m_managing-security.html#reference_46DC3F5D62B2F0D307EF3ECA524C7797) page. * *Enabling Certificate-based authentication* means that the standard login mechanism is no longer available. You can log in only if your browser certificate is valid   and the credentials it provides have the appropriate authorization levels. You can configure how the Expressway extracts credentials   from the browser certificate on the [Certificate-based Authentication Configuration](exwy_m_managing-security.html#reference_BCD936F444AADC9C4311E0B1820A89AD) page. * This setting does not affect client verification of the Expressway's server certificate. | | --- | --- | |
| **Certificate revocation list (CRL) checking** | Specifies whether HTTPS client certificates are checked against certificate revocation lists (CRLs).  *None*: No CRL checking is performed.  *Peer*: Only the CRL associated with the CA that issued the client's certificate is checked.  *All*: All CRLs in the trusted certificate chain of the CA that issued the client's certificate are checked.  Default: *All* | Only applies if  **Client certificate-based security** is enabled. |
| **CRL inaccessibility fallback behavior** | Controls the revocation checking behavior if the revocation status cannot be established, for example if the revocation source cannot be contacted.   * *Treat as revoked*: Treat the certificate as revoked (and thus do not allow the TLS connection). * *Treat as not revoked*: Treat the certificate as not revoked. * Default: *Treat as not revoked* | Only applies if **Client certificate-based security** is enabled. |
| **Deployment Configuration** | | |
| **Configuration** | Determines the size of the system. The possible options are:  *Large*: 8 CPU cores , 6 GB memory, and 1 Gbps or 10 Gbps NIC.  *Medium*: 2 CPU cores: 4 GB memory, and 1 Gbps NIC. | If you upgrade a *Medium system* with a 1 Gbps NIC, Expressway **automatically converts the appliance to a Large system**. As a result, Expressway-E listens for multiplexed RTP/RTCP traffic on default demultiplexing ports for Large systems (36000 to 36011). In this case, Expressway drops the calls because these ports are not open on the firewall.  If this problem occurs, do either of the following:   * To change the system default size to Medium and use the ports that you have configured for multiplexed RTP/RTCP traffic, select   **Medium**. * If you prefer to use it as Large system, open the default demultiplexing ports for Large systems on the firewall.   This option is available only for CE1200 and later appliances that are deployed as Expressway-Es, and with the following minimum specification:   * Supported Expressway software version (detailed in the *Cisco Expressway CExxxx Installation Guide* for your appliance) * CPU: 8 cores * Memory: 6 GB * NIC: 1 Gbps |

By default, access via HTTPS and SSH is enabled. For optimum security, disable HTTPS and SSH and use the serial port to manage
the system. Because access to the serial port allows the password to be reset, we recommend that you install the Expressway
in a physically secure environment.

* [HTTP Strict Transport Security](#reference_F5EC6AC52793136E2D746683B2D83BF7)

#### HTTP Strict Transport Security

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a mechanism for a web server to force a web browser to communicate with it using
secure connections only. Depending on the version, it may not be supported by all browsers. When HSTS is enabled, a browser
that supports HSTS will:

* Automatically turn any insecure links to the website into secure links before accessing the server(for example, `http://example.com/page/` is modified to `https://example.com/page/`).
* Only allow access to the server if the connection is secure (for example, the server's TLS certificate is valid, trusted,
  and not expired).

Browsers that do not support HSTS ignore the Strict-Transport-Security header and work as before. They will still be able
to access the server.

Compliant browsers only respect Strict-Transport-Security headers if they access the server through its fully qualified name,
rather than its IP address.

### Configuring SNMP Settings

The **SNMP** page (System >
SNMP) is used to configure the Expressway SNMP settings.

Tools such as Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (Cisco TMS) or HP OpenView may act as SNMP Network Management Systems (NMS).
They allow you to monitor your network devices, including the Expressway, for conditions that might require administrative
attention. The Expressway supports the most basic MIB-II tree (.1.3.6.1.2.1) as defined in *[RFC 1213](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1213)*.

The information made available by the Expressway includes:

* System uptime
* System name
* Location
* Contact
* Interfaces
* Disk space, memory, and other machine-specific statistics

SNMP is disabled by default. So to allow the Expressway to be monitored by an SNMP NMS (including Cisco TMS) you need to select
an alternative **SNMP mode**. The configurable options are:

| Field | Description | Usage Tips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **SNMP mode** | Controls the level of SNMP support.  *Disabled*: no SNMP support.  *v3 secure SNMP*: supports authentication and encryption.  *v3 plus TMS support*: secure SNMPv3 plus non-secure access to OID 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 only.  *v2c*: non-secure community-based SNMP. | If you want to use secure SNMPv3 but you also use Cisco TMS as your external manager, you must select *v3 plus TMS support*. |
| **Description** | Custom description of the system as viewed by SNMP. The default is to have no custom description (empty field). | When you leave this field empty, the system uses its default SNMP description. |
| **Community name** | The Expressway's SNMP community name.  The default is *public*. | Only applies when using *v2c* or *v3 plus TMS support*. |
| **System contact** | The name of the person who can be contacted regarding issues with the Expressway.  The default is *Administrator*. | The **System contact** and **Location** are used for reference purposes by administrators when following up on queries. |
| **Location** | Specifies the physical location of the Expressway. |  |
| **Username** | The Expressway's SNMP username, used to identify this SNMP agent to the SNMP manager. | Only applies when using *v3 secure SNMP* or *v3 plus TMS support*. |
| **Use Dedicated Management Interface only** | Optionally requires management traffic for SNMP to use Expressway's Dedicated Management Interface (DMI) on LAN3.  Default is *No*. | The same function is available for management traffic related to administration services - web user interface, REST API, and CLI - from the System >   Administration settings page. |
| **v3 Authentication** settings (only applicable to SNMPv3) | | |
| **Authentication mode** | Enables or disables SNMPv3 authentication. |  |
| **Type** | The algorithm used to hash authentication credentials. From X12.5.7, SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) is the only supported option. MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5) passwords are not supported. |  |
| **Password** | The password used to encrypt authentication credentials. | Must be at least 8 characters. |
| **v3 Privacy** settings (only applicable to SNMPv3) | | |
| **Privacy mode** | Enables or disables SNMPv3 encryption. |  |
| **Type** | The security model used to encrypt messages.  *AES*: Advanced Encryption Standard 128-bit encryption.  The default and recommended setting is  *AES*. |  |
| **Password** | The password used to encrypt messages. | Must be at least 8 characters. |

The Expressway does not support SNMP traps or SNMP sets, therefore it cannot be managed via SNMP.

| **Note** | ---   SNMP is disabled by default, because of the potentially sensitive nature of the information involved. Do not enable SNMP on a Expressway on the public internet or in any other environment where you do not want to expose internal system information.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Configuring Time Settings

The **Time** page (System >
Time) is used to configure the Expressway's NTP servers and to specify the local time zone.

An NTP server is a remote server with which the Expressway synchronizes in order to ensure its time is accurate. The NTP server
provides the Expressway with UTC time.

Accurate time is necessary for correct system operation.

* [Configuring the NTP Servers](#reference_83DAEEB8FE3983A733B2EA6655456530)
* [Expressway Time Display and Time Zone](#concept_BADD76A8AD777C31799F2121B5E4BCB0)

#### Configuring the NTP Servers

To configure the Expressway with one or more NTP servers to be used when synchronizing system time, enter the `Address` of up to five servers in one of the following formats, depending on the system's DNS settings (you can check these settings
on the **DNS** page, System >
DNS):

* If there are no **DNS servers** configured, you must use an IP address for the NTP server
* If there are one or more **DNS servers** configured, you can use an FQDN or IP address for the NTP server
* If there is a DNS **Domain name** configured in addition to one or more **DNS servers**, you can use the server name, FQDN or IP address for the NTP server

Three of the Address fields default to NTP servers provided by Cisco.

You can configure the **Authentication** method used by the Expressway when connecting to an NTP server. Use one of the following options for each NTP server connection:

| Authentication method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *Disabled* | No authentication is used. |
| *Symmetric key* | Symmetric key authentication. When using this method a **Key ID**, **Hash** method and **Pass phrase** must be specified. The values entered here must match exactly the equivalent settings on the NTP server. You can use the same symmetric key settings across multiple NTP servers. However, if you want to configure each server with a different pass phrase, you must also ensure that each server has a unique key ID. |
| *Private key* | Private key authentication. This method uses an automatically generated private key with which to authenticate messages sent to the NTP server. |

##### Displaying NTP status information

The synchronization status between the NTP server and the Expressway is shown in the **Status** area as follows:

* *Starting*: The NTP service is starting.
* *Synchronized*: The Expressway has successfully obtained accurate system time from an NTP server.
* *Unsynchronized*: The Expressway is unable to obtain accurate system time from an NTP server.
* *Down*: The Expressway's NTP client is not running.
* *Reject*: The NTP service is not accepting NTP responses.

| **Note** | ---   Updates may take a few minutes to be displayed in the status table.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Other status information available includes:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **NTP server** | The actual NTP server that has responded to the request. This may be different to the NTP server in the NTP server address field. |
| **Condition** | Gives a relative ranking of each NTP server. All servers that are providing accurate time are given a status of *Candidate*; of those, the server that the Expressway considers to be providing the most accurate time and is therefore using shows a status of *sys.peer*. |
| **Flash** | A code giving information about the server's status. `00 ok` means there are no issues. See the [Flash Status Word Reference Table](exwy_m_reference-material.html#reference_D3E31A8E6B4A2D5F53CF1B246C6A058E) for a complete list of codes. |
| **Authentication** | Indicates the status of the current authentication method. One of  *ok*, *bad* or *none*. *none* is specified when the **Authentication** method is *Disabled*. |
| **Event** | Shows the last event as determined by NTP (for example *reachable* or *sys.peer*) |
| **Reachability** | Indicates the results of the 8 most recent contact attempts between the Expressway and the NTP server, with a tick indicating success and a cross indicating failure. The result of the most recent attempt is shown on the far right.  Each time the NTP configuration is changed, the NTP client is restarted and the Reachability field will revert to all crosses apart from the far right indicator which will show the result of the first connection attempt after the restart. However, the NTP server may have remained contactable during the restart process. |
| **Offset** | The difference between the NTP server's time and the Expressway's time. |
| **Delay** | The network delay between the NTP server and the Expressway. |
| **Stratum** | The degree of separation between the Expressway and a reference clock. `1` indicates that the NTP server is a reference clock. |
| **Ref ID** | A code identifying the reference clock. |
| **Ref time** | The last time that the NTP server communicated with the reference clock. |

For definitions of the remaining fields on this page, and for further information about NTP, see [Network Time Protocol](http://www.ntp.org/) website.

#### Expressway Time Display and Time Zone

Local time is used throughout the web interface. It is shown in the system information bar at the bottom of the screen and
is used to set the timestamp that appears at the start of each line in the Event Log.

| **Note** | ---   UTC timestamps are included at the end of each entry in the Event Log.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Internally, the Expressway maintains its system time in UTC. It is based on the Expressway's operating system time, which
is synchronized using an NTP server if one is configured. If no NTP servers are configured, the Expressway uses its own operating
system time to determine the time and date.

Specifying your local **Time zone** lets the Expressway determine the local time where the system is located. It does this by offsetting UTC time by the number
of hours (or fractions of hours) associated with the selected time zone. It also adjusts the local time to account for summer
time (also known as daylight saving time) when appropriate.

### Configuring the Login Page

Use the **Login page configuration** page (System >
Login page) to specify a message and image to appear on the login page. The **Welcome message title** and **text** appears to administrators when they log in using the CLI or the web interface.

You can upload an image to appear above the welcome message on the login page, in the web interface.

* Supported image file formats are JPG, GIF and PNG.
* Images larger than 200x200 pixels are scaled down.

Optionally you can specify that the welcome message must be acknowledged before the person logging in is allowed to continue.
In this case the system displays an acceptance button, which the user must click to continue.

If the Expressway is using the [TMS Provisioning Extension services](exwy_m_status-and-system-information.html#reference_8C7BAA86451A2105353325042D54C589) to provide FindMe account data, then users log into their FindMe accounts through Cisco TMS, not through Expressway.

| **Note** | ---   This feature is not configurable using the CLI.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Configuring External Manager Settings

The **External Manager** page (System >
External Manager) is used to configure the Expressway connection to an external management system.

An external manager is a remote system, such as the Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (Cisco TMS), used to monitor events
occurring on the Expressway, for example call attempts, connections and disconnections, and as a place for where the Expressway
can send alarm information. The use of an external manager is optional.

| **Note** | ---   Cisco TMS identifies the Expressway as a "TANDBERG VCS".   --- |
| --- | --- |

The Expressway will continue to operate without loss of service if its connection to Cisco TMS fails. This applies even if
the Expressways are clustered. No specific actions are required as the Expressway and Cisco TMS will automatically start communicating
with each other again after the connection is re-established.

| Field | Description | Usage Tips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Address and path** | To use an external manager, you must configure the Expressway with the IP address or host name and path of the external manager to be used. | If you are using Cisco TMS as your external manager, use the default path of  tms/public/external/management/SystemManagementService.asmx |
| **Protocol** | Determines whether communications with the external manager are over *HTTP* or *HTTPS*.  The default is *HTTPS*. |  |
| **Certificate verification mode** | Controls whether the certificate presented by the external manager is verified. | If you enable verification, you must also add the certificate of the issuer of the external manager's certificate to the file containing the Expressway's trusted CA certificates. This is done from the [Managing the Trusted CA Certificate List](exwy_m_managing-security.html#reference_A54E54BC4D1DB995885958B8D74001BD) page (Maintenance >  Security >  Trusted CA certificate). |

## Configuring the Dedicated Management Interface (DMI)

From X12.7, Expressway supports the Dedicated Management Interface (DMI). This is a new network interface that uses the third
LAN port (LAN3) to access Expressway for management-related activities. Instead of sharing a routing interface with other
traffic, management traffic is sent and received through LAN3 and no other traffic uses that port.

The DMI is disabled by default.

| **Note** | ---   If you are using a physical CE1200 appliance, connect **port 3a** (See "Figure 2: Rear view of the Cisco Expressway") provided on your physical appliance and configure the DMI address on it as explained in the chapter "Rear Panel Layout". For specific instructions, see "Cisco Expressway CE1200 Appliance Installation Guide".   --- |
| --- | --- |

* [Introduction to the DMI](#reference_8E9BC4BFCB34F780654EA58A09F0D690)
* [How to Configure the DMI](#task_6B018E11138197D341DDDBB4A13E3386)

### Introduction to the DMI

Enabling the DMI has two aspects:

1. Enabling the DMI function - this switches on the LAN3 port for management traffic. However, it is not exclusive and LAN1 (and
   LAN2 if configured) can also be used - Expressway continues to listen for management traffic on LAN1/LAN2 as well, not just
   on the LAN3 port.
2. If you want LAN3 to be the only interface for management traffic, you need to configure the individual management services
   in Expressway for DMI only.

   | **Note** | ---   If you have management servers outside the LAN3 subnet, currently you also need to configure static IP routes in order for their traffic to be directed to LAN3.   --- |
   | --- | --- |

Expressway management traffic can be classified as server-based or client-based.

Management traffic where Expressway is the server:

* HTTP(S) - for web UI administration and REST API
* ssh - for CLI (not for MRA tunnels)
* SNMP

Management traffic where Expressway is the client, for example:

* HTTP(S) for feedback events to external managers like Cisco TMS
* NTP
* directory (LDAP, Active Directory)
* remote syslog
* system metrics (collectd)

### How to Configure the DMI

**Enable DMI**
#### Before you begin

The new DNS name for the DMI interface must be entered as a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) on the Expressway server certificate.
If an IP address is used to access the interface (or a DNS that is not a SAN entry in the certificate) a certificate validation
warning will be issued and access may be blocked.

| **Caution** | ---   It is essential to properly secure the DMI, as it provides access into the Expressway configuration.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to System >  Network Interfaces >  IP and set **Use Dedicated Management Interface** to *Yes*. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the **LAN3 - DMI** section:   1. Specify the IPv4 and/or IPv6 address of the LAN3 port. 2. For IPv4 also specify the subnet mask. 3. For IPv6 use a static, global address. It cannot be link-local or stateless SLAAC. 4. Optionally change the maximum Ethernet packet size that can be sent over the DMI by setting the **Maximum transmission unit (MTU)** for the port. The default is 1500 bytes. |
| **Step 3** | Restart the system. These changes require a restart to take effect.  The DMI is now activated on LAN3 as an interface for management traffic. If you want the DMI to be the *sole* interface for management, go on to the next tasks.   | **Note** | For Expressway VMs, the OVF template includes a customization option to define the DMI IP address. | | --- | --- | |

---

* [(Optional) Make DMI Sole Interface](#reference_A5F3EA6C26D4BFB2C1C1CC0D11221721)

#### (Optional) Make DMI Sole Interface

##### (Optional) Make DMI sole interface - server management traffic

Use this task to make management traffic use the DMI, where Expressway is the server.

| **Caution** | ---   Before you do this, make sure that the required services are accessible on LAN3, else they won't have access after the change to DMI only. This is especially important for administration services, as the only way to recover them would be to turn off DMI using the console (serial/VMWare).   --- |
| --- | --- |

1. You can do this for administration services (web user interface, REST API, and CLI) and/or for SNMP. Do either or both the
   following steps, depending on which services you want to configure for DMI only:

   * Go to System >
     SNMP and in the **Configuration** section set Use Dedicated Management Interface only to *Yes*.
   * Go to System >
     Administration settings and in the **Services** section set Use Dedicated Management Interface only (for administration) to *Yes*.
2. You need to restart the system for the changes to take effect for the web user interface and the API, which remain accessible
   from LAN1 / LAN2 until you restart. Changes take immediate effect for the command line interface (SSH) and SNMP service, regardless
   of restart.

The specified management services can now be accessed only from the DMI / LAN3 port.

| **Note** | ---   Expressway will not let you disable the DMI while a management service is configured to use it as the only interface.   --- |
| --- | --- |

##### (Optional) Make DMI sole interface - client management traffic outside subnet

For management traffic where Expressway acts as the client, depending on your Expressway version the traffic will only be
directed to the DMI if the target server is in the same subnet as the DMI / LAN3 port. If it's not possible to deploy the
server in the same subnet as LAN3, you can optionally force Expressway management traffic to use the DMI, by configuring static
IP routes for LAN3 per service.

**Example**

This example assumes an Expressway with these subnets:

* LAN3 subnet range: a.b.128.0 - a.b.191.255
* LAN1 subnet range: x.y.156.0 - x.y.159.255

Say you want to configure NTP with Expressway. The NTP server is in the LAN1 subnet. You want outgoing NTP traffic from Expressway
and incoming responses from NTP to use the DMI / LAN3. This can be achieved by creating a static route for LAN3 (System >
 Network interfaces >
Static routes select Add) with the following settings:

* IP address: *x.y.151.0*
* Prefix length: *24*
* Gateway: *172.22.128.1* (gateway of LAN3 subnet)
* Interface: *LAN3*

For more details, see [Static Routes](#reference_237D2BEEDF5895678A345546A9CB3B71).

## Configuring TMS Provisioning Extension Services

Cisco TMSPE services are hosted on Cisco TMS. They provide the user, device, and phone book data used by the Expressway's
[Provisioning Server](exwy_m_applications.html#reference_C75B2E9841B0ED4A5D93BFEAB6C099AF) to service provisioning requests from endpoint devices. They also provide the Expressway with FindMe account configuration
data for FindMe services.

From X8.11, the Cisco TMS-hosted provisioning services are enabled through the  System >
Administration settings page in the web user interface or the device provisioning CLI command (*xconfiguration Administration DeviceProvisoning*). You do not need special option keys or licenses to enable these services. The following device provisioning services are
available:

* Users
* FindMe
* Phone Books
* Devices

For new installations all services are off by default. For existing systems your current service settings are preserved and
remain unchanged after upgrading.

* [Before You Start](#reference_209DB5CCA62B142D4915F2E5685E2B12)
* [Configuration Settings](#reference_E976B6842C5B258F61D7E74DACB98D0A)

### Before You Start

If you have not already done so, go to System >
Administration and set Provisioning services to *On*. Then you can use the System >
TMS Provisioning Extension services page to configure how Expressway connects to Cisco TMSPE services, and which services you want. (To configure the services
themselves, we recommend using the TMS. Changes to Cisco TMSPE service configuration settings made through Expressway **are not applied in TMS**.)

FindMe is a special case. If you enable provisioning services you may see the following configuration warning alarms. If you
plan to use FindMe only, and no other provisioning services, you can ignore these alarms:

* *For phone book requests to work correctly, authentication policy must be enabled on the Default Subzone and any other relevant
  subzone; authentication must also be enabled on the Default Zone if the endpoints are not registered.*
* *For provisioning to work correctly, authentication policy must be enabled on the Default Zone and any other relevant zone
  that receives provisioning requests.*

### Configuration Settings

The configurable options for provisioning services are described in the table:

Table 2. Configurable Options for Provisioning Services

| Field | Description | Usage Tips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Default connection configuration**  This section specifies default connection settings for accessing Cisco TMSPE services. Each service can choose to use these settings, or specify its own connection settings (for example, if a different Cisco TMSPE server is in use per service). | | |
| **Server address** | The IP address or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the service. |  |
| **Destination port** | The listening port on the Cisco TMSPE service. |  |
| **Encryption** | The encryption to connect the Cisco TMSPE service. For more information see [Configuring Minimum TLS Version and Cipher Suites.](exwy_m_managing-security.html#reference_2CD01278669B0E2ED4633003848711B2)  *Off*: No encryption.  *TLS*: Provides TLS encryption.  Default is *TLS*. | A TLS connection is recommended. |
| **Verify certificate** | Controls whether the certificate presented by the Cisco TMSPE service is verified against the Expressway's current trusted CA list and (if any) revocation list.  Default is *Yes*. | If verification is enabled:   * IIS (on the Cisco TMSPE server) must be installed with a signed certificate and be set to enforce SSL connections. * You must add the certificate of the issuer of the Cisco TMSPE server's certificate to the file containing the Expressway's   trusted CA certificates. Do this from the [Managing the Trusted CA Certificate List](exwy_m_managing-security.html#reference_A54E54BC4D1DB995885958B8D74001BD) page (Maintenance >    Security >    Trusted CA certificate). |
| **Check certificate hostname** | Controls whether the hostname contained within the certificate presented by the Cisco TMSPE service is verified by the Expressway.  Default is *Yes*. | Applies if **Verify certificate** is *Yes*.  If enabled, the certificate hostname (the Common Name) must match the specified **Server address**. If the server address is an IP address, the required hostname is obtained through a DNS lookup. |
| **Base group** | The ID used to identify this Expressway (or Expressway cluster) with the Cisco TMSPE service. | The TMS administrator will supply this value.  The **Base group** ID used by the **Devices** service must be explicitly specified as it is normally different from that used by the other services. |
| **Authentication username** and **password** | The username and corresponding password used by the Expressway to authenticate itself with the Cisco TMSPE service. | If TLS encryption is not enabled, the authentication password is sent in the clear. |
| **Service-specific configuration**  You can specify the connection details for each of the Cisco TMSPE services: **Users**, **FindMe**, **Phone books**, and **Devices**. | | |
| **Connect to this service** | Controls whether the Expressway connects to the Cisco TMSPE service.  Default is *No*. | If *Yes*, the status of an enabled connection is shown next to the field: *Checking*, *Active* or *Failed*. (Click [details](exwy_m_status-and-system-information.html#reference_8C7BAA86451A2105353325042D54C589) to view full status information.) |
| **Polling interval** | The frequency with which the Expressway checks the Cisco TMSPE service for updates. Defaults are:  **FindMe**: *2 minutes*  **Users**: *2 minutes*  **Phone books**: *1 day*  The **Device** service polling interval is set to 30 seconds and cannot be modified. | You can request an immediate update of all services by clicking Check for updates at the bottom of the page. |
| **Use the default connection configuration** | Controls whether the service uses the default connection configuration for Cisco TMSPE services.  Default is *Yes*. | If *No*, an additional set of connection configuration parameters appears. There you can specify alternative connection details, to override the default connection settings for the service. |

You can do an immediate resynchronization of data between Expressway and Cisco TMS at any time by clicking Perform full synchronization on the  **TMS Provisioning Extension services** page. This will result in a few seconds lack of service on the Expressway while data is deleted and refreshed. If you only
need to apply recent updates in Cisco TMS to the Expressway, click Check for updates instead.

This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of certain crafted software images that are uploaded to the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the system as an administrative user and then uploading specific crafted software images to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system as the *root* user.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ewrce-QPynNCjh>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS releases earlier than the first fixed release if they were running Release X8.6 or later.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  While the following mitigations have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment. Firewall Rule Modifications Access to the management plane of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS should be restricted to trusted networks. Administrators can restrict access to the management ports (HTTPS/SSH) within the firewall rules on the device or by using an external firewall. The web UI port numbers can also be modified in the configuration.  As a best practice, access to the management plane of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS should not be exposed to the internet. For additional information, see the [Intrusion Protection](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/expressway/admin_guide/X14-0/exwy_b_cisco-expressway-administrator-guide/exwy_m_network-and-system-settings.html#reference_749C6B6E7566A37934C9AD39ED91E612) section of the [Cisco Expressway Administrator Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/expressway/admin_guide/X14-0/exwy_b_cisco-expressway-administrator-guide/exwy_m_managing-security.html). Dedicated Management Interface As a best practice, access to the management plane of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS should not be exposed to the internet. Beginning with Release X12.7, the product introduced a Dedicated Management Interface (DMI). Administrators can enable the DMI and implement the following configuration:    + Allow the DMI to be the only interface used for management   + Configure the DMI to be accessed only from trusted segments For additional information, see [Configuring the Dedicated Management Interface (DMI)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/expressway/admin_guide/X14-0/exwy_b_cisco-expressway-administrator-guide/exwy_m_network-and-system-settings.html#reference_5EB4447A6E9556705392D8970EC2EA50) section of the [Cisco Expressway Administrator Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/expressway/admin_guide/X14-0/exwy_b_cisco-expressway-administrator-guide/exwy_m_managing-security.html). Client Certificate-Based Security This vulnerability can be exploited only by an authenticated administrator. Using client authentication certificates helps prevent brute forcing of the administrative passwords. For additional information, see the [Configuring Certificate-Based Authentication](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/expressway/admin_guide/X14-0/exwy_b_cisco-expressway-administrator-guide/exwy_m_managing-security.html#reference_BCD936F444AADC9C4311E0B1820A89AD) section of the [Cisco Expressway Administrator Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/expressway/admin_guide/X14-0/exwy_b_cisco-expressway-administrator-guide/exwy_m_managing-security.html).  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Fixed Releases At the time of publication, Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS Release X14.0.3 and later contained the fix for this vulnerability.  For information about fixed software releases, see the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.  Recommendations  * Cisco recommends that customers upgrade to a fixed software release to address this vulnerability and implement the following best practices:    + Not exposing the management plane to the internet   + Changing all administrative passwords Cisco advises that customers who cannot upgrade to a fixed software release should immediately reinstall their current software release from a copy of software from Cisco.com and change any administrative passwords until they can upgrade to a fixed software release.  Customers should follow best practices for the image downloaded from Cisco.com by validating the SHA512 checksum value, available on Cisco.com, prior to installing the downloaded software.

For additional information, see the [Intrusion Protection](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/expressway/admin_guide/X14-0/exwy_b_cisco-expressway-administrator-guide/exwy_m_network-and-system-settings.html#reference_749C6B6E7566A37934C9AD39ED91E612) section of the [Cisco Expressway Administrator Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/expressway/admin_guide/X14-0/exwy_b_cisco-expressway-administrator-guide/exwy_m_managing-security.html). Dedicated Management Interface As a best practice, access to the management plane of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS should not be exposed to the internet. Beginning with Release X12.7, the product introduced a Dedicated Management Interface (DMI). Administrators can enable the DMI and implement the following configuration:    + Allow the DMI to be the only interface used for management   + Configure the DMI to be accessed only from trusted segments For additional information, see [Configuring the Dedicated Management Interface (DMI)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/expressway/admin_guide/X14-0/exwy_b_cisco-expressway-administrator-guide/exwy_m_network-and-system-settings.html#reference_5EB4447A6E9556705392D8970EC2EA50) section of the [Cisco Expressway Administrator Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/expressway/admin_guide/X14-0/exwy_b_cisco-expressway-administrator-guide/exwy_m_managing-security.html). Client Certificate-Based Security This vulnerability can be exploited only by an authenticated administrator. Using client authentication certificates helps prevent brute forcing of the administrative passwords. For additional information, see the [Configuring Certificate-Based Authentication](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/expressway/admin_guide/X14-0/exwy_b_cisco-expressway-administrator-guide/exwy_m_managing-security.html#reference_BCD936F444AADC9C4311E0B1820A89AD) section of the [Cisco Expressway Administrator Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/expressway/admin_guide/X14-0/exwy_b_cisco-expressway-administrator-guide/exwy_m_managing-security.html).  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Fixed Releases At the time of publication, Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS Release X14.0.3 and later contained the fix for this vulnerability.  For information about fixed software releases, see the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.  Recommendations  * Cisco recommends that customers upgrade to a fixed software release to address this vulnerability and implement the following best practices:    + Not exposing the management plane to the internet   + Changing all administrative passwords Cisco advises that customers who cannot upgrade to a fixed software release should immediately reinstall their current software release from a copy of software from Cisco.com and change any administrative passwords until they can upgrade to a fixed software release.  Customers should follow best practices for the image downloaded from Cisco.com by validating the SHA512 checksum value, available on Cisco.com, prior to installing the downloaded software.

Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

## Security Basics

* [Data at Rest](#concept_9FB64D1DBB0784BC0B75E80EB3D0FA6D)
* [TLS and Certificates](#concept_807A470BE544BFB881B101BC7538BCC9)

### Data at Rest

Every software installation (from X8.11) has a unique root of trust. Each Expressway system has a unique key that is used
to encrypt data local to that system. This improves the security of data at rest in the following ways:

* The new key is created when you upgrade a pre-X8.11 version to X8.11 or later, and is used to encrypt all data on the first
  restart.
* Only this key can be used to decrypt data from this system. No other Expressway key can decrypt this system's data.
* The key is never exposed on the UI, and it is never logged--locally or remotely.

### TLS and Certificates

For TLS encryption to work successfully in a connection between a client and server:

* The server must have a certificate installed that verifies its identity, which is signed by a Certificate Authority (CA).
* The client must trust the CA that signed the certificate used by the server.

Expressway lets you install a certificate that can represent the Expressway as either a client or a server in TLS connections.
Expressway can also authenticate client connections (typically from a web browser) over HTTPS. You can upload certificate
revocation lists (CRLs) for the CAs used to verify LDAP server and HTTPS client certificates. Expressway can generate server
certificate signing requests (CSRs), so there is no need to use an external mechanism to do this.

| **Note** | ---   For all secure communications (HTTPS and SIP/TLS), we recommend that you replace the Expressway default certificate with a certificate generated by a trusted CA.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Table 1. Expressway Role in Different Connection Types

| In connections... | The Expressway acts as... |
| --- | --- |
| To an endpoint. | TLS server. |
| To an LDAP server. | Client. |
| Between two Expressway systems. | Either Expressway may be the client. The other Expressway is the TLS server. |
| Over HTTPS. | Web browser is the client. Expressway is the server. |

| **Note** | ---   We also recommend using a third-party LDAP browser to verify that your LDAP server is correctly configured for TLS.   --- |
| --- | --- |

TLS can be difficult to configure. So if using it with an LDAP server, for example, we recommend verifying that the system
works correctly over TCP, before you attempt to secure the connection with TLS.

| **Caution** | ---   Certificates must be RFC-compliant. Do not allow CA certificates or CRLs to expire, as this may cause certificates signed by those CAs to be rejected.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Certificate and CRL files are managed via the web interface, and cannot be installed using the CLI.

## Configuring Certificate-Based Authentication

The **Certificate-based authentication configuration** page (Maintenance >
 Security >
 Certificate-based authentication configuration) is used to configure how the Expressway retrieves authorization credentials (the username) from a client browser's certificate.

This configuration is required if **Client certificate-based security** (defined on the [System](exwy_m_network-and-system-settings.html#reference_66E773DDE58E7DB564000035558A0A05) page) is set to *Certificate-based authentication*. This setting means that the standard login mechanism is no longer available and that administrators (and FindMe accounts,
if accessed via the Expressway) can log in only if they present a valid browser certificate - typically provided via a smart
card (also referred to as a Common Access Card or CAC) - and the certificate contains appropriate credentials that have a
suitable authorization level.

| **Step 1** | Add the Expressway's trusted CA and server certificate files (on the **Trusted CA certificate** and **Server certificate** pages, respectively). |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Configure certificate revocation lists (on the **CRL management** page). |
| **Step 3** | Use the **Client certificate testing** page to verify that the client certificate you intend to use is valid. |
| **Step 4** | Set **Client certificate-based security** to *Certificate validation* (on the **System administration** page). |
| **Step 5** | Restart the Expressway. |
| **Step 6** | Use the **Client certificate testing** page again to set up the required regex and format patterns to extract the username credentials from the certificate. |
| **Step 7** | Only when you are sure that the correct username is being extracted from the certificate, set **Client certificate-based security** to *Certificate-based authentication*. |

---

### Authentication Versus Authorization

When the Expressway is operating in certificate-based authentication mode, user authentication is managed by a process external
to the Expressway.

When a user attempts to log in to the Expressway, the Expressway will request a certificate from the client browser. The browser
may then interact with a card reader to obtain the certificate from the smart card (or alternatively the certificate may already
be loaded into the browser). To release the certificate from the card/browser, the user will typically be requested to authenticate
themselves by entering a PIN. If the client certificate received by the Expressway is valid (signed by a trusted certificate
authority, in date and not revoked by a CRL) then the user is deemed to be authenticated.

To determine the user's authorization level (read-write, read-only and so on) the Expressway must extract the user's authorization
username from the certificate and present it to the relevant local or remote authorization mechanism.

| **Note** | ---   If the client certificate is not protected (by a PIN or some other mechanism) then unauthenticated access to the Expressway may be possible. This lack of protection may also apply if the certificates are stored in the browser, although some browsers do allow you to password protect their certificate store.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Obtaining the Username from the Certificate

The username is extracted from the client browser's certificate according to the patterns defined in the Regex and Username format fields on the **Certificate-based authentication configuration** page:

* In the Regex field, use the (?<name>regex ) syntax to supply names for capture groups so that matching sub-patterns can be substituted in the associated Username format field, for example,

  /(Subject:.\*, CN=(?<Group1>.\*))/m.

  The regex defined here must conform to [PHP regex guidelines](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pcre.php).
* The Username format field can contain a mixture of fixed text and the capture group names used in the **Regex**. Delimit each capture group name with # , for example, prefix#Group1#suffix . Each capture group name will be replaced with the text obtained from the regular expression processing.

You can use the [Client certificate testing](#reference_46DC3F5D62B2F0D307EF3ECA524C7797) page to test the outcome of applying different **Regex** and **Username format** combinations to a certificate.

### Emergency Account and Certificate-Based Authentication

Advanced account security mode requires that you use only remote authentication, but also mandates that you have an emergency
account in case the authentication server is unavailable. See [Configuring Advanced Account Security Mode](#reference_C0FAB0B806FC653F8F43CCAD8AC88F87).

If you are using certificate-based authentication, the emergency account must be able to authenticate by presenting a valid
certificate with matching credentials.

You should create a client certificate for the emergency account, make sure that the CN matches the **Username format**, and load the certificate into the emergency administrator's certificate store.

## Managing the Trusted CA Certificate List

The **Trusted CA certificate** page (Maintenance >
Security >
Trusted CA certificate) allows you to manage the list of certificates for the Certificate Authorities (CAs) trusted by this Expressway. When a TLS
connection to Expressway mandates certificate verification, the certificate presented to the Expressway must be signed by
a trusted CA in this list and there must be a full chain of trust (intermediate CAs) to the root CA.

* To upload a new file containing one or more CA certificates, Browse to the required PEM file and click Append CA certificate. This will append any new certificates to the existing list of CA certificates. If you are replacing existing certificates
  for a particular issuer and subject, you have to manually delete the previous certificates.
* To replace all of the currently uploaded CA certificates with the system's original list of trusted CA certificates, click
  Reset to default CA certificate.
* To view the entire list of currently uploaded trusted CA certificates, click Show all (decoded) to view it in a human-readable form, or click Show all (PEM file) to view the file in its raw format.
* To view an individual trusted CA certificate, click on View (decoded) in the row for the specific CA certificate.
* To delete one or more CA certificates, tick the box(es) next to the relevant CA certificate(s) and click Delete.

| **Note** | ---   If you have enabled certificate revocation list (CRL) checking for TLS encrypted [connections to an LDAP server](exwy_m_user-accounts.html#concept_27EF4DB0C9EFA01BCB274A443E759CA3) (for account authentication), you must add the PEM encoded CRL data to your trusted CA certificate file.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Root CAs included by default

Expressway X12.6 and later includes these trusted root CAs, which are installed as part of the *Cisco Intersection CA Bundle*:

* O=Internet Security Research Group, CN=ISRG Root X1
* O=Digital Signature Trust Co., CN=DST Root CA X3

## Managing the Expressway Server Certificate

Use the **Server certificate** page (Maintenance >
Security >
Server certificate) to manage the Expressway server certificate, which identifies Expressway when it communicates with client systems using
TLS encryption and with web browsers over HTTPS.

You can view details of the currently loaded certificate, generate a CSR, upload a new certificate, and configure the ACME
service. These tasks are described in the Cisco Expressway Certificate Creation and Use Deployment Guide on the [Expressway Configuration Guides](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/unified-communications/expressway-series/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html) page.

| **Note** | ---   We strongly recommend using certificates based on RSA keys.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Other types of certificate, such as those based on DSA keys, are not tested and may not work with Expressway in all scenarios.

* [Using the ACME Service](#reference_A6F350FB7D29A6B410F482B78435933F)
* [Server Certificates and Clustered Systems](#reference_FABA1139C375656E070C0DF5CB307B48)
* [Server Certificates and Unified Communications](#reference_30269151DBD5081BFD4332B0D6E69B10)

### Using the ACME Service

From X12.5 the Cisco Expressway Series supports the ACME protocol (Automated Certificate Management Environment) which enables
automatic certificate signing and deployment to the Expressway-E from a certificate authority such as Let's Encrypt.

### Server Certificates and Clustered Systems

When a CSR is generated, a single request and private key combination is generated for that peer only. If you have a cluster
of Expressways, you must generate a separate signing request on each peer. Those requests must then be sent to the certificate
authority and the returned server certificates uploaded to each relevant peer.

Make sure that the correct server certificate is uploaded to the appropriate peer, otherwise the stored private key on each
peer will not correspond to the uploaded certificate.

### Server Certificates and Unified Communications

If you deploy Mobile and Remote Access, details about the Unified Communication and Expressway certificate requirements are
in the Cisco Expressway Certificate Creation and Use Deployment Guide on the [Expressway Configuration Guides](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/unified-communications/expressway-series/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html) page.

## Managing Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)

Certificate revocation list files (CRLs) are used by the Expressway to validate certificates presented by client browsers
and external systems that communicate with the Expressway over TLS/HTTPS. A CRL identifies those certificates that have been
revoked and can no longer be used to communicate with the Expressway.

We recommend that you upload CRL data for the CAs that sign TLS/HTTPS client and server certificates. When enabled, CRL checking
is applied for every CA in the chain of trust.

* [Certificate Revocation Sources](#reference_4B74492BC1F3B78D55FD85358435CF71)
* [Configuring Revocation Checking for SIP TLS Connections](#reference_8F720E15819D44B23E90B764D94BC666)

### Certificate Revocation Sources

The Expressway can obtain certificate revocation information from multiple sources:

* Automatic downloads of CRL data from CRL distribution points.
* Through OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) responder URIs in the certificate to be checked (SIP TLS only).
* Manual upload of CRL data.
* CRL data embedded within the Expressway's **Trusted CA certificate** file.

* [Limitations and Usage Guidelines](#concept_5725E8DA9BD3A7F24B5ECA7C7A74A3B2)
* [Automatic CRL Updates](#task_8EEAF4A4E58F5FD9EDBA0F39B8D283B4)
* [Manual CRL Updates](#task_2FAB1023AAC608688250DAAE0542228A)
* [Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)](#concept_BDC4581888A5778B12B15A951DFD00C8)

#### Limitations and Usage Guidelines

The following limitations and usage guidelines apply:

* When establishing SIP TLS connections, the CRL data sources are subject to the **Certificate revocation checking** settings on the **SIP**  configuration page.
* Automatically downloaded CRL files override any manually loaded CRL files (except for when verifying SIP TLS connections,
  when both manually uploaded or automatically downloaded CRL data may be used).
* When validating certificates presented by external policy servers, the Expressway uses manually loaded CRLs only.
* When validating TLS connections with an LDAP server for remote login account authentication, the Expressway only uses CRL
  data that has been embedded into the **Trusted CA certificate** (Tools >
  Security >
  Trusted CA certificate).

  For LDAP connections, Expressway does not download the CRL from Certificate Distribution Point URLs in the server or issuing
  CA certificates. Also, it does not use the manual or automatic update settings on the **CRL management** page.

#### Automatic CRL Updates

| **Note** | ---   We recommend that you configure the Expressway to perform automatic CRL updates. This ensures that the latest CRLs are available for certificate validation.   --- |
| --- | --- |

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to Maintenance >  Security >  CRL management. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Set **Automatic CRL updates** to *Enabled*. |
| **Step 3** | Enter the set of **HTTP(S) distribution points** from where the Expressway can obtain CRL files.   | **Note** | * You must specify each distribution point on a new line * Only HTTP(S) distribution points are supported; if HTTPS is used, the distribution point server itself must have a valid certificate * PEM and DER encoded CRL files are supported * The distribution point may point directly to a CRL file or to ZIP and GZIP archives containing multiple CRL files * The file extensions in the URL or on any files unpacked from a downloaded archive do not matter as the Expressway will determine   the underlying file type for itself; however, typical URLs could be in the format:    + <http://example.com/crl.pem>   + <http://example.com/crl.der>   + <http://example.com/ca.crl>   + <https://example.com/allcrls.zip>   + <https://example.com/allcrls.gz> | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | Enter the `Daily update time` (in UTC). This is the approximate time of day when the Expressway will attempt to update its CRLs from the distribution points. |
| **Step 5** | Click Save. |

---

#### Manual CRL Updates

You can upload CRL files manually to the Expressway. Certificates presented by external policy servers can only be validated
against manually loaded CRLs.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to Maintenance >  Security >  CRL management. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Browse and select the required file from your file system. It must be in PEM encoded format. |
| **Step 3** | Click Upload CRL file.  This uploads the selected file and replaces any previously uploaded CRL file.  Click Remove revocation list if you want to remove the manually uploaded file from the Expressway.  If a certificate authority's CRL expires, all certificates issued by that CA will be treated as revoked. |

---

#### Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)

The Expressway can establish a connection with an OCSP responder to query the status of a particular certificate.The Expressway
determines the OCSP responder to use from the responder URI listed in the certificate being verified. The OCSP responder sends
a status of "good", "revoked" or "unknown" for the certificate.

The benefit of OCSP is that there is no need to download an entire revocation list. OCSP is supported for SIP TLS connections
only. See below for information on how to enable OCSP.

Outbound communication from the Expressway-E is required for the connection to the OCSP responder. Check the port number of
the OCSP responder you are using (typically this is port 80 or 443) and ensure that outbound communication is allowed to that
port from the Expressway-E.

### Configuring Revocation Checking for SIP TLS Connections

You must also configure how certificate revocation checking is managed for SIP TLS connections.

1. Go to Configuration >
   SIP.
2. Scroll down to the **Certificate revocation checking** section and configure the settings accordingly:

   | Field | Description | Usage Tips |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Certificate revocation checking mode | Controls whether revocation checking is performed for certificates exchanged during SIP TLS connection establishment. | We recommend that revocation checking is enabled. |
   | Use OCSP | Controls whether the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) may be used to perform certificate revocation checking. | To use OCSP:  * The X.509 certificate to be checked must contain an OCSP responder URI. * The OCSP responder must support the SHA-256 hash algorithm. If it is not supported, the OCSP revocation check and the certificate   validation will fail. |
   | Use CRLs | Controls whether Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) are used to perform certificate revocation checking. | CRLs can be used if the certificate does not support OCSP.  CRLs can be loaded manually onto the Expressway, downloaded automatically from preconfigured URIs (see [Managing Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)](#reference_EEA5DC103CF5C16B988B08860C1D19A0)), or downloaded automatically from a CRL distribution point (CDP) URI contained in the X.509 certificate. |
   | Allow CRL downloads from CDPs | Controls whether the download of CRLs from the CDP URIs contained in X.509 certificates is allowed. |  |
   | Fallback behavior | Controls the revocation checking behavior if the revocation status cannot be established, for example if the revocation source cannot be contacted.  *Treat as revoked*: Treat the certificate as revoked (and thus do not allow the TLS connection).  *Treat as not revoked*: Treat the certificate as not revoked.  Default: *Treat as not revoked* | *Treat as not revoked* ensures that your system continues to operate in a normal manner if the revocation source cannot be contacted, however it does potentially mean that revoked certificates will be accepted. |

## Managing mTLS Client Certificate Verification for MRA Onboarding

The **CA certificate page for mTLS** is accessed from the **Trusted CA certificate** page (Maintenance >
Security >
Trusted CA certificate). This page only applies if you use Expressway for Mobile and Remote Access (MRA) with Cisco Unified Communications products,
and onboarding with activation codes is enabled for MRA.

## Testing Client Certificates

The **Client certificate testing** page (Maintenance >
Security >
Client certificate testing) is used to check client certificates before enabling [client certificate validation](exwy_m_network-and-system-settings.html#reference_66E773DDE58E7DB564000035558A0A05). You can:

* Test whether a client certificate is valid when checked against the Expressway's current trusted CA list and, if loaded, the
  revocation list (see  [Managing Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)](#reference_EEA5DC103CF5C16B988B08860C1D19A0)).
* Test the outcome of applying the regex and template patterns that retrieve a certificate's authorization credentials (the
  username).

You can test against a certificate on your local file system or the browser's currently loaded certificate.

* [To test if a certificate is valid](#task_1C7C9A46F2D980F02B961B28AAA3E938)
* [To retrieve authorization credentials (username) from the certificate](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_27e91dff-5513-4a78-a205-3db41062c458)

### To test if a certificate is valid

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select the Certificate source. You can choose to:   * Upload a test file from your file system in either PEM or plain text format; if so click Browse to select the certificate file you want to test * Test against the certificate currently loaded into your browser (only available if the system is already configured to use   *Certificate validation* and a certificate is currently loaded) |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Ignore the **Certificate-based authentication pattern** section - this is only relevant if you are extracting authorization credentials from the certificate. |
| **Step 3** | Click Check certificate. The results of the test are shown in the **Certificate test results** section. |

---

### To retrieve authorization credentials (username) from the certificate

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select the Certificate source as described above. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Configure the Regex and Username format fields as required. Their purpose is to extract a username from the nominated certificate by supplying a regular expression that will look for an appropriate string pattern within the certificate. The fields default to the currently configured settings on the **Certificate-based authentication configuration** page but you can change them as required.   * In the Regex field, use the (?<name>regex ) syntax to supply names for capture groups so that matching sub patterns can be substituted in the associated Username format field, for example,  /(Subject:.\*, CN=(?<Group1>.\*))/m.  The regex defined here must conform to [PHP regex guidelines](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pcre.php). * The Username format field can contain a mixture of fixed text and the capture group names used in the **Regex**. Delimit each capture group name with # , for example, prefix#Group1#suffix . Each capture group name will be replaced with the text obtained from the regular expression processing. |
| **Step 3** | Click Check certificate. The results of the test are shown in the **Certificate test results** section. The **Resulting string** item is the username credential that would be checked against the relevant authorization mechanism to determine that user's authorization (account access) level. |
| **Step 4** | If necessary, you can modify the Regex and Username format fields and repeat the test until the correct results are produced.   | **Note** | If the **Certificate source** is an uploaded PEM or plain text file, the selected file is temporarily uploaded to the Expressway when the test is first performed:   * If you want to keep testing different **Regex** and **Username format** combinations against the same file, you do not have to reselect the file for every test. * If you change the contents of your test file on your file system, or you want to choose a different file, you must click Browse again and select the new or modified file to upload. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 5** | If you have changed the Regex and Username format fields from their default values and want to use these values in the Expressway's actual configuration (as specified on the **Certificate-based authentication configuration** page) then click Make these settings permanent.   | **Note** | * Any uploaded test file is automatically deleted from the Expressway at the end of your login session. * The regex is applied to a plain text version of an encoded certificate. The system uses the command openssl x509 -text -nameopt RFC2253 -noout to extract the plain text certificate from its encoded format. | | --- | --- | |

## Testing Secure Traversal

This utility tests whether a secure connection can be made from the Expressway-C to the Expressway-E. A secure connection
is required for a Unified Communications traversal zone, and is optional (recommended) for a normal traversal zone.

If the secure traversal test fails, the utility raises a warning with appropriate resolution where possible.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | On the Expressway-C, go to Maintenance >  Security >  Secure traversal test. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Enter the FQDN of the Expressway-E that is paired with this Expressway-C. |
| **Step 3** | Enter the TLS verify name of this Expressway-C, as it appears on the paired Expressway-E.  This setting is in the SIP section of the Expressway-E's traversal zone configuration page. |
| **Step 4** | Click Test connection.  The secure traversal test utility checks whether the hosts on either side of the traversal zone recognize each other and trust each others' certificate chains.   | **Note** | You must select the version of **HTTPS minimum TLS version** to test the applicability of a secure connection that enables the minimum supported TLS version by Expressway. Also, select the **HTTPS ciphers** for the same. This selection of *HTTPTLSversion* is required for connection establishment towards Unified Communication servers like VCSE, CUCM, CUP, and UCXN. These settings are configured on the  **Ciphers** page (Maintenance >  Security >  Ciphers). | | --- | --- | |

---

## Managing the Expressway Server Certificate with HSM

| **Important** | ---   HSM functionality support on Expressway may be a **Preview feature only**, depending on the Expressway software version. For example, it is a Preview feature in version X12.6. Please check the release notes for your Expressway version before you use HSM and if its status is Preview for your software version, **only enable HSM if you are willing to implement it as a Preview feature and subject to the Preview disclaimer contained in the Expressway Release Notes**. Instructions for how to configure and enable HSM are currently provided only in the Expressway Release Notes.   --- |
| --- | --- |

These instructions assume that HSM is already enabled on Expressway (Maintenance >
Security >
HSM configuration).

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Go to Maintenance >  Security >  Server certificate. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click Generate CSR. You are navigated to the **Generate CSR** page.  The **Server certificate type** section displays at the top of the **Generate CSR** page. If HSM usage is not configured, the section does not display.  If you have an Expressway cluster, issues may arise if the CSR fields are incorrectly completed. For details on how to fill these fields, see the Cisco Expressway Cluster Creation and Maintenance Deployment Guide on the  [Cisco Expressway Series Configuration Guides](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/unified-communications/expressway-series/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html) page. |
| **Step 3** | After generating as HSM private key and CSR, you are returned to the **Server certificate** page. |
| **Step 4** | You can view and download the generated HSM CSR from the  **Certificate signing request (CSR)** section. |
| **Step 5** | Click Download to download the certificate. |
| **Step 6** | Sign the certificate using certificate signing authority. |

---

* [Install the HSM private key and certificate](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_03c5a91e-98bd-495c-b896-0e4edc1301f3)
* [Download the HSM key handle across a cluster](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_d8c2635c-dc07-42e8-8da7-41d293360536)
* [Restart Expressway](#Cisco_Concept.dita_0f2b7553-9722-44c0-b93d-cc86b41efeb6)

### Install the HSM private key and certificate

| **Note** | ---   Only use these instructions if you use Hardware Security Module (HSM) functionality.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | To upload a signed certificate, click Choose File to navigate to the location and choose the certificate. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Select a certificate file and corresponding certificate type, and click Upload server certificate data to upload the certificate.  For more information, see the section about managing the Expressway's server certificate. |

---

### Download the HSM key handle across a cluster

After deploying an HSM certificate and private key to an Expressway, the HSM certificate and private key can be deployed to
other Expressways in a cluster. To do this:

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | On the primary peer. Download the HSM private key from the first Expressway. After deploying an HSM certificate and private key, a Download HSM key handle button displays on the **Server certificate data** section. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | On the cluster peers. Upload the HSM private key with HSM certificate to other peers in the cluster from the **Upload new certificate** section. Browse to and select the signed HSM certificate and private key. |

---

### Restart Expressway

After an HSM certificate is installed on Expressway, a banner on the **Server certificate** page prompts you to restart Expressway. An alarm is also raised to restart. Although the certificate is now installed, the
restart is required for the Expressway to begin using it.

After the restart, the alarm disappears and all services on the Expressway use the new HSM certificate.

## Configuring Hardware Security Module Functionality

The **HSM configuration** page (Maintenance >
Security >
HSM configuration) is used to manage HSM devices with Expressway.

| **Important** | ---   HSM functionality may be a **Preview feature only**, depending on the Expressway software version. For example, it is a Preview feature in version X12.6. Please check the release notes for your Expressway version before you use HSM and if its status is Preview for your software version, only enable HSM if you are willing to implement it as a Preview feature. Instructions for how to configure HSM are currently provided only in the Expressway release notes and not in this section.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Configuring Minimum TLS Version and Cipher Suites

The Maintenance >
Security >
Ciphers page is used to manage the minimum TLS version for services on Expressway, and their associated cipher suites.

| **Note** | ---   For improved security, TLS version 1.2 or later is recommended for all encrypted sessions.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Expressway defaults to TLS 1.2 when establishing secure connections for the following:

* HTTPS
* Certificate checker
* Cisco Meeting Server discovery
* SIP
* XMPP
* UC server discovery
* Reverse proxy
* LDAP
* SMTP mail server
* TMS Provisioning Service

### Restart required in some cases

A restart is required after changing the cipher suite configuration or TLS protocol version for the following:

* SIP
* XCP

* [Minimum TLS Version](#reference_4DBB857A1F1924E36837753778780546)
* [Cipher Suites](#reference_E43B108612B0C8AD33C0185D5C95565D)

### Minimum TLS Version

On upgrade of an existing system, the previous behavior and defaults persist so you won't be defaulted to TLS 1.2.

For new installations, check that all browsers and other equipment that must connect to Expressway support TLS 1.2.

If required--typically for compatibility reasons with legacy equipment--the minimum TLS versions can be configured per service
to use versions 1.0 or 1.1.

### Cipher Suites

You can configure the cipher suite and minimum supported TLS version for services on the Expressway. The cipher suites are
shown in the table (cipher strings are in OpenSSL format):

For services where the Expressway can act as a client, such as HTTPS, the same minimum TLS version and cipher suites will
be negotiated.

| Services | Cipher Suite Values (Defaults) |
| --- | --- |
| HTTPS ciphers | EECDH:EDH:HIGH:-  AES256+SHA:!MEDIUM:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!PSK:!eNULL:!aNULL |
| Reverse proxy TLS ciphers | EECDH:EDH:HIGH:-  AES256+SHA:!MEDIUM:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!PSK:!eNULL:!aNULL |
| SIP TLS ciphers | EECDH:EDH:HIGH:-  AES256+SHA:!MEDIUM:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!PSK:!eNULL:+ADH |
| UC server discovery TLS ciphers | EECDH:EDH:HIGH:-  AES256+SHA:!MEDIUM:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!PSK:!eNULL:!aNULL |
| XMPP TLS ciphers | EECDH:EDH:HIGH:-  AES256+SHA:!MEDIUM:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!PSK:!eNULL:!aNULL |
| LDAP TLS ciphers | EECDH:EDH:HIGH:-  AES256+SHA:!MEDIUM:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!PSK:!eNULL:!aNULL |
| TMS TLS ciphers | EECDH:EDH:HIGH:-  AES256+SHA:!MEDIUM:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!PSK:!eNULL:!aNULL |
| SMTP ciphers | EECDH:EDH:HIGH:-  AES256+SHA:!MEDIUM:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!PSK:!eNULL:!aNULL |

#### SIP behavior—disable ADH recommendation

Some endpoints, for example the E20, only support Anonymous Diffie-Hellman (ADH) when you connect to them, so ADH is enabled
in the default cipher suites. However, if it's an inbound connection, for security reasons you should always add `!ADH` to disable it.

Be aware that removing the ADH from SIP will cause the outbound connections to some legacy endpoints to fail.

## Configuring SSH

### Tunnel Configuration

The Expressway pair uses SSH tunnels to securely transfer data from the Expressway-E to the Expressway-C without requiring
Expressway-E to open the connection. The Expressway-C opens a TCP session with the Expressway-E which is listening on a fixed
TCP port. The pair then use the selected cipher and algorithms to establish an encrypted tunnel for securely sharing data.

The cipher and algorithms that the pair use to encrypt SSH tunnels are configured as follows:

1. Go to Maintenance > Security > SSH configuration.
2. Modify the following settings, if necessary:

   | Setting | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | Ciphers | *aes256-ctr*: Advanced Encryption Standard using the CTR (counter) mode to encipher 256-bit blocks. (Default) |
   | Public Key Algorithms | *X509v3-sign-rsa* (Default) *X509v3-ssh-rsa* |
   | Key Exchange Algorithms | *ecdh-sha2-nistp256* *ecdh-sha2-nistp384*(Default) |
3. Click Save.

### Remote Access Configuration

The cipher and algorithms that the pair use to encrypt remote access between a SSH client and server are configured as follows:

1. Go to Maintenance > Security > SSH configuration.
2. Modify the following settings, if necessary:

   | Setting | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | Ciphers | *“aes256-gcm@openssh.com,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr”* |
   | Key Exchange Algorithms | *“ecdh-sha2-nistp521,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp256,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1”* |
   | MAC Algorithms | *“hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha1”* |
3. Click Save.

## Advanced Security

The **Advanced security** page (Maintenance >
Advanced security) is used to configure the Expressway for use in highly secure environments. You need to install the **Advanced Account Security** option key to see this page.

You can configure the system for:

* [Advanced account security mode](#reference_C0FAB0B806FC653F8F43CCAD8AC88F87)
* [FIPS140-2 cryptographic mode](#reference_5962E52A2FA9786EF34FD94A1FE3A0B8)

* [Configuring Advanced Account Security Mode](#reference_C0FAB0B806FC653F8F43CCAD8AC88F87)

### Configuring Advanced Account Security Mode

Enabling advanced account security limits login access to remotely authenticated users using the web interface only, and also
restricts access to some system features. To indicate that the Expressway is in advanced account security mode, any text specified
as the **Classification banner** message is displayed on every web page.

A system reboot is required for changes to the advanced account security mode to take effect.

#### HTTP methods

The Expressway web server allows the following HTTP methods:

| Method | Used by Web UI? | Used by API? | Used to... |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | Yes | Yes | Retrieve data from a specified resource. For example, to return a specific page in the Expressway web interface. |
| POST | Yes | Yes | Apply data to a web resource. For example, when an administrator saves changes to a setting using the Expressway web interface. |
| OPTIONS | No | Yes | For a specified URL, returns the HTTP methods supported by the server. For example, the Expressway can use OPTIONS to test a proxy server for HTTP/1.1 compliance. |
| PUT | No | Yes | Send a resource to be stored at a specified URI. Our REST API commands use this method to change the Expressway configuration. |
| DELETE | No | Yes | Delete a specified resource. For example, the REST API uses DELETE for record deletion. |

#### How to disable user access to the API

Administrators have API access by default. This can be disabled in two ways:

* If the Expressway is running in advanced account security mode, then API access is automatically disabled for all users.
* API access for individual administrators can be disabled through their user configuration options.

* [Disabling Advanced Account Security](#task_F5517892253A0B69B356AE28DF39D1CD)

#### Prerequisites

Before you can enable advanced account security mode, the following items are required:

* The system must be configured to use [remote account authentication](exwy_m_user-accounts.html#concept_27EF4DB0C9EFA01BCB274A443E759CA3) for administrator accounts.
* The **Advanced Account Security** option key must be installed.
* You must create a local administrator account and nominate it as the emergency account, so that you can get in if remote authentication
  is unavailable. You cannot use a remote account for this purpose.

  Do not use the built in *admin* account.

| **Caution** | ---   The Expressway will disallow local authentication by all accounts except the emergency account. Ensure that the remote directory service is working properly before you enable the mode.   --- |
| --- | --- |

You are also recommended to configure your system so that:

* [SNMP](exwy_m_network-and-system-settings.html#reference_DFB5B9492007CA101317ECC1C9B481A9) is disabled.
* The [session time out period](exwy_m_network-and-system-settings.html#reference_66E773DDE58E7DB564000035558A0A05) is set to a non-zero value.
* [HTTPS client certificate validation](exwy_m_network-and-system-settings.html#reference_66E773DDE58E7DB564000035558A0A05) is enabled.
* [User account LDAP server](exwy_m_user-accounts.html#concept_27EF4DB0C9EFA01BCB274A443E759CA3) configuration uses TLS encryption and has certificate revocation list (CRL) checking set to *All*.
* [Remote logging](exwy_m_serviceability-logging-monitoring-and-metrics.html#reference_E2C90F723DA668253442AA719304DD36) is disabled.
* [Incident reporting](exwy_m_diagnostics-and-troubleshooting.html#reference_E2C827EE06F75AE2D6E3748E0DF77095) is disabled.
* Any connection to an [external manager](exwy_m_network-and-system-settings.html#reference_5EB5EC608E456181A22813627ECFF502) uses HTTPS and has certificate checking enabled.

Alarms are raised for any non-recommended configuration settings.

#### Expressway Functionality: Changes and Limitations

When in secure mode, the following changes and limitations to standard Expressway functionality apply:

* Access over SSH and through the serial port is disabled and cannot be turned on (the pwrec password recovery function is also
  unavailable).
* Access over HTTPS is enabled and cannot be turned off.
* The command line interface (CLI) and API access are unavailable.
* Administrator account authentication source is set to *Remote only* and cannot be changed.
* Local authentication is disabled. There is no access using the root account or any local administrator account except the
  emergency account.
* Only the emergency account may change the emergency account.
* If you are using certificate-based authentication, the emergency account must be authenticated by credentials in the client's
  certificate. See [Emergency Account and Certificate-based Authentication](#reference_B071610B3E8B848BC5A7D21074D69545).
* If there are three consecutive failed attempts to log in (by the same or different users), login access to the Expressway
  is blocked for 60 seconds.
* Immediately after logging in, the current user is shown statistics of when they previously logged in and details of any failed
  attempts to log in using that account.
* Administrator accounts with read-only or read-write access levels cannot view the Event Log, Configuration Log and Network
  Log pages. These pages can be viewed only by accounts with *Auditor* access level.
* The **Upgrade** page only displays the **System platform** component.

The Event Log, Configuration Log, Network Log, call history, search history and registration history are cleared whenever
the Expressway is taken out of advanced account security mode.

| **Note** | ---   If [intrusion protection](exwy_m_network-and-system-settings.html#reference_C2F36B56C07F9273A3E3F4BDD1D75348) is enabled, this will cause any existing blocked addresses to become unblocked.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Disabling Advanced Account Security

| **Note** | ---   This operation wipes all configuration. You cannot maintain any configuration or history when exiting this mode. The system returns to factory state.   --- |

### Configuring FIPS140-2 Cryptographic Mode

FIPS140 is a U.S. and Canadian government standard that specifies security requirements for cryptographic modules. FIPS140-1
became a mandatory standard for the protection of sensitive data in 1994 and was superseded by FIPS140-2 in 2001. Expressway
X8.8 or later implements FIPS140-2 compliant features.

When in FIPS140-2 cryptographic mode, system performance may be affected due to the increased cryptographic workload.

You can cluster Expressways that have FIPS140-2 mode enabled.

* [Prerequisites](#Cisco_Concept.dita_93485feb-510c-4e09-8c7f-15797dfef9d6)
* [Enable FIPS 140-2 Cryptographic Mode](#task_EE52CE081E6B27C7FBDFE163311707BF)

#### Prerequisites

Before you enable FIPS140-2 mode:

* Ensure that the system is not using NTLM protocol challenges with a direct Active Directory Service connection for device
  authentication; NTLM cannot be used while in FIPS140-2 mode.
* If login authentication via a remote LDAP server is configured, ensure that it uses TLS encryption if it is using SASL binding.
* The **Advanced Account Security** option key must be installed.

FIPS140-2 compliance also requires the following restrictions:

* System-wide SIP transport mode settings must be TLS: *On*, TCP: *Off* and UDP: *Off*.
* All SIP zones must use TLS.
* SNMP and NTP server connections should use strong hashing and encryption. Use these settings:

  **System > SNMP > v3 Authentication > Type =** *SHA*

  **System > SNMP > v3 Privacy > Type =** *AES*

  **System > Time > NTP server *n* > Authentication=** *Symmetric key*

  **System > Time > NTP server *n* > Hash=** *SHA-1*

If your system is running as a virtualized application and has never been through an upgrade process, perform a system upgrade
before you continue. You can upgrade the system to the same software release version that it is currently running. If you
do not complete this step, the activation process described below will fail.

#### Enable FIPS 140-2 Cryptographic Mode

| **Caution** | ---   The transition to FIPS 140-2 cryptographic mode requires a system reset to be performed. This will remove all existing configuration data. To preserve your data you should take a backup immediately prior to performing the reset, and then restore the backup file when the reset has completed.  The reset removes all administrator account information and reinstates the default security certificates. To log in after the reset has completed you will have to first complete the Install Wizard.  To turn your system into a compliant FIPS 140-2 cryptographic system:   --- |
| --- | --- |

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Enable FIPS 140-2 cryptographic mode:   1. Go to Maintenance >     Advanced security. 2. Set FIPS 140-2 cryptographic mode to *On*. 3. Click Save. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Fix any alarms that have been raised that report non-compliant configuration.   | **Note** | When you enable FIPS in a Mobile and Remote Access scenario, if alarm #40042 (some SIP configuration is not using TLS transport; FIPS 140-2 compliance requires TLS) is raised you can disable and enable this feature to clear the alarm. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | Take a [system backup](exwy_m_maintenance.html#reference_7C29075A55A5FF588C4C3CBC51F968CC) if you want to preserve your current configuration data.   | **Note** | Ensure that all backups require password protection. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | Reset the system and complete the activation of FIPS140-2 mode:   1. Log in to Expressway as **root**. 2. Type `fips-activate`.   The reset takes up to 30 minutes to complete. |
| **Step 5** | Follow the prompts to complete the Install Wizard. |
| **Step 6** | When the system has applied the configuration and restarted, log in as `admin` using the password you set.  You may see alarms related to non-compliance with FIPS 140-2. Ignore these alarms if you intend to restore the backup taken prior to the reset. You must take action if they persist after restoring the backup. |
| **Step 7** | [Restore](exwy_m_maintenance.html#reference_2AC16E90D5165F414B44437BC7D8E348) your previous data, if required.   | **Note** | While in FIPS 140-2 mode, you can only restore backup files that were taken when FIPS 140-2 cryptographic mode is set to *On*. Any previous administrator account information and passwords will be restored however, the previous **root** account password is not restored. If the data you are restoring contains untrusted security certificates, the restart that occurs as part of the restore process may take up to 6 minutes to complete. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 8** | From X12.6 you must manually change the SIP TLS Diffie-Hellman key size from the default 1024 bits, to at least 2048. To do this type the following command in the Expressway command line interface (change the value in the final element if you want a key size higher than 2048): *xconfiguration SIP Advanced SipTlsDhKeySize: "2048"* |
