- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An integer overflow in the `calloc` size calculation within the NVIDIA TLK kernel. Specifically, the multiplication of the count and size parameters can overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow leading to a heap overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Heap overflow could lead to denial of service, information disclosure, and/or data tampering.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access, user interaction required (user-triggered SMC call).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs local access with low privileges and the ability to trigger a specific SMC call that is processed by the vulnerable code.
