- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authentication in the Web-Based Management (WBM) interface of WAGO PLCs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The WBM allows reading and writing of certain parameters without requiring authentication via specially crafted requests. This vulnerability is classified as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read and write settings parameters, potentially causing malfunction of the application after a reboot.
- **Attack vectors**: Attacker sends specially crafted requests to the WBM of the PLC.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the WBM and knowledge about the directory structure of the WBM. No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
