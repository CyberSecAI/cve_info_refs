Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-34605

**Vulnerability:** Zip-slip vulnerability

**Affected Product:** XINJE PLC Program Tool (specifically versions 3.5.1 and prior)

**Root Cause:** The software extracts files from a ZIP archive without properly sanitizing the file paths, allowing an attacker to write files outside the intended directory.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Relative Path Traversal (CWE-23):** The software does not properly validate the paths of files within a zip archive before extracting them, allowing "../" sequences to write to arbitrary locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files with the permissions of the program (often administrator privileges).
*   **Code Execution:** By overwriting a DLL or other executable file, the attacker can achieve remote code execution.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Could lead to information disclosure, and denial of service.
*   **PLC Compromise**: By injecting malicious code in project files, attacker can compromise PLC devices.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Project File:** An attacker can create a specially crafted malicious project file that, when opened by the XINJE PLC Program Tool, will exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Infected PLC:** An attacker can upload a malicious project file to a PLC, which, when downloaded to the engineering workstation, will trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to a Malicious File:** The attacker needs to be able to get the victim to open a malicious project file or upload a compromised project file to a PLC.
*   **Local Access:** While the vulnerability itself involves the program, the attacker needs some form of access to get the file loaded by the software.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when the program extracts the project file (\*.xdp) to a temporary directory within the installation directory.
*   The program attempts to load DLL files from its local directory using LoadLibrary, which is a separate, related vulnerability tracked as CVE-2021-34606. This DLL hijacking vulnerability is often chained with the zip slip vulnerability to achieve code execution.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Mashav Sapir of Claroty.
*   XINJE was not initially cooperative with the disclosure process.
*   CISA has released an advisory (ICSA-23-024-01) regarding this vulnerability.
