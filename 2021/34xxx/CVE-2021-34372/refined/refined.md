```
Root cause of vulnerability: Integer overflow in a `malloc()` size calculation within the NVIDIA OTE protocol message parsing code of the Trusty driver.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Heap-based buffer overflow due to an integer overflow when calculating the size for memory allocation.
Impact of exploitation: Information disclosure, escalation of privileges, and denial of service.
Attack vectors: Local access.
Required attacker capabilities/position: Local attacker needs to trigger a vulnerable code path with crafted input. User interaction required.
