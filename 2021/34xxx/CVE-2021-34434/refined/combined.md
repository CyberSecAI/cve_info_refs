Package        : mosquitto
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-34434 CVE-2023-0809 CVE-2023-3592 CVE-2023-28366
                 CVE-2021-41039
Debian Bug     : 993400 1001028

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in mosquitto, a MQTT
compatible message broker, which may be abused for a denial of service attack.

CVE-2021-34434

    In Eclipse Mosquitto when using the dynamic security plugin, if the ability
    for a client to make subscriptions on a topic is revoked when a durable
    client is offline, then existing subscriptions for that client are not
    revoked.

CVE-2023-0809

    Fix excessive memory being allocated based on malicious initial packets
    that are not CONNECT packets.

CVE-2023-3592

    Fix memory leak when clients send v5 CONNECT packets with a will message
    that contains invalid property types.

CVE-2023-28366

    The broker in Eclipse Mosquitto has a memory leak that can be abused
    remotely when a client sends many QoS 2 messages with duplicate message
    IDs, and fails to respond to PUBREC commands. This occurs because of
    mishandling of EAGAIN from the libc send function.

Additionally CVE-2021-41039 has been fixed for Debian 11 "Bullseye".

CVE-2021-41039

    An MQTT v5 client connecting with a large number of user-property
    properties could cause excessive CPU usage, leading to a loss of
    performance and possible denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.0.11-1+deb11u1.

For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.11-1.2+deb12u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mosquitto packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=575324#c0)  syncxxx Song [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-09 23:25:40 EDT  ``` Dynamic Security Plugin is supported since Mosquitto 2.0, so this problem will affect version 2.0 and later.   Dynamic Security Plugin sets the default ACL type behaviours to:  * publishClientSend: deny * publishClientReceive: allow * subscribe: deny * unsubscribe: allow  Consider the following scenario: 1. A tenant now have access to some topic like "message/state", and then he connect to broker with "cleanStart=False" and an enough "sessionInteval=10000"  2. The tenant subscribe the topic "message/state"  3. The tenant disconnect from the broker  4. Admin revoke the privilege from this tenant (subscribePattern message/state)  5. The tenant reconnect with "cleanStart=False" and his session will recover include subscription of "message/state" which means he doesn't need to send another "SUBSCRIBE" packet.  6. Because the default "publishClientReceive" is "allow", the tenant still can receive message from topic "message/state"    By the way, we can't update the default ACL with command like "mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec setDefaultACLAccess publishClientSend deny" when the broker is running. This could be a bug. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=575324#c1)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-19 16:10:58 EDT  ``` /cc project lead ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=575324#c2)  Roger Light [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-22 08:59:24 EDT  ``` Thanks for the report, I confirm the behaviour is as you describe.

### Introduction

The Dynamic Security plugin is a Mosquitto plugin which provides role based
authentication and access control features that can be updated whilst the broker
is running, using a special topic based API.

It is supported since Mosquitto 2.0, and should be available in all
installations, but will not be activated by default.

### Concepts

This section describes the concepts of how the plugin operates. If you want to
find out how to use the plugin features, look in the [Installation] section below.

The plugin allows you to create three main objects, `clients`, `groups`, and `roles`.

This document will use the term `clients` to mean the clients defined in the
plugin, and `devices` or `users` to mean the MQTT clients that connect to the
broker.

---

#### Clients

When you want a device or user to be able to connect and authenticate to the
broker, you create a client. Each client has the following attributes:

##### Username

The client username maps to the username provided in the CONNECT packet when a
device connects. The username is unique across the plugin, so attempting to
create a client with a duplicate username will result in an error. The username
acts as the primary key if you want to change anything about the client.

##### Password

The client password maps to the password provided in the CONNECT packet when a
device connects. The password may be unset when a client is created, this will
mean that devices will be unable to connect as the corresponding client.

The password can be updated at any point, but only by a client with the correct
access. Devices typically cannot update their own passwords.

##### Client ID

The client id maps to the client id provided in the CONNECT packet when a
device connects. This is an optional attribute.

If the client id is empty or not provided, then any device can connect with the
username for this client regardless of its client id. This means that multiple
devices could connect with the same credentials at the same time, but sharing
credentials between devices is not recommended.

If the client id is set, then a device can only connect as this client if the
triple of username, password, and client id all match those in the client.

##### Groups

A client can be a member of any number of groups.

##### Roles

A client can be assigned to any number of roles. A role gives the client access
to different topics.

##### Text name

This is an optional text field to give a human friendly name to this client.

##### Text description

This is an optional text field to give a human friendly description to this
client.

##### Disabled

A client can be set to be enabled/disabled at any point. Disabling a client
means that any devices currently connected using the credentials for that
client will be disconnected and unable to reconnect.

---

#### Groups

Multiple clients can be placed in a group. Groups can have roles assigned to
them, so using groups is appropriate where you have a number of clients that
need to have the same access.

Groups have the following attributes:

##### Group name

The group name is the primary name for the group. It is used when modifying the
group in any way, such as adding a client or a role.

##### Roles

A group can be assigned to any number of roles. A role gives the group access
to different topics.

##### Text name

#### Roles

Roles contain multiple access control lists (ACLs), and can be assigned to clients and/or groups.

Roles have the following attributes:

##### Role name

The role name is the primary name for the role. It is used when modifying the
role in any way, such as adding an ACL.

##### Access Control Lists

ACLs are the feature which allows access to topics to be controlled. Checks are
made on different events as they happen: `publishClientSend`,
`publishClientReceive`, `subscribe`, and `unsubscribe`. The `publishClientSend`
event occurs when a device sends a PUBLISH message to the broker, i.e. "is the
device allowed to publish to this topic". The `publishClientReceive` event
occurs when a device is due to receive a PUBLISH message from the broker, i.e.
it has a valid subscription and a matching message has been published to the
broker. The `subscribe` event occurs in response to a device sending a
SUBSCRIBE message, and the `unsubscribe` event occurs in response to a device
sending an UNSUBSCRIBE packet.

The default behaviour of the different events can be set to allow or deny
access. The default behaviour applies if no matching ACL is found.

The default behaviour for the different events when the plugin has first been
configured is:

* `publishClientSend`: deny
* `publishClientReceive`: allow
* `subscribe`: deny
* `unsubscribe`: allow

There is some overlap between `publishClientReceive` and `subscribe`. In most
cases, using a `subscribe` ACL is sufficient to provide the control you need,
however by combining the two types it is possible to e.g. allow subscriptions
to a wildcard topic like `topic/#`, but deny access for device to receive
messages on a specific topic within that hierarchy like 'topic/secret'.

The different events have ACL types associated with them, and it is these ACLs
that you will add to your roles. Each ACL has a `topic`, a `priority`, and can
be set to `allow` or `deny`.

The `publishClientSend` and `publishClientReceive` ACL types map directly to
the events of the same name. The topic can contain wildcards, so allowing send
access to `topic/#` will allow devices to publish to all topics in the
`topic/#` hierarchy, including `topic`.

The `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` events have two ACL types each:
`subscribeLiteral`, `subscribePattern`, `unsubscribeLiteral`, and
`unsubscribePattern`.

The `*Literal` ACL types make a literal comparison between the topic filter
provided for the ACL and the topic filter provided in the SUBSCRIBE or
UNSUBSCRIBE message. This means that setting a `subscribeLiteral` ACL with
topic filter `#` to deny would prevent matching devices from subscribing the
the `#` topic filter only, but still allow them to subscribe to `topic/#`, for
example.

The `*Pattern` ACL types allow or deny access based on a wildcard comparison of
the ACL topic filter and the topic provided in the SUBSCRIBE or UNSUBSCRIBE
message. This means that setting a `subscribePattern` ACL with topic filter `#`
to deny would prevent matching devices from subscribing to any topic at all.

#### Priorities

If you are working with more than one role per client or group, or more than
one group per client, then it is crucial to understand how roles and ACLs are
applied.

The order in which checks are made is determined in part by the `priority` of
groups, roles and ACLs. Each client group has a priority, each client role and
group role has a priority, and each ACL within a role has a priority. If not
set explicitly, priorities will default to -1.

For each of the group, role, and ACL objects, checks are made in priority order
from the highest numerical value to the lowest numerical value. If two objects
of the same type have the same priority, then they will be checked in
lexographical order according to the username/groupname/rolename, but it is
advised to use unique priorities per object type.

When an event occurs that needs an ACL check, the ACLs for that ACL type are
checked in order until there is a matching ACL for the topic in question.

Within each role that is checked, the ACLs are checked in priority order.

The roles assigned to a client are checked first, in priority order.
Each client group is checked in priority order, with all of the roles in a
group being checked in priority order before the next group is checked.

As an example, let us assume we have the following client, groups, and roles:

Client: `sensor`
Groups: `temperature` (priority 2), `humidity` (priority 1)
Roles: `hallway`

Group: `temperature`
Roles: `input` (priority 5), `output` (priority 1)

Group: `humidity`
Roles: `humidity`

Role: `hallway`
ACLs: `Z` (priority 3), `A` (priority 1)

Role: `input`
ACLs: `Z` (priority 3), `A` (priority 3)

Role: `output`
ACLs: `Z` (priority 3), `A` (priority 1)

Role: `humidity`
ACLs: `Z` (priority 3), `A` (priority 1)

We are also assuming we are only looking at single ACL type.

If our client `sensor` triggers an ACL check, the ACLs will be checked in this
order, and the first matching ACL will be used to allow/reject the event:

1. sensor/hallway Z
2. sensor/hallway A
3. temperature/input A (alphabetical sort)
4. temperature/input Z (alphabetical sort)
5. temperature/output Z
6. temperature/output A
7. humidity/humidity Z
8. humidity/humidity A

This is provided as an example that covers all combinations of roles, it is
recommended to use as simple a setup as possible for your situation.

#### Anonymous access

All of the documentation so far assumes that you do not allow anonymous
unauthenticated access - meaning devices or users that connect without a
username.

You may wish to allow anonymous access, but still make use of the dynamic
security plugin, and this is supported through the automatic anonymous group.
If allowed, anything connecting without a username will be assigned to a group
that you define. By assigning roles to that group, you can control what
anonymous devices can access.

### Installation

To use the Dynamic Security plugin, it must be configured in the broker and an
initial plugin configuration must be generated.

To configure the broker, add the following to your configuration file.

Linux/BSD:

```
plugin path/to/mosquitto_dynamic_security.so
plugin_opt_config_file path/to/dynamic-security.json

```

Windows:

```
plugin path\to\mosquitto_dynamic_security.dll
plugin_opt_config_file path\to\dynamic-security.json

```

On Linux you would expect the plugin library to be installed to
`/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/mosquitto_dynamic_security.so` or a similar path,
but this will vary depending on the particular distribution and hardware in
use.

It is recommended to use `per_listener_settings false` with this plugin, so all
listeners use the same authentication and access control.

The `dynamic-security.json` file is where the plugin configuration will be
stored. This file will be updated each time you make client/group/role changes,
during normal operation the configuration stays in memory. To generate an
initial file, use the `mosquitto_ctrl` utility.

```
mosquitto_ctrl dynsec init path/to/dynamic-security.json admin-user

```

Choose your own `admin-user` username. You will be asked for a password for the
client. This user will be assigned the `admin` role, which has the following
access:

* publishClientSend: `$CONTROL/dynamic-security/#` - this allows the client to
  control the Dynamic security plugin.
* publishClientReceive: `$CONTROL/dynamic-security/#` - this allows the client
  to receive information from the plugin. This is not necessary in the default
  configuration, but is included in case the default behaviour for
  `publishClientReceive` is set to `deny`.
* subscribePattern: `$CONTROL/dynamic-security/#` - this allows the client to
  receive information from the plugin.
* publishClientReceive: `$SYS/#` - this allows the client to see the broker
  metrics.
* subscribePattern: `$SYS/#` - this allows the client to see the broker
  metrics.
* publishClientReceive: `#` - this allows the client to examine the messages
  being published by other clients.
* subscribePattern: `#` - this allows the client to examine the messages
  being published by other clients.
* unsubscribePattern: `#` - this allows the client to undo previous
  subscriptions. This is not necessary in the default configuration, but is
  included in case the default behaviour for `unsubscribe` is set to `deny`.

The admin user does not have access to publish to normal application topics in
the `#` hierarchy by default. You are strongly encouraged to keep the admin
user purely for administering the plugin, and create other clients for your
application.

### Usage

All control of the plugin after initial installation is through the MQTT topic
API at `$CONTROL/dynamic-security/v1`. This allows integrations to be built,
but isn't the best choice for people to use directly. The `mosquitto_ctrl`
command provided with Mosquitto implements support for the dynamic security
plugin API, as described below. Other options include the [Management Center
for Mosquitto](https://docs.cedalo.com/mosquitto/management-center/) which is an open source web
based tool for controlling the plugin and other features. The Management Center
is not part of the Mosquitto project.

#### Using mosquitto\_ctrl with a running broker

The initial configuration is the only time that `mosquitto_ctrl` does not
connect to a broker to carry out the configuration. All other commands require
a connection to a broker, and hence a username, password, and whatever else is
required for that particular connection. It is strongly recommended that your
broker connection uses encryption so that your configuration, including new
passwords, is not transmitted in plain text.

The connection options must be given before the `dynsec` part of the command
line:

```
mosquitto_ctrl <connection options> dynsec <command> ...

```

For example:

```
mosquitto_ctrl -u admin -h localhost dynsec <command> ...

```

It is possible to provide the admin password on the command line using `-P
password`, but this is not recommended. If you do not provide a password,
mosquitto\_ctrl will ask you to enter the password when it is needed.

#### Using an options file

For convenience, mosquitto\_ctrl can load an options file which contains a list
of options it should use. This means you can set the encryption options, host,
admin username and any other options once and not have to add them to the
command line every time.

mosquitto\_ctrl will try to load a configuration file from a default location.
For Windows this is at `%USER_PROFILE%\mosquitto_ctrl`. For other systems,
it will try `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mosquitto_ctrl` or
`$HOME/.config/mosquitto_ctrl`.

You may override this behaviour by manually specifying an options file with
`-o <path to options file>`.

The options file should contain a list of options, one per line, exactly as
they would be provided on the command line. For example:

```
--cafile /path/to/my/CA.crt
--certfile /path/to/my/client.crt
--keyfile /path/to/my/client.key
-u admin
-h mosquitto.example.com

```
#### mosquitto\_ctrl options

* `-A address` : Bind the outgoing connection to a local ip address/hostname.
  Use this argument if you need to restrict network communication to a
  particular interface.
* `--cafile path-to-ca.crt` : Define the path to a file containing PEM encoded
  CA certificates that are trusted. Used to enable SSL communication. See also
  `--capath`
* `--capath` : Define the path to a directory containing PEM encoded CA
  certificates that are trusted. Used to enable SSL communication. For
  `--capath` to work correctly, the certificate files must have ".crt" as the
  file ending and you must run `openssl rehash <path to capath>` each time you
  add/remove a certificate. See also `--cafile`.
* `--cert path-to-client.crt` : Define the path to a file containing a PEM
  encoded certificate for this client, if required by the server. See also
  `--key`.
* `--ciphers` : An openssl compatible list of TLS ciphers to support in the
  client. See ciphers(1) for more information.
* `-d` : Enable debug messages.
* `--help` : Display usage information.
* `-h hostname` : Specify the host to connect to. Defaults to localhost.
* `-i client-id` : The id to use for this client. If not given, a client id
  will be generated depending on the MQTT version being used. For v3.1.1/v3.1,
  the client generates a client id in the format mosq-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, where
  the X are replaced with random alphanumeric characters. For v5.0, the client
  sends a zero length client id, and the server will generate a client id for
  the client.
* `--insecure` : When using certificate based encryption, this option disables
  verification of the server hostname in the server certificate. This can be
  useful when testing initial server configurations but makes it possible for a
  malicious third party to impersonate your server through DNS spoofing, for
  example. Use this option in testing only. If you need to resort to using this
  option in a production environment, your setup is at fault and there is no
  point using encryption.
* `--key path-to-client.key` : Define the path to a file containing a PEM
  encoded private key for this client, if required by the server. See also
  `--cert`.
* `-L url` : Specify specify user, password, hostname, port and topic at once
  as a URL. The URL must be in the form:
  `mqtt(s)://[username[:password]@]host[:port]`. If the scheme is mqtt:// then
  the port defaults to 1883. If the scheme is mqtts:// then the port defaults
  to 8883.
* `--nodelay` : Disable Nagle's algorithm for the socket. This means that
  latency of sent messages is reduced, which is particularly noticable for
  small, reasonably infrequent messages. Using this option may result in more
  packets being sent than would normally be necessary.
* `-p port` : Connect to the port specified. If not given, the default of 1883
  for plain MQTT or 8883 for MQTT over TLS will be used.
* `-P password` : Provide a password to be used for authenticating with the
  broker. Using this argument without also specifying a username is invalid
  when using MQTT v3.1 or v3.1.1. See also the `-u` option.
* `--proxy proxy-url` : Specify a SOCKS5 proxy to connect through. "None" and
  "username" authentication types are supported. The socks-url must be of the
  form `socks5h://[username[:password]@]host[:port]`. The protocol prefix
  socks5h means that hostnames are resolved by the proxy. The symbols %25, %3A
  and %40 are URL decoded into %, : and @ respectively, if present in the
  username or password. If username is not given, then no authentication is
  attempted. If the port is not given, then the default of 1080 is used.
* `--psk key` : Provide the hexadecimal (no leading 0x) pre-shared-key matching
  the one used on the broker to use TLS-PSK encryption support.
  `--psk-identity` must also be provided to enable TLS-PSK.
* `--psk-identity identify` : The client identity to use with TLS-PSK support.
  This may be used instead of a username if the broker is configured to do so.
* `-q qos` : Specify the quality of service to use for messages, from 0, 1 and
* Defaults to 1.
* `--quiet` : If this argument is given, no runtime errors will be printed.
  This excludes any error messages given in case of invalid user input (e.g.
  using `-p` without a port).
* `--tls-version version` : Choose which TLS protocol version to use when
  communicating with the broker. Valid options are tlsv1.3, tlsv1.2 and
  tlsv1.1. The default value is tlsv1.2. Must match the protocol version used
  by the broker.
* `-u username` : Provide a username to be used for authenticating with the
  broker. See also the `-P` argument.
* `--unix path` : Connect to a broker through a local unix domain socket
  instead of a TCP socket. This is a replacement for `-h` and `-L`. For
  example: `mosquitto_ctrl --unix /tmp/mosquitto.sock ...`.
* `-V protocol-version` : Specify which version of the MQTT protocol should be
  used when connecting to the remote broker. Can be `5`, `311`, `31`, or the
  more verbose `mqttv5`, `mqttv311`, or `mqttv31`. Defaults to `311`.

### Configuring default access

The initial configuration sets the default ACL type behaviours to:

* `publishClientSend`: deny
* `publishClientReceive`: allow
* `subscribe`: deny
* `unsubscribe`: allow

If you wish to change these, use `mosquitto_ctrl`.

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec setDefaultACLAccess publishClientSend deny
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec setDefaultACLAccess publishClientReceive deny
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec setDefaultACLAccess subscribe deny
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec setDefaultACLAccess unsubscribe deny

```

You can examine the current default access with the `getDefaultACLAccess` command:

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec getDefaultACLAccess unsubscribe

```
### Creating and modifying clients

To create a new client:

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec createClient <username>

```

This creates a client which does not have a client id associated with it. You
will be asked for the password for the new client before you are asked for the
admin user password. Pay attention to the messages on the command line.

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec createClient <username> -i <client id>

```

This creates a client which has a client id associated with it.

To delete a client (clients connected with these credentials will be
disconnected from the broker):

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec deleteClient <username>

```

To disable a client (clients connected with these credentials will be
disconnected from the broker):

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec disableClient <username>

```

To enable a client (clients will be able to use these credentials to log in
again):

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec enableClient <username>

```

To set a client password:

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec setClientPassword <username>
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec setClientPassword <username> <password>

```

To add/remove a role to/from a client:

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec addClientRole <username> <rolename> <priority>
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec removeClientRole <username> <rolename>

```

To get information on a client:

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec getClient <username>

```

To list all clients:

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec listClients

```

The `modifyClient` command also exists in the topic API, but is not currently available in `mosquitto_ctrl`.

### Creating and modifying groups

To create a new group:

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec createGroup <groupname>

```

To delete a group:

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec deleteGroup <groupname>

```

To add/remove a client to/from a group:

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec addGroupClient <groupname> <username> <priority>
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec removeGroupClient <groupname> <username>

```

In this case the `priority` refers to the priority of the group within the
client's list of groups.

To add/remove a role to/from a group:

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec addGroupRole <groupname> <rolename> <priority>
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec removeGroupRole <groupname> <rolename>

```

To set/get the group that anonymous devices are assigned to:

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec setAnonymousGroup <groupname>
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec getAnonymousGroup

```

To get information on a group:

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec getGroup <groupname>

```

To list all groups:

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec listGroups

```

The `modifyGroup` command also exists in the topic API, but is not currently
available in `mosquitto_ctrl`.

### Creating and modifying roles

To create a new role:

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec createRole <rolename>

```

To delete a role:

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec deleteRole <rolename>

```

To add an ACL to a role:

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec addRoleACL <rolename> <acltype> <topic filter> allow|deny <priority>

```

Where `acltype` is one of `publishClientSend`, `publishClientReceive`,
`subscribeLiteral`, `subscribePattern`, `unsubscribeLiteral`, and
`unsubscribePattern`.

For example:

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec addRoleACL <rolename> publishClientSend client/topic allow 5

```

To remove an ACL from a role using the topic filter as the key:

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec removeRoleACL <rolename> <acltype> <topic filter>

```

For example:

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec removeRoleACL <rolename> publishClientSend client/topic

```

To get information on a role:

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec getRole <rolename>

```

To list all roles:

```
mosquitto_ctrl <options> dynsec listRoles

```

The `modifyRole` command also exists in the topic API, but is not currently
available in `mosquitto_ctrl`.

# [Bug 575324] Mosquitto broker with Dynamic Security Plugin may lead to access control failure

## Description

Dynamic Security Plugin is supported since Mosquitto 2.0, so this problem will affect version 2.0 and later.

Dynamic Security Plugin sets the default ACL type behaviours to:

* publishClientSend: deny\
* publishClientReceive: allow\
* subscribe: deny\
* unsubscribe: allow

Consider the following scenario:\

1. A tenant now have access to some topic like "message/state", and then he connect to broker with "cleanStart=False" and an enough "sessionInteval=10000"
2. The tenant subscribe the topic "message/state"
3. The tenant disconnect from the broker
4. Admin revoke the privilege from this tenant (subscribePattern message/state)
5. The tenant reconnect with "cleanStart=False" and his session will recover include subscription of "message/state" which means he doesn't need to send another "SUBSCRIBE" packet.
6. Because the default "publishClientReceive" is "allow", the tenant still can receive message from topic "message/state"

By the way, we can't update the default ACL with command like "mosquitto\_ctrl dynsec setDefaultACLAccess publishClientSend deny" when the broker is running. This could be a bug.

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 35 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [RPM-4.17](/wiki/Changes/RPM-4.17 "Changes/RPM-4.17")
* [IBus 1.5.25](/wiki/Changes/IBus_1.5.25 "Changes/IBus 1.5.25")
* [F35MingwEnvToolchainUpdate](/wiki/Changes/F35MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/F35MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")
* [golang1.17](/wiki/Changes/golang1.17 "Changes/golang1.17")
* [LLVM-13](/wiki/Changes/LLVM-13 "Changes/LLVM-13")

## Before the rebuild

```
- exclude GHC from the mass rebuild by updating the scripts before run.
- use rpmdevtools 9.5 for rpmautospec support

```

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, July 21st. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f35
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However, maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f35. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f35 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f35
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2020-07-21 10:00:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.
