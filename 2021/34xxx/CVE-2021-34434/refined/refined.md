{
  "cveId": "CVE-2021-34434",
  "related": true,
  "info": {
    "rootCause": "When using the dynamic security plugin, if the ability for a client to make subscriptions on a topic is revoked when a durable client is offline, then existing subscriptions for that client are not revoked.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Authorization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can retain subscription privileges after they have been revoked, allowing them to continue receiving messages on topics they should no longer have access to.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "A malicious or compromised client connects to the broker with cleanStart=False",
      "The malicious client subscribes to a topic.",
      "The client disconnects from the broker.",
      "The admin revokes the client's privilege to subscribe to the topic.",
      "The malicious client reconnects with cleanStart=False, and its session, including the subscription, is recovered."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to have a user account and be able to connect to the MQTT broker, with persistent sessions enabled (cleanStart=False). They also need to be aware of the topics they want to subscribe to before their privileges are revoked."
  }
