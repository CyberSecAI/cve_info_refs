The content describes two Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in taocms.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not implement CSRF protection mechanisms, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability when adding a new administrator account.
- CSRF vulnerability when changing an administrator's password.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can add a new administrator account with full privileges to the application.
- An attacker can change the password of an existing administrator account, potentially locking them out.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with embedded JavaScript.
- This page contains a form that sends a request to the vulnerable application's admin interface.
- When a logged-in administrator visits this page, the embedded JavaScript executes, sending the crafted request without the administrator's knowledge or consent.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host or deliver the malicious HTML page to a logged-in administrator.
- The attacker does not need to have direct access to the application server.

**Additional details:**
- The provided proof-of-concept (POC) HTML code for adding an administrator account sets the `auth_level` parameter to `admin`. It also sets a username and password for the new user.
- The POC for changing the administrator's password sets the `pwd` parameter to a new password value.
- The developer of the application claims there is logic in `admin/admin.php` that fixes the bug, but that claim is disputed by the original reporter of the vulnerability
