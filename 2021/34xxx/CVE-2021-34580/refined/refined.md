- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the application's behavior when handling invalid login attempts. Specifically, the server sends different responses depending on whether the username exists or not. This difference in responses allows an attacker to determine if a username is valid without needing valid credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Response Discrepancy Information Exposure (CWE-204): The system exposes information about the existence of users through different server responses for valid and invalid usernames during login attempts.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - User Enumeration: An attacker can identify valid usernames. This can facilitate further attacks such as brute-force attempts or targeted social engineering.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network: The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Unauthenticated: The attacker does not need any prior authentication or credentials.
    - Remote: The attacker can perform this attack from a remote location with network access to the affected service.
