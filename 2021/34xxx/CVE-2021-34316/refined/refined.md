- **User Interaction Required:** The vulnerability requires user interaction to be exploited. A user must open the malicious PDF file using the affected software (Siemens JT2Go or Teamcenter Visualization).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF file that triggers the out-of-bounds write.
- The attacker must convince a user to open the malicious PDF file with the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Siemens JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization products.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 13.2 of both JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization.
- The vulnerability was assigned ZDI-CAN-13380 by the Zero Day Initiative.
