Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-34648:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Ninja Forms plugin registered a REST API endpoint `/ninja-forms-submissions/email-action` to trigger email actions on form submissions.
*   The `permission_callback` function used to restrict access to this endpoint only checked if a user was logged in (`is_user_logged_in()`), without verifying if the user had the necessary capabilities to perform this action.
*   The `trigger_email_action` function, executed by the endpoint, constructs the email based on values passed in the request, allowing for arbitrary email content and recipients.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The `permission_callback` function only verifies if a user is logged in, not if they are authorized to trigger email actions, leading to privilege escalation.
*   **Email Injection:** The `trigger_email_action` function uses user-provided data to create email content, including the recipient, subject, and body, allowing for arbitrary email injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing:** Attackers can craft and send emails from the vulnerable site, potentially tricking users into performing unwanted actions (e.g., clicking malicious links, providing credentials), thereby leveraging the domain's trust.
*   **Spear Phishing:** Targeted attacks on site owners by sending emails that appear to originate from their own site, increasing the likelihood of success.
*   **Site Takeover:** Email injection vulnerability can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities, such as CSRF or XSS, to facilitate a site takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **REST API Endpoint:** The `/ninja-forms-submissions/email-action` endpoint is accessible to any authenticated user.
*   **Manipulated Request Data:** The attacker can send a POST request to the endpoint with crafted JSON data to control email content, recipients, and other settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid login to the WordPress site. This could be any user, even one with minimal permissions, since only being logged in is checked.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability arises from a lack of proper capability checks on a REST API endpoint within the Ninja Forms plugin. The plugin's use of a simple logged-in check allowed any authenticated user to trigger email actions and craft arbitrary emails by manipulating request parameters, leading to potential phishing attacks and other malicious activities.
