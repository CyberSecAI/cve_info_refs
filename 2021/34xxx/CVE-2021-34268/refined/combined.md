| **Describe the set-up**   * Software:   + STM32Cube MCU & MPU Packages * Version:   + STM32Cube\_FW\_H7\_V1.8.0 * Verification Hardware Platform:   + STM32H7B3   **Describe the bug**   * Function:    + static void USBH\_ParseDevDesc(USBH\_DevDescTypeDef \*dev\_desc, uint8\_t \*buf, uint16\_t length) * Location:    + [STM32CubeH7/Middlewares/ST/STM32\_USB\_Host\_Library/Core/Src/usbh\_ctlreq.c](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/blob/79196b09acfb720589f58e93ccf956401b18a191/Middlewares/ST/STM32_USB_Host_Library/Core/Src/usbh_ctlreq.c#L355)  Line 355     in     [79196b0](/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/commit/79196b09acfb720589f58e93ccf956401b18a191)           |  | dev\_desc->bMaxPacketSize = \*(uint8\_t \*)(buf + 7); |     | --- | --- | * Type:    + Denial-of-Service. * Result:    + A malformed USB device packet may cause the system to hang when it tries to communicate with the outside world. * Description:    + The function USBH\_ParseDevDesc() parses the device descriptor by input data from a USB device.   + The valid max packet size of the device descriptor should be 8, 16, 32, and 64 as USB specification required. However, the function USBH\_ParseDevDesc() doesn’t check the value of dev\_desc->bMaxPacketSize as shown in       [STM32CubeH7/Middlewares/ST/STM32\_USB\_Host\_Library/Core/Src/usbh\_ctlreq.c](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/blob/79196b09acfb720589f58e93ccf956401b18a191/Middlewares/ST/STM32_USB_Host_Library/Core/Src/usbh_ctlreq.c#L355)  Line 355     in     [79196b0](/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/commit/79196b09acfb720589f58e93ccf956401b18a191)           |  | dev\_desc->bMaxPacketSize = \*(uint8\_t \*)(buf + 7); |     | --- | --- |                    . The variable dev\_desc->bMaxPacketSize will be used as the size to construct the control pipe between host and device as shown in       [STM32CubeH7/Middlewares/ST/STM32\_USB\_Host\_Library/Core/Src/usbh\_core.c](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/blob/79196b09acfb720589f58e93ccf956401b18a191/Middlewares/ST/STM32_USB_Host_Library/Core/Src/usbh_core.c#L828)  Line 828     in     [79196b0](/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/commit/79196b09acfb720589f58e93ccf956401b18a191)           |  | phost->Control.pipe\_size = phost->device.DevDesc.bMaxPacketSize; |     | --- | --- |                    . If bMaxPacketSize is zero, the firmware will get the error status USBH\_FAIL in the function USBH\_HandleControl() called by the function USBH\_CtlReq() when trying to communicate with the outside world by IN and OUT pipe in the future and the host will try to re-enumerate. This process will loop again and again.   **How To Reproduce**   1. Running MSC\_Standalone application on the STM32H7B3I platform 2. Plug a USB disk 3. Use the attached Bug1.txt to replace the USB device packet. [Bug1.txt](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/files/5381197/Bug1.txt)   **Additional context**   * To patch it, the program should check if dev\_desc->bMaxPacketSize is equal to 8, 16, 32 or 64. At least, it should be greater than zero. |

| Hi [@TheSilentDawn](https://github.com/TheSilentDawn),  Thank you for your interest in our products and software solutions. Thank you also for this report and for all the other ones. They will be transmitted to our development teams for analysis.  However, may I first ask you whether these cases you are reporting (or at least some of them) are real error cases you faced while using our library or simulated test cases you designed based on a code review? Thank you in advance for your answer.  With regards, |

| Hi, [@ALABSTM](https://github.com/ALABSTM), All the vulnerabilities reported are discovered by the research work of our team. We are building an automatic method to find the bugs. And all the testcases are checked manually before reporting to make sure it could be leveraged by the attackers. Also, these vulnerabilities could be patched as described in the **Addition context** part. Could you please share an email? When our paper is ready for submission, I will let you know and share the draft with you asap. Thanks for your help.^\_^ |

| [@ALABSTM](https://github.com/ALABSTM) [@CCASTM](https://github.com/CCASTM) [@Tombana](https://github.com/Tombana) [@RKOUSTM](https://github.com/RKOUSTM) Hello Sir/Madam,  I'm a Ph.D. student from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Georgia. We are working on a fuzzing tool for automatic bug discovery. In the past year, I have reported several bugs that influence the MCU product line of STMicroelectronics. Some other STMicroelectronics engineers and your team have confirmed with us and the reported bugs have been patched. Currently, we are working on a research paper that systematically describes our new method. I wonder if your team can help apply for CVE IDs for these bugs so that we can refer to these CVE IDs and state our responsible disclosure with confidence.  Thanks for your help. If you want, we can also send you a draft of our paper before submission so that you can check whether the wording is appropriate. Below is a list of relevant bugs we reported.  [STM PLC] <https://community.st.com/s/question/0D53W00000BKF70SAH/stmplc-bug1> <https://community.st.com/s/question/0D53W00000BKF7PSAX/stmplc-bug2> <https://community.st.com/s/question/0D53W00000BKF7QSAX/stmplc-bug3> <https://community.st.com/s/question/0D53W00000BKF8rSAH/stmplc-bug4> <https://community.st.com/s/question/0D53W00000BKF8sSAH/stmplc-bug5> <https://community.st.com/s/question/0D53W00000BKF9uSAH/stmplc-bug6> <https://community.st.com/s/question/0D53W00000BKGAMSA5/stmplc-bug7> <https://community.st.com/s/question/0D53W00000BKGANSA5/stmplc-bug8> <https://community.st.com/s/question/0D53W00000BKGJWSA5/stmplc-bug9> [STM32 SDK USB Driver] [#75](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/issues/75) [#76](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/issues/76) [#77](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/issues/77) [#78](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/issues/78) [#79](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/issues/79) [#80](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/issues/80) [#81](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/issues/81) [#82](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/issues/82) [#83](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/issues/83) [#84](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/issues/84)  We look forwards to your reply.

| Hello [@TheSilentDawn](https://github.com/TheSilentDawn),  You request will be reported to our development team to see whether it is possible to address it. However, as the PLC-related list of posts on the ST Community has not been confirmed yet, I can only formulate the request for the USB-related list you reported on this repository. I will keep you informed should there be any news.  Please try to contact the ST Community administrators to ask for a feedback about the PLC-related list of potential vulnerabilities.
