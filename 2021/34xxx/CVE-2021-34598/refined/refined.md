- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The remote logging functionality lacks memory release for data structures from `syslog-ng` when remote logging is active.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Resource Shutdown or Release (CWE-401) / Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (CWE-770)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a high number of events to be logged, leading to a system restart.
- **Attack vectors:** Network. The vulnerability is triggered when remote logging is activated and a high number of log events are generated.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to generate a high number of log events. No specific authentication is mentioned in relation to this attack, the attacker could be external as the CVSS metric has "PR:N" (Privileges Required: None).
