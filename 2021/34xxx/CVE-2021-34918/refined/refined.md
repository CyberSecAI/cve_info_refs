{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists within the parsing of JP2 files. Crafted data in a JP2 file can trigger a write past the end of an allocated buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
     "attack_vectors": "The target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file (JP2 file).",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted JP2 file that triggers the out-of-bounds write during parsing. User interaction is needed to open the malicious file."
