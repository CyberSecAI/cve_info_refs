- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect bounds check in NVIDIA OTE protocol message parsing code present in all Trusty TAs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** An incorrect bounds check can allow a local user to access memory from the heap in the TrustZone.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** A local user can exploit this vulnerability through a malicious client.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to run a malicious client. The user also needs to trigger the vulnerable code path by sending a specially crafted OTE message.
