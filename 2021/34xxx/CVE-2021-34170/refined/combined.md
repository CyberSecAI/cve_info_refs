# Potential PC Security Exploit Spreading

[PSA](/r/darksouls3/?f=flair_name%3A%22PSA%22)

Edit: I would highly encourage anyone who has been affected by the new game hack to submit a support ticket. Unfortunately you have to make a bamco account now for NA support, but on the bright side that process is very quick. [Here](https://support.bandainamcoent.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for north america.

The EU support site has an option for submitting a ticket without an account [Here](https://service-en.bandainamcoent.eu/app/ask/p/6892). Please be kind to the support people. They escalate tickets at the end of every month properly, it's higher ups in bamco that deserve your ire. If you have video footage of what happened include that. It'd take a *lot* of people complaining for bamco to prod fromsoft about it.

Recently a hack was leaked which has the potential for much worse than the previous "item send" meme. It can be used to alter other player's game data and potentially lock them out of their save among a host of other things like changing your NG. (needless to say banning players is among one of those things but being sent to ng is *not* a guaranteed ban)

Edit: This is because of a packet that allows you to tell other people's games *any* progression flag is changing. People have figured out more nuanced uses now so you could say run into an invader while doing a playthrough then they leave/die/kill you normally but the next time you warp to firelink suddenly the coiled sword isn't embedded anymore, or all your NPCs are aggroed/dead. This edit is just to make sure people understand it won't always be noticeable immediately.

*Double edit: people are able to do this hack to you while starting to invade you from their world. So if you get hit by it seemingly randomly someone probably started to invade you from their world, sent the hack then didn't have to actually enter your world*

## Future of Ds3 Vulnerabilities/Arbitrary Code Execution

However hacking in dark souls 3 (and games that share its engine) has the potential to not stay in a state only affecting your game and be explored further to the point of using the game to run custom code on your machine. This vulnerability has been verified privately by the developer of the blue sentinel mod and was disclosed to bandai namco several years ago. A google document about various dark souls 3 vulnerabilities by the blue sentinel developer can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10__a-e0RF_6_IrImzvuoiR4fKtMu1vVdXOmh_AGnt38/edit?usp=drivesdk)

The [Blue Sentinel](https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/723) anticheat mod had both the event packet exploit and arbitrary code execution patched as early as its beta releases. When running BS it monitors incoming network information in the ds3 process before it reaches your game so when malicious network packets get detected by blue sentinel it denies it from ever being accepted by the actual game.

If you've already been affected to the point of locking your save your safest options are really to either reload a backup or make a new save and then use the [Honest merchant](https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/607) mod to quickly create a character.

Alternatively you could try to use CE to unscrew your character but your mileage will vary and you won't find support for that on this sub.

Edit: ah forgot the sub rules say no *malicious* cheating now. In that case you can try unlocking all bonfires after having a ng cycle broken or using bonfirewarp to high wall to get your saves unstuck. This should fix some current meme usages.

Edit: Begrudgingly I will add that [pyreprotecc](https://github.com/0dm/PyreProtecc) will also protect against save bricking in the next update. Two people in Pyre's server are the source for this now irreversible spread of save bricking though sooo. :/

I suppose I really need to make this more explicit: the RCE vulnerabilities are separate from the progression flag hack that the shitters in Pyre's server decided to spread. Blue sentinel patches both the progression flag hack and several RCE vulnerabilities
