  "CVE-2021-34428": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A `SessionListener#sessionDestroyed()` method exception can prevent a session from being invalidated which breaks logout functionality in Jetty. In clustered sessions and multiple contexts, this can lead to a session not being invalidated and an application on a shared computer being left logged in.",
    "root_cause": "If an exception is thrown within the `SessionListener#sessionDestroyed()` method, the session ID is not invalidated in the session ID manager.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Session ID is not invalidated when exceptions occur in the `SessionListener#sessionDestroyed()` method.",
        "An `IllegalStateException` may be thrown by `getLastAccessedTime()` within `sessionDestroyed()` call, causing an exception to be thrown."
    ],
    "impact": "A session may not be invalidated, leaving an application used on a shared computer logged in. In clustered sessions and multiple contexts, this may result in a session not being invalidated.",
    "attack_vector": "Physical",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs an application to throw an exception, no known path to induce the exception directly.",
    "additional_details": "The application should catch all Throwables within their SessionListener#sessionDestroyed() implementations.  The applicationâ€™s `getLastAccessedTime()` may throw an `IllegalStateException` if called within `sessionDestroyed()`."
