- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data in the `AppStudioUploadHandler` class, leading to arbitrary file uploads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file upload vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of NETWORK SERVICE.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Although authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Commvault CommCell server.
