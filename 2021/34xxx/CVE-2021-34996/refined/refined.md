- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies within the `Demo_ExecuteProcessOnGroup` workflow, where an attacker can specify an arbitrary command to be executed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The Commvault CommCell has an exposed function within the `Demo_ExecuteProcessOnGroup` workflow that allows arbitrary command execution. Also, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected Commvault CommCell installation with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is network-based. By creating a malicious workflow, an attacker can specify an arbitrary command to be executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the Commvault CommCell. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.
