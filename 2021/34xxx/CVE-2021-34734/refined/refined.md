```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Improper management of memory resources, specifically a double free condition in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) implementation.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Double-free vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- Attack vectors: Sending crafted LLDP packets to an affected device.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker must be in the same broadcast domain (Layer 2 adjacent) as the affected device. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
