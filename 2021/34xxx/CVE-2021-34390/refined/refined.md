Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2021-34390:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the NVIDIA TLK (Trusty Linux Kernel) function.
- Specifically, a lack of checks allows the exploitation of an integer overflow.
- This integer overflow occurs through a specific SMC (System Management Call) that is triggered by a user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Integer overflow vulnerability in the `tz_map_shared_mem` function, exploitable through a specific SMC call.
- Lack of proper bounds checking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attacker.
- Requires a user-triggered SMC call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the specific SMC call that exploits the integer overflow.
- User interaction is required.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided text includes CVSS v3.1 vector which is AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H.
- The exploit has a proof of concept (E:P) available.
- There is a confirmation that the vulnerability is not fixed (RL:X) and that the fix is complete (RC:C).
