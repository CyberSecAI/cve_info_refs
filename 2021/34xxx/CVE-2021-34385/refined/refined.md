- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An integer overflow occurs during the calculation of a length, leading to a heap overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow, heap overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Exploitation can lead to information disclosure, data tampering, and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access, exploitation of the vulnerability via specific SMC calls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local user with high privileges and the ability to trigger specific SMC calls. The attacker needs to have the ability to trigger a user-triggered function, and needs user interaction to perform the attack.
