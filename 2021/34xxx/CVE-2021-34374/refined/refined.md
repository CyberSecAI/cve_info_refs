- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of input buffer length verification in command handlers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption due to insufficient validation of input buffer lengths.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation can lead to information disclosure, escalation of privileges, and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access with high privileges and user interaction is required.
