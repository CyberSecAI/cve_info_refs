> **CVE ID:** **[CVE-2021-34666](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-34666)**

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The plugin is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient input sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The plugin directly uses user-supplied input from the `add` parameter found in the `~/wp_sidebarMenu.php` file without proper sanitization or encoding.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page, which will be executed in the browsers of users who access a crafted link containing the malicious payload. This can allow the attacker to steal session cookies, redirect the user to malicious websites, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted URL, where the `add` parameter contains malicious JavaScript. The victim would need to be lured into accessing the malicious URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing the XSS payload and trick a user into accessing it. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**

*   The content explicitly mentions that the vulnerability is due to the direct use of user supplied input.
*   It also mentions that the vulnerability is a reflected XSS, meaning that the malicious script is not stored but instead executed directly.
*   There is no mention of a patch for this vulnerability, and the recommendation is to uninstall the plugin.
