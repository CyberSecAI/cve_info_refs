{
  "vulnerability_report": {
    "root_cause": "The `mb`, `mh`, and `mw` commands in the NuttShell (NSH) allow reading arbitrary memory locations, enabling extraction of firmware from flash memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of access control on memory read commands.",
      "Ability to bypass hardware read protection mechanisms.",
      "Exposure of firmware code and potential intellectual property."
    ],
    "impact": "Extraction of firmware binary code, reverse engineering, and intellectual property theft.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Serial connection to the target device, using NSH shell access.",
      "Exploitation of the `mb`, `mh`, or `mw` commands with a specified memory address"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Physical or remote access to a device with NSH enabled.",
      "Basic knowledge of memory layout and firmware storage locations.",
      "Ability to execute commands in the NSH shell."
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass ST's hardware read protection and extract firmware even when such protections are in place. The identified vulnerability was found in a commercial drone vendor where the firmware was protected using ST's hardware read protection but was still read by using NSH's memory access command.\n The provided PoC script demonstrated how to extract firmware over serial by reading memory using 'mw' command."
