  "vulnerability": {
    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit PDF Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of the delay property. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of validation of the existence of an object before operations are performed on it, specifically when handling the delay property within XFA documents.",
    "vulnerability": "Use-After-Free",
    "impact": "Remote code execution in the context of the current process.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited by getting the target user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF file that leverages the vulnerability.",
