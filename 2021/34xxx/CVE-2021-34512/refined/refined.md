    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. The specific flaw exists within the storport.sys driver. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before allocating a buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.",
