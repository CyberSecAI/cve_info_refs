Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-34393:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the TSEC TA (Trusted Secure Execution Console Trusted Application) of the Trusty OS. The TSEC TA deserializes incoming messages even though it does not expose any command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper deserialization of messages within the TSEC TA, despite not exposing any commands, which can be exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can exploit the deserializer, potentially leading to code execution and information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local (AV:L).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access with high privileges (PR:H), and must be able to trigger the vulnerability through user interaction (UI:R).

**Summary**
The vulnerability resides in the TSEC Trusted Application within the Trusty OS. The TSEC TA deserializes messages, even when it doesn't expose any commands, and this can be exploited by a local privileged attacker, potentially leading to code execution and information disclosure.
