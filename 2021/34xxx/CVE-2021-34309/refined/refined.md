Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-34309:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the `Tiff_loader.dll` library lacking proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing TIFF files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. Specifically, a malformed TIFF file can cause the library to write data past the end of an allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process. This means an attacker could potentially gain full control over the application and the user's system running the affected software.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malicious TIFF file. An attacker would need to trick a user into opening a specially crafted TIFF file using the vulnerable software.
- The advisory also mentions that user interaction is required, specifying the target must open a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to deliver a malicious TIFF file to the victim and entice them to open it with the vulnerable software.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system beforehand.
