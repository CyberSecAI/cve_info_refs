## Description

An issue was discovered in CubeCoders AMP before 2.1.1.8. A lack of validation of the Java Version setting means that an unintended executable path can be set. The result is that high-privileged users can trigger code execution.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| This was originally reported to us privately by Joel Frederick-Lewis - [CVE-2021-34539](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vp24-gcm3-2g97 "CVE-2021-34539") This issue exists for record keeping and disclosure purposes. Bug ReportSystem Information  * Windows, Linux * 10/06/2021 B2 * Development  I confirm:  * that I have searched for an existing bug report for this issue. * that I am using the latest available version of AMP. * that my operating system is up-to-date.  Symptoms The 'Java Version' setting within AMP doesn't validate its setting in the way you'd expect for a potentially sensitive setting. AMP could be tricked by a malicious user (albeit one who already has a high level of access to the system) into running code that it shouldn't. Reproduction Alter the path to Java by using the Inspect Element tool in a browser for a given setting. Notes Because of the authentication and permissions requirements (users with this combination would reasonably be expected to have a high level of access to the host) this is regarded as a low risk, but potentially high impact issue. Instances running inside Docker aren't affected in the same way since they would not affect the host system.  The issue was reported on 10/06/2021 and a fix was released the same day. |
