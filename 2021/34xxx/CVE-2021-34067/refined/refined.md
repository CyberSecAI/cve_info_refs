Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2021-34067 Analysis:**

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `BitStreamWriter::flushBits()` function. This occurs due to incorrect handling of bitstream writing, specifically when updating the frame per second (FPS) of a non-HEVC stream.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The `BitStreamWriter::flushBits()` function writes beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.
- **Incorrect HEVC stream detection:** The code attempts to parse a stream as HEVC even when it doesn't conform to the standard, which leads to out-of-bounds writes during the bitstream manipulation for fps updating..

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The heap-buffer-overflow leads to a program crash, as demonstrated by the AddressSanitizer output provided.
- **Potential for Code Execution:** While the provided data only shows a crash, such vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can carefully control the memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously crafted input:** An attacker can provide a specially crafted input file that is not a valid HEVC stream, causing the program to misinterpret the data, leading to the buffer overflow during the attempt to update the FPS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide input files:** The attacker needs the ability to provide an input file to the tsMuxer program.
- **No special privileges needed:** The vulnerability can be triggered by an unprivileged user.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided data contains the AddressSanitizer output showing the exact location of the heap-buffer-overflow.
- The issue is triggered within the `HevcUnit::updateBits()` which is called when trying to update the FPS for non-HEVC stream. This update of the HEVC stream is done by the `HEVCStreamReader::updateStreamFps` and `MPEGStreamReader::updateFPS` functions.
- The fix involves adding a check early in the parsing process to determine if the stream conforms to the HEVC standard and avoid processing it further if it doesn't, preventing the overflow.
- The patch was implemented in commit `d77ed5e8dc701f64ed5da317b896879e621de865` which included a fix for issue #422.
- Issue #424 is related to this same heap-buffer-overflow in `BitStreamWriter::flushBits()` and was fixed by the same commit.
