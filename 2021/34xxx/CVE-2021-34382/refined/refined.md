Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-34382:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `tz_map_shared_mem` function of the NVIDIA TLK kernel in Trusty. An integer overflow occurs on the size parameter passed to this function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Integer overflow in the size parameter of the `tz_map_shared_mem` function.
*   The integer overflow leads to a buffer overflow, impacting both the request and logging buffers.
*   This allows for arbitrary writes to memory within the kernel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Arbitrary writes to kernel memory.
*   Potential for denial of service (DoS).
*   Potential for information disclosure.
*   Potential for data tampering.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local access is required to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is triggered through the `tz_map_shared_mem` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs local access to the affected device.
*   The attacker must be able to trigger the vulnerable `tz_map_shared_mem` function with a crafted size parameter.
*   A user with low privileges is sufficient, though the user interface requires user interaction.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document states that this vulnerability is present in the Trusty TLK.
*   The provided CVSS vector is `AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`, indicating that the attack requires local access, has a high complexity, low privilege, user interaction required, and the scope is unchanged, with high impacts to confidentiality, integrity and availability.
*   The document also specifies that the vulnerability has a proof-of-concept exploit, but no workarounds or fixes available at the time of this bulletin.
