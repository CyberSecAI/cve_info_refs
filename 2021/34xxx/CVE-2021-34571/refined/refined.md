Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Enbra EWM software, used to read data from Enbra meters with AT-WMBUS-16-2 radio modules, does not allow users to configure the encryption key.
*   The meters use a hardcoded cryptographic key for Wireless M-Bus Security mode 5 (shared AES key). The software is able to decrypt and parse messages because it uses this key or a derived version of it.
*   This hardcoded key is likely shared among multiple meters or derived from the meter number, allowing any user with the software to decrypt data from nearby meters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the use of a hardcoded cryptographic key in the meters and potentially in the Enbra EWM software.
*   **Lack of Key Management:** There is no option to configure or change the encryption key, meaning that a single key is used across multiple devices.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The system does not protect sensitive data transmitted wirelessly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can passively intercept and decrypt messages transmitted by the meters, gaining access to all the information available in the Enbra EWM software. This includes data such as water consumption patterns, potentially revealing the absence of occupants in a building, and potentially identifying specific devices.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** If the hardcoded key is discovered by an attacker, it could be used to reconfigure the meter (change keys, tamper with data, security events). This is more of a potential threat, as it is unclear if the keys can be used for this.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Proximity-Based:** The attacker needs to be within the radio range of the meters (tens of meters, potentially more with a better antenna).
*   **Passive Eavesdropping:** The attacker only needs to intercept the wireless communication; no interaction with the meters is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Proximity:** An attacker must be within radio range of the targeted meters.
*   **Access to Enbra EWM Software:** The attacker needs access to the Enbra EWM software and a compatible reader (e.g., a Wireless M-Bus USB dongle).
*   **No Special Privileges:** The attack doesn't require any special privileges on the targeted system.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attack is passive and does not require any user interaction on the victim's end.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document suggests that the encryption key might be a common key, a set of keys, or derived from the meter number or other data sent in plain text.
*   The document provides additional reading about Wireless M-Bus security.
*   The document suggests that forcing Enbra to change the keys or releasing the encryption key and information on how to change them would resolve this issue.
