- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow through a specific SMC (Secure Monitor Call) triggered by the user in the NVIDIA TLK (Trusty Linux Kernel) function due to a lack of checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow leading to a potential denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access. The vulnerability is triggered by a specific SMC call that can be initiated by a user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the system and be able to trigger the specific SMC call.
