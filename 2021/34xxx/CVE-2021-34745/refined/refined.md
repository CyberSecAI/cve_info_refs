- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The AppDynamics .NET Agent Coordinator Service executes code with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper privilege management. The .NET Agent Coordinator Service runs with SYSTEM privileges, allowing an attacker to exploit this to gain elevated privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with local access to a device running the vulnerable agent can create a custom process that is launched with SYSTEM privileges, enabling arbitrary command execution on the underlying operating system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to a device running the vulnerable agent is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have an authenticated, local user account on a Windows system with a vulnerable version of the AppDynamics .NET Agent installed.
