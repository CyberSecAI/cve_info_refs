    "summary": "The 2Way VideoCalls and Random Chat â€“ HTML5 Webcam Videochat WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the `vws_notice` function found in the ~/inc/requirements.php file which allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 5.2.7.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The plugin is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the `vws_notice` function in the `~/inc/requirements.php` file, which outputs the unsanitized input in the page.",

        "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the page, which will then execute in the victim's browser when the page is viewed. This could result in session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting the victim to a malicious website.",
        "attack_vectors": [
            "The attack vector involves a malicious link or crafted HTTP request which will cause the plugin to echo the unsanitized payload."
