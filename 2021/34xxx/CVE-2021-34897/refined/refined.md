Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies within the parsing of DGN (Design) files by Bentley View and MicroStation software. Crafted, malicious data within a DGN file can trigger a write past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The software attempts to write data beyond the boundaries of an allocated memory buffer. This occurs due to improper handling of specially crafted data within DGN files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This can lead to complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious DGN File: The primary attack vector is through opening a maliciously crafted DGN file.
- User Interaction: Exploitation requires user interaction, as the target user needs to open the malicious DGN file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious DGN file with specific crafted data.
- The attacker needs to deliver this file to the victim user.
- The victim user needs to open the crafted file using the vulnerable software.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
- Bentley has released an update (version 10.16.02.* and later) to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in versions of Bentley View and MicroStation prior to 10.16.02.*
- This CVE is part of a group of vulnerabilities (BE-2021-0009) affecting the same products.
