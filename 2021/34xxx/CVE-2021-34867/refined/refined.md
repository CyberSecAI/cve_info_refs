Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-34867

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the Parallels Desktop Toolgate component, leading to an uncontrolled memory allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Uncontrolled memory allocation due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code within the context of the hypervisor. This could lead to a complete compromise of the guest system, and potentially the host system as well, depending on the hypervisor's capabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attack vector. An attacker must have the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have obtained the ability to execute high-privileged code on the guest operating system. This suggests that the vulnerability is not directly exploitable from a low-privilege user context. The attacker needs to have already achieved some degree of access to the target system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in the Toolgate component of Parallels Desktop.
- Parallels has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to Parallels on 2021-04-16, and a coordinated public release of the advisory was made on 2021-09-08.
- ZDI-CAN-13672 is associated with this vulnerability.
