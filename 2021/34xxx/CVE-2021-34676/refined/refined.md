Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**
- Missing access control checks in the `export_csv` plugin handler of the NEX-Forms WordPress plugin. The plugin fails to verify if the user is authenticated before allowing access to exported Excel reports.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** Unauthenticated users can access exported Excel reports by sending a request with the `export_csv` GET parameter set to `true`.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The plugin exposes the Excel reports directly through a predictable URL parameter without proper authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can obtain sensitive or personally identifiable information submitted through the forms. This includes any data collected by the forms, such as names, addresses, contact information, or any other data that users input.
- **Privacy Violation:** User data and privacy are compromised due to the unauthorized access to form submission data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by making a GET request to any backend endpoint with the `export_csv` parameter set to `true`. No prior authentication is required for the request to be successful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials or access to the WordPress backend, only the knowledge of the vulnerable GET parameter.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site hosting the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects NEX-Forms versions 7.8.7 and earlier.
- **Fix:** The vulnerability was addressed in version 7.8.8 of the plugin.

This information aligns with the description of CVE-2021-34676, which describes an authentication bypass vulnerability in the NEX-Forms WordPress plugin.
