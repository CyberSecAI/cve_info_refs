{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the parsing of JT files, where crafted data can trigger a write past the end of an allocated buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds write"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves opening a maliciously crafted JT file using an affected version of Bentley View or MicroStation. User interaction is required in that the target must open the malicious file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious JT file. The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious file."
