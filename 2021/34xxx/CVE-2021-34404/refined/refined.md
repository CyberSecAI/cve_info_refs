Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-34404:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Boot ROM (BROM) of Android images for T210 provided by NVIDIA.
- The issue is caused by a failure to limit access to AHB-DMA (Advanced High-performance Bus Direct Memory Access) when BROM fails.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper access control to AHB-DMA during a BROM failure scenario.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS).
-  The attacker can impact the integrity and confidentiality of the system, extending beyond the security scope of BROM.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Physical access to the device is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have unprivileged physical access to the device.
- The attacker does not require any specific user interface interaction (UI:N) and does not need any privileges (PR:N).
- The attack complexity is high (AC:H) as specific conditions are required to trigger the BROM failure and then use AHB-DMA.
- The scope is changed due to impact beyond BROM.
