Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-34856:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `virtio-gpu` virtual device in Parallels Desktop.
*   The core issue is a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which leads to a memory corruption condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Memory corruption due to insufficient input validation.
*   This vulnerability is a privilege escalation flaw.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code within the hypervisor's context. This means the attacker can gain control of the host system from within the guest VM.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack is local, requiring the attacker to have the ability to execute code within the guest operating system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must already have high-privileged code execution within the guest operating system before they can trigger the vulnerability and escalate to hypervisor-level privileges. This is considered a local privilege escalation vulnerability.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to Parallels on July 30, 2021, and a coordinated public release of the advisory occurred on August 3, 2021.
*   Parallels has released an update to address this flaw, as noted in the Parallels KB article. The advisory from ZDI lists the CVE and provides a link to the NVD entry for more details.
