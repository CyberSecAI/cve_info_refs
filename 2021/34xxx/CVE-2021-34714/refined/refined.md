    "Metadata": {
      "Official Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
      "Content Analysis": "This CVE relates to a vulnerability in the Unidirectional Link Detection (UDLD) feature across multiple Cisco operating systems, including Cisco FXOS Software, Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, and Cisco NX-OS Software. The vulnerability stems from improper input validation of UDLD packets, which can be exploited by an adjacent, unauthenticated attacker sending crafted packets. Successful exploitation can lead to device reload, causing a denial-of-service condition. It's important to note that UDLD is disabled by default and the exploit requires strict conditions, notably full control of a directly connected device. On Cisco IOS XR devices, the impact is limited to the reload of the UDLD process. No workarounds are available.",
