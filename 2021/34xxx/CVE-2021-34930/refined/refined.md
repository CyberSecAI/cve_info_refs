Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-34930:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of JT files within Bentley View. Specifically, crafted data in a JT file can trigger a read past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability: The software reads beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can execute code in the context of the current process (Bentley View). This allows for a wide range of malicious actions on the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious JT file: An attacker crafts a JT file containing specific data that triggers the vulnerability.
- User interaction: The victim must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted JT file to the user, either by hosting on a website or sending the file directly.
- No specific position is mentioned, the attacker can be remote.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Bentley View and likely other MicroStation-based applications.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of JT files.
- Trend Micro ZDI discovered the vulnerability.
- Bentley released updates to address this issue.
