Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-34762:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation of the HTTPS URL within the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal issue. The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to manipulate the HTTPS URL to include directory traversal character sequences (e.g., `../`)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Access:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the affected device.
*   **Arbitrary File Write:** A successful exploit also allows an attacker to write arbitrary files to the affected device.
*   **Confidentiality and Integrity:** The impact includes a loss of confidentiality and integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability remotely via the web-based management interface.
*   **Crafted HTTPS Request:** The attacker sends a specifically crafted HTTPS request containing directory traversal character sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to have valid device credentials (i.e., be an authenticated user) to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to reach the web-based management interface of the affected device.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 8.1, classified as "High" severity. The vector string is: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N`
*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects devices running vulnerable versions of Cisco FMC Software.
*   **Unaffected Products:** Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software are confirmed not vulnerable.
*  **No Workarounds**: There are no workarounds available to address the vulnerability.
*   **Fixed Software**: Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability.
* **Discovered By**: The vulnerability was found by Brandon Sakai of Cisco during internal security testing.
*   **Public Disclosure**: The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
