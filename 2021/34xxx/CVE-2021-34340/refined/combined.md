| Hi, there.  There is a segmentation fault in the newest master branch [04aee52](https://github.com/libming/libming/commit/04aee52363688426eab74f5d6180c149654a6473). Here is the reproducing command:  ``` swftophp poc  ```  POC: [seg-decompile1640.zip](https://github.com/libming/libming/files/5123144/seg-decompile1640.zip)  Here is the reproduce trace reported by ASAN:  ``` ==79767==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address 0x000000000010 (pc 0x00000042782c bp 0x0000000000f0 sp 0x7ffdbd64ccf0 T0)     #0 0x42782b in decompileINCR_DECR ../../util/decompile.c:1640     #1 0x44e234 in decompileActions ../../util/decompile.c:3535     #2 0x44e234 in decompile5Action ../../util/decompile.c:3558     #3 0x4114d9 in outputSWF_INITACTION ../../util/outputscript.c:1860     #4 0x402836 in readMovie ../../util/main.c:281     #5 0x402836 in main ../../util/main.c:354     #6 0x7fd557eb582f in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x2082f)     #7 0x403b38 in _start (/mnt/data/playground/libming/build/util/swftophp+0x403b38)  AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info. SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: SEGV ../../util/decompile.c:1640 decompileINCR_DECR ==79767==ABORTING  ```  The cause might due to the incomplete check related to the index for array regs.
