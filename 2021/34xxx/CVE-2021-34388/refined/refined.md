- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A potential heap overflow in NVIDIA TegraBoot.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer leading to a heap overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can control all the RAM after the heap block, leading to denial of service or code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs local access to the device.
