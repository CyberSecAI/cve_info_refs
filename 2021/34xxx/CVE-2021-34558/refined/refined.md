Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the CVE-2021-34558 vulnerability:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly references CVE-2021-34558 and its official description: "golang: crypto/tls: certificate of wrong type is causing TLS client to panic." This confirms the content's relevance to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a type check failure in the `crypto/tls` package of Go. Specifically, the TLS client code assumes that the type of the public key in an X.509 certificate matches the expected type for the negotiated cipher suite. This assumption is incorrect, and when a certificate with an unexpected public key type is provided for RSA-based key exchanges, the client panics.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect type assertion:** The vulnerability lies in the TLS client’s handling of X.509 certificates. The code directly casts the certificate’s public key to `*rsa.PublicKey` without ensuring it matches the cipher suite's expected type.
- **Lack of input validation:**  The client fails to perform adequate input validation on the certificate's public key type before attempting to use it in key exchange, resulting in a panic if the type is wrong

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploitation leads to a client-side panic, causing the client application to terminate. This results in a denial of service.
- **Privileged Network Position Required:** An attacker needs a privileged position on the network to intercept and modify the TLS handshake.
- **Requirement for a valid certificate:** The attacker doesn't need the server's private key, but does require a trusted ECDSA or Ed25519 certificate for the targeted server. In scenarios where the InsecureSkipVerify setting is used, any valid certificate will trigger the panic.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** The attack vector involves intercepting and modifying a TLS handshake between a client and server.
- **Malicious TLS Server:** The attacker can act as a malicious TLS server providing a certificate with a public key of an incorrect type for the negotiated parameters

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Privileged network position:** The attacker must be able to intercept and modify the TLS handshake between the client and server. This is needed to inject the malicious certificate.
- **Certificate Generation/Acquisition:** The attacker does not require the private key of the server certificate but needs to have or be able to issue a trusted ECDSA or Ed25519 certificate for the server, or the client configured with Config.InsecureSkipVerify setting.

**7. Technical Details (Extracted from Content):**

*   The vulnerability is in `crypto/tls/key_agreement.go` within the `generateClientKeyExchange()` function.
*   The problematic code assumes the public key is of type `*rsa.PublicKey` when a TLS\_RSA cipher suite is negotiated.
*   The fix involves adding error checking for the key type assertion before proceeding with encryption. The fix is adding a check such as `rsaKey, ok := cert.PublicKey.(*rsa.PublicKey)` and returning an error if `ok` is false.
*   Affected clients are those using TLS 1.0-1.2 ciphersuites with RSA keys for key exchange; clients that disable `TLS_RSA` cipher suites or are TLS 1.3-only are not affected.
*   The vulnerability exists in Go versions through 1.16.5.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes multiple references to different software and operating systems being affected by this CVE, highlighting the widespread nature of the vulnerability across various systems that use Go's TLS library.
*   The provided data includes links to commits and bug reports, along with remediation steps, which can help in understanding the issue better.
*   The NetApp advisory provides an excellent summarization of the vulnerability, along with affected products, workarounds, and patches and highlights that successful exploitation could lead to a DoS.
*   The Red Hat bugzilla entries confirm this vulnerability and also provide references to related tracking bugs as well as errata.
*   The Gentoo advisory confirms that `dev-lang/go` prior to `1.18.5` are affected. It also includes the information about rebuilding the @golang-rebuild set for users with Portage 3.0.9 or later.

In summary, CVE-2021-34558 is caused by an incorrect type assertion in Go's `crypto/tls` library during TLS handshakes with RSA cipher suites. This allows an attacker in a privileged network position to trigger a client-side panic by providing a crafted certificate, leading to a denial-of-service. The fixes involve input validation and correct error handling, which is available in Go releases after 1.16.5.
