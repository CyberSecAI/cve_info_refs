Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Heap buffer overflow in `SEIUnit::mvc_scalable_nesting`

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is located in the `SEIUnit::mvc_scalable_nesting` function, specifically related to memory handling when parsing SEI (Supplemental Enhancement Information) messages. The provided ASan output indicates a heap-buffer-overflow during a `memcmp` operation, suggesting that the code is reading beyond allocated memory boundaries while processing SEI data.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow. This arises due to incorrect bounds checking or insufficient memory allocation when handling SEI payloads, particularly when the last byte of the SEI payload is 0xFF. This causes a read operation to access memory outside of the allocated buffer during the `memcmp` operation.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Crash:** The provided ASan output indicates that the exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a crash of the `tsMuxeR` application due to memory corruption.
    *   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While the immediate impact is a crash, heap buffer overflows can potentially be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution if an attacker has control over the overflowed data.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malformed SEI Data:** The attack vector involves providing specially crafted input to `tsMuxeR` that contains a malformed SEI payload which causes the overflow in `SEIUnit::mvc_scalable_nesting`. Specifically, the issue occurs with a last byte equal to 0xFF, when handling payload type and payload size in a loop.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Ability to Provide Input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide input to `tsMuxeR` that contains the malicious SEI data. This could be through a crafted video file or other data stream processed by the application.

**Additional Details:**

* The provided commit diff for `nalUnits.cpp` shows a fix that involves adding checks to ensure `curBuff` is not past `nalEnd` before accessing the byte to determine `payloadType` and `payloadSize`. This shows an attempt to resolve the out-of-bounds read issue.
* The ASan output also includes the call stack showing how the vulnerability is reached, starting from `METADemuxer::detectTrackReader` and ultimately triggering the overflow in `SEIUnit::mvc_scalable_nesting`.
* The provided PoC file (`scalable_nesting_poc.zip`) and the command to run it (`./tsmuxer scalable_nesting_poc`) confirm the ability to reproduce the crash by processing a specific input.

In summary, the vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the `SEIUnit::mvc_scalable_nesting` function of `tsMuxeR`, triggered by malformed SEI data, leading to a crash. The provided information allows for the reproduction of the issue using the PoC data and addresses the root cause by fixing the out-of-bounds read in `nalUnits.cpp`.
