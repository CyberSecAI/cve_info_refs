Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Vulnerability:** CVE-2021-34675

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the insufficient access controls for PDF reports generated by the NEX-Forms WordPress plugin. The plugin stores generated PDF reports in the `/wp-content/uploads/` directory, which is a public directory accessible to anyone without authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of access control on the generated PDF report file. The plugin does not enforce any authentication or authorization checks before allowing access to the PDF report.
*   **Public Storage:** Storing the PDF report in the publicly accessible `wp-content/uploads` directory exposes it to anyone who knows the file path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An unauthenticated attacker can access the PDF reports, potentially containing sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) submitted via the forms. This data could be used for malicious purposes, such as identity theft or other fraudulent activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct File Request:** The attacker can directly access the PDF file by requesting its URL (e.g., `/wp-content/uploads/submission_report.pdf`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have any user account or be logged in to the WordPress site.
*   **Knowledge of File Path:** The attacker only needs to know or guess the path where the PDF reports are stored. The path is predictable: `/wp-content/uploads/submission_report.pdf`.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** NEX-Forms versions 7.8.7 and earlier are affected by this vulnerability.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed in version 7.8.8 of the plugin. The fix was implemented by not storing the file in a public directory and instead delivering it as a server response upon request.
*   **Specifics:** The vulnerability exists in the "Reporting" section of the plugin, which is used to generate PDF and Excel exports of form submissions.

In summary, this vulnerability is a classic case of insecure direct object reference, where the plugin fails to implement proper access control, leading to the exposure of sensitive data.
