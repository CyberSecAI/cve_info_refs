- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A crafted request with invalid offsets can cause an out-of-bounds read or write access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial-of-service or local memory overwrite.
- **Attack vectors**: Network; a crafted request is sent to the CODESYS Control runtime system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a request to the controller. The request is only processed if no level 1 online password is configured on the controller or if the attacker has previously successfully authenticated to the controller.
