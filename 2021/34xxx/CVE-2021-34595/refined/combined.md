The CODESYS Control runtime system enables embedded or PC-based devices to be a programmable
industrial controller. It provides a communication server for the communication with clients like the CODESYS
Development System. This server has the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2021-34595: CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
A crafted request with invalid offsets may cause an out-of-bounds read or write access in the affected
CODESYS products, resulting in a denial-of-service condition or local memory overwrite.

CVE-2021-34596: CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
A crafted request may cause a read access to an uninitialized pointer in the affected CODESYS products,
resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

The crafted requests are only processed on the controller, if no level 1 online password is configured on the
controller or if the attacker has previously successfully authenticated himself at the controller.

3.2  Exploitability

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

3.3  Difficulty

An attacker with low skills would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.

3.4  Existence of exploit

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

4  Available software updates

CODESYS GmbH has released the following product versions to solve the noted vulnerability issues for the
affected CODESYS products:

• CODESYS Runtime Toolkit 32 bit full version V2.4.7.56
• CODESYS PLCWinNT version V2.4.7.56. This will also be part of the CODESYS Development System setup
version V2.3.9.68.

Please visit the CODESYS update area for more information on how to obtain the software update [3].

5  Mitigation

CODESYS GmbH recommends using the available software update to fix the vulnerabilities.

In addition, the CODESYS Control V2 runtime can be protected by a PLC password. A configured PLC
password for password level 1 will prevent the attacks described above, even in the case that the software
update is not applied.

As part of a security strategy, CODESYS GmbH recommends the following general defense measures to
reduce the risk of exploits:
• Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that
they are not accessible from outside
• Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks
• Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required
• Activate and apply user management and password features
• Use encrypted communication links
• Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.
• Protect both development and control system by using up-to-date virus detecting solutions
For more information and general recommendations for protecting machines and plants, see also the
CODESYS Security Whitepaper [1].
