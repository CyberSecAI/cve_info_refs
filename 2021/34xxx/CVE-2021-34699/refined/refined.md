Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-34699:

**1. Verification:**

*   The provided documents explicitly mention CVE-2021-34699 and describe a vulnerability related to it, confirming that the content is relevant.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an "improper interaction between the web UI and the CLI parser" in Cisco IOS and IOS XE software.
*   Specifically, the vulnerability is present in the TrustSec CLI parser.
*   The underlying cause is related to how the web UI sends CLI commands for execution.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Handling:** The web UI and CLI parser do not handle CLI commands correctly. Specifically, when a CLI command is passed from the web UI to the parser, the Trustsec subsystem on the device is impacted and vulnerable to an exploit, which can cause a reload.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A successful exploit can cause an affected Cisco device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.
*   **Device Reload:** The device will become unavailable when it reloads.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
*   **Web UI:** The attack vector is the device's web UI.
*   **Authenticated:** The attacker must be authenticated to send the malformed request through the web UI.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the device's web interface.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker requires valid credentials to log into the web UI of the targeted device.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable CLI Command:** The attacker needs to send a specific CLI command, which is not described in detail in the advisory. This information is known based on the provided CSAF file of the advisory.

**7. Additional Details (from the content):**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco devices running vulnerable versions of IOS or IOS XE software, having TrustSec capabilities, and with the web UI enabled are affected.
*   **Workarounds:** Disabling the HTTP server feature may mitigate the attack, but it's not a complete fix. Use the `no ip http server` or `no ip http secure-server` commands.
*   **Unaffected Products:** IOS XR Software, Meraki products, and NX-OS Software are confirmed to be not vulnerable.
*   **Software Checker:** Cisco provides a tool called "Cisco Software Checker" to help customers identify vulnerable software releases and determine which releases are patched.
*   **Exploitation Awareness:** At the time of the advisory, Cisco PSIRT was not aware of any public announcements or malicious exploitation of the vulnerability.
*   **Discovery:** The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.

This information is more detailed than the basic CVE description, providing specifics on affected products, mitigations, and the underlying cause of the vulnerability.
