Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-34986:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) issue in the Parallels Service. This means there is a race condition where a check is performed on a file, but then the file is used at a later time and can be modified in between.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **TOCTOU vulnerability:** The service doesn't handle file operations atomically, allowing for modifications after a check but before use. This allows a symbolic link to be created pointing to a malicious file after checks.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  By abusing the service and its improper handling of file access via symbolic links, a low privilege user can gain root privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege escalation:** Successful exploitation leads to the attacker gaining root privileges on the system.
- **Arbitrary code execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges by having the service execute their malicious file.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker must have local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Symbolic Link Abuse:** The attacker creates a symbolic link that redirects the service to their malicious file, exploiting the TOCTOU vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- The attacker must be able to create symbolic links.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Parallels on 2021-07-09, and a fix was released. The ZDI advisory (ZDI-22-385) identifies the vulnerability as ZDI-CAN-13932.
