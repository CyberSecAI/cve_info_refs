Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-34700:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient access control to sensitive information on the affected system. The vulnerability lies within the CLI interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software, where access to sensitive information is not adequately restricted.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Disclosure: The primary vulnerability is the ability to read arbitrary files on the underlying file system due to inadequate access controls on sensitive information. This could lead to exposure of sensitive configuration files, credentials, and other confidential data.
- CWE-522: This vulnerability is classified as CWE-522, which refers to "Insufficiently Protected Credentials". This indicates a problem with how the system manages or restricts access to sensitive credentials or other authentication information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The most direct impact is information disclosure, where an attacker can read any file on the system, including sensitive files.
- This information disclosure can be further leveraged: The attacker could use the stolen sensitive information to create forged authentication requests which would grant unauthorized access to the web UI of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker needs to have local access to the affected system. Specifically, access to the CLI interface.
- Authenticated attacker: The attacker must be authenticated to be able to use the vulnerable CLI interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated, local user on the system.
- The attacker must have access to the CLI interface of the Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software releases earlier than 20.4.2
- Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software releases earlier than 20.5.1

**Fixed Software:**
- Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software release 20.4.2 and later
- Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software release 20.5.1 and later
