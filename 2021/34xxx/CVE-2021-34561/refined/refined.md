  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application relies on reverse DNS resolution for security-critical actions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reliance on Reverse DNS Resolution for a Security-Critical Action (CWE-350)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can bypass IP or firewall-based access restrictions by using DNS Rebinding through their target's browser. This can lead to remote code execution and/or information disclosure.",
  "Attack vectors": "DNS Rebinding attacks using a malicious website loaded in the user's browser. The attacker needs to trick a user to visit a malicious web page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to serve a malicious webpage to the user and the user must visit the page using a browser that can reach the targeted Pepperl+Fuchs WirelessHART-Gateway."
