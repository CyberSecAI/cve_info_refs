Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-34765:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) filters applied to file download actions in the web UI of Cisco Nexus Insights.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing RBAC:** The core weakness is the failure to enforce RBAC when handling file downloads. This allows authenticated users, regardless of their specific roles, to access files they should not have access to.
*  **Information Disclosure:** Due to the missing RBAC filters, an authenticated user can potentially download sensitive files related to the web application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely through the web UI.
*   **Authenticated Access Required:** The attacker needs valid device credentials to log in to the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must possess valid login credentials for the Cisco Nexus Insights application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable web UI.
