Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-34883:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing J2K files. This leads to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the parsing of J2K files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can leverage this vulnerability, potentially in conjunction with other vulnerabilities, to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. This could lead to sensitive information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves opening a maliciously crafted J2K file with an affected version of Bentley View or MicroStation-based application.
- User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability in that the target must open a malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious J2K file.
- The attacker requires the victim to open the crafted J2K file using the vulnerable software.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
- Bentley has released updates to correct the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is related to several other vulnerabilities identified in the parsing of J2K files.
- The CVSS score is 3.3, with a vector of AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N, indicating a low severity. This is lower than the 7.8 severity score listed in the Bentley advisory, but the 7.8 score represents the combined impact of multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-34883.
