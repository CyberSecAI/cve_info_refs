- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the internal microcontroller of NVIDIA GPUs and Tegra hardware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The microcontroller allows access to unscrubbed registers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with elevated privileges can gain access to information from these unscrubbed registers, leading to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is local, requiring the attacker to have OS administrative/kernel rights.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs OS administrative or kernel level privileges to exploit the vulnerability. The complexity of the attack is rated as High.
