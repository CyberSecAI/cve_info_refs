Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-34298:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `BMP_Loader.dll` library lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing BMP files. Specifically, the issue arises from the lack of validation of the existence of an object before performing further free operations on it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free (CWE-416):** The vulnerability is a use-after-free, occurring when a program attempts to access memory that has already been freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This can lead to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Parsing:** The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a maliciously crafted BMP file.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, specifically the user must open a malicious BMP file within the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** Although the advisory states "remote attackers" can execute arbitrary code, the CVSS vector `AV:L` shows the attack vector is local.
- **User Interaction:** An attacker needs to trick the user into opening a malicious BMP file with the vulnerable application.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Siemens JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization, specifically in versions prior to V13.2.
- This specific vulnerability was assigned ZDI-CAN-13060 by the Zero Day Initiative.
