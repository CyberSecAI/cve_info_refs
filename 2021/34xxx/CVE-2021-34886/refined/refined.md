Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-34886

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is caused by a lack of validation of the existence of an object before performing operations on it during the parsing of FBX files. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read or use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The software attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer.
*   **Use-after-free:** The software attempts to access memory that has already been freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially disclose sensitive information by triggering the vulnerability.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By combining this vulnerability with other vulnerabilities, an attacker may achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through a specially crafted FBX file.
*   The user must open a malicious FBX file using the affected software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious FBX file.
*   The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious file with the vulnerable application.

**Affected Software:**
*   MicroStation versions prior to 10.16.02.*
*   Bentley View versions prior to 10.16.02.*

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade to MicroStation and Bentley View version 10.16.02.* or later.
*   Only open FBX files from trusted sources.

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerability was discovered by Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
