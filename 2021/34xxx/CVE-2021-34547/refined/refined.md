- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application lacks CSRF protection mechanisms, such as anti-CSRF tokens, for critical actions like user creation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user without their consent. This specific exploit demonstrates the creation of a new user account with attacker-controlled credentials. Other actions can also be performed if the attacker crafts the correct parameters for those actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that sends a POST request to the vulnerable application. This page is then distributed to a user of the application, typically an administrator. When the victim opens the page, the included form automatically submits the request in the background via a script within the page, leveraging their already authenticated session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to entice a logged-in user (victim) to open a malicious webpage. No direct access to the application is needed by the attacker.
