        "index": "1",
        "content": "The Bluetooth Classic implementation on several chipsets does not properly handle the reception of continuous unsolicited LMP responses that trigger a heap overflow within the BT firmware. This allows attackers in radio range to trigger a denial of service (either restart or deadlock the device) by flooding a device with LMP_AU_rand packet.",

          "index": "2",
          "content": "Many major chipset vendors are affected by this attack as shown in Table 2. This attack is similar to Feature Response Flooding (Section 8.4), indicating that flooding testing with packets from certain LMP procedures may not have been well tested. This may arise because the Core Specifications only allows a limited LMP testing mode [28] that restricts the SoC to work with only a few LMP packets. This, in turn, may restrict the test flexibility for BT vendors. Specifically, vendors may have a limited capacity of tests that they can perform with their production BT firmware, such as flooding or sending out-of-order packets during normal LMP procedures.",

            "root_cause": "Limited testing flexibility due to restrictions in the Bluetooth Core Specificationâ€™s LMP test mode.",

               "Lack of robust testing of LMP procedures",
