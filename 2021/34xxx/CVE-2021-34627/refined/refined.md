Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of **CVE-2021-34627**:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2021-34627. It is listed under the "WP Upload Restriction <= 2.2.3 â€“ Missing Access Control in getSelectedMimeTypesByRole function" section.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control in the `getSelectedMimeTypesByRole` function within the "WP Upload Restriction" plugin.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Insufficient access control in the `getSelectedMimeTypesByRole` function, which allows unauthenticated users to retrieve approved mime types for any given role. This bypasses intended restrictions and may expose sensitive configuration details.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  An attacker can retrieve approved mime types for any given user role by exploiting this vulnerability. This information could be useful to craft more specific attacks, but the primary impact is sensitive information disclosure rather than direct system compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Attackers can exploit this by sending crafted requests to the vulnerable plugin's endpoint, leveraging the missing access control in the specified function
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, like a subscriber.
    *   No special privileges or elevated access is needed

**3. Additional Notes:**

*   The content highlights the "Missing Access Control" issues in the context of the `getSelectedMimeTypesByRole` function. It also references CVE-2021-34625 and CVE-2021-34626 for similar issues in the same plugin (stored XSS and arbitrary deletion, respectively).
*   The "Recommended Remediation" is to uninstall the plugin, as no patch seems to be available.

In summary, the vulnerability in CVE-2021-34627 arises from an improperly protected function in the WP Upload Restriction plugin, which exposes the permitted MIME types for different user roles to any authenticated user, potentially assisting in further attacks.
