**CVE-2021-34145 Analysis**

*   **Vulnerability:** LMP Invalid Max Slot Type
*   **Root Cause:** The Bluetooth Classic implementation in the Cypress WICED BT stack 2.9.0 and earlier for CYW20735B1 devices does not properly handle the reception of an `LMP_max_slot` packet with an invalid Baseband packet type and LT_ADDRESS after the completion of the LMP setup procedure.
*   **Weakness:** Improper input validation of the `LMP_max_slot` packet, specifically concerning the Baseband packet type and LT_ADDRESS fields.
*   **Impact:** A denial-of-service (DoS) condition where the target device crashes.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted `LMP_max_slot` packet with invalid Baseband packet type and LT_ADDRESS values.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be within radio range of the target device and be able to send malformed Bluetooth packets. No prior pairing or authentication is required.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered after the LMP setup procedure is complete.
*   The crafted `LMP_max_slot` packet contains invalid data in the "Type" and "LT_ADDR" fields, which leads to a crash.

**Affected Devices:**

*   Cypress CYW20735B1 devices using WICED BT stack 2.9.0 and earlier.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is part of a larger set of Bluetooth vulnerabilities collectively called "BrakTooth".
*   The provided document highlights that vendors may lack tools or flexibility for comprehensive testing of Bluetooth link manager implementations under unexpected packet exchanges.
