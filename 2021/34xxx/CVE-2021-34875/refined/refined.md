Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-34875

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability lies in the parsing of 3DS files within Bentley View and MicroStation.
* Specifically, crafted data within a 3DS file can trigger a write operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
* This out-of-bounds write is caused by a flaw in how the software handles the 3DS file format.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process (i.e., the application that opens the malicious 3DS file).
* This could lead to full system compromise, depending on the application's privileges and the attacker's chosen payload.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The primary attack vector is through opening a maliciously crafted 3DS file. This could be achieved in different ways:
    * A user could be tricked into opening a malicious 3DS file received via email or downloaded from the web.
    * A malicious web page could trigger the vulnerable parsing process through a specially crafted 3DS file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted 3DS file containing malicious data to trigger the out-of-bounds write.
* The attacker requires user interaction, meaning the victim must open the malicious file with a vulnerable application or visit a malicious webpage that forces the application to handle the file.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
*   Bentley released updated versions of MicroStation and Bentley View to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is also tracked under ZDI-CAN-14827.
*   Multiple other CVEs are related to similar vulnerabilities affecting MicroStation and MicroStation-based applications in the parsing of 3DS files. This advisory is grouped under BE-2021-0004, which covers a range of related vulnerabilities.
*   The CVSS v3.1 score for this vulnerability is 7.8.
*  The severity of the vulnerability is considered high (C:H/I:H/A:H).
* The affected versions are MicroStation and Bentley View versions prior to 10.16.02. The mitigated versions are 10.16.02 and later.
