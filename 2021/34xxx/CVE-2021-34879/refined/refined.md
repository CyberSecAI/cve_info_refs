Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-34879:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of object existence before operations are performed on the object within the parsing of J2K files. Specifically, the software fails to check if an object exists before attempting to use it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Use-after-free vulnerability in the parsing of J2K files. The software does not validate if an object exists before it attempts to operate on it, which can lead to the use of a freed memory location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. This can lead to complete system compromise and full control of the target machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves opening a maliciously crafted J2K file using the vulnerable software, either by visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file. The attacker needs to craft a malicious J2K file that triggers the use-after-free condition when parsed by the vulnerable software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to deliver or lure the user into opening a malicious J2K file. No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability once a user opens the malicious file. User interaction is required for the exploit to be successful.
