{
  "CVE-2021-34433": {
    "root_cause": "The DTLS client in Eclipse Californium does not properly verify the server certificate when the ServerKeyExchange message does not contain a signature. According to RFC5246, the ServerKeyExchange may have no signed_params for anonymous key exchanges. However, the signed_params may be omitted by an attacker in non-anonymous key exchanges to bypass signature verification, which is not checked by Californium.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-322: Key Exchange without Entity Authentication"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass server authentication and potentially establish a connection with a malicious server.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious server can send a certificate and no signature in the ServerKeyExchange message to a vulnerable client, bypassing signature verification.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be in a position to act as a server during a DTLS handshake and send malicious ServerKeyExchange messages."
