{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `successURL` parameter of the `/ssoAdapter/logoutAction.do` endpoint.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Open Redirect"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities. The open redirect allows for phishing attacks by redirecting users to malicious sites.",
    "attack_vector": "The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `successURL` parameter.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking a malicious URL. This could be achieved through social engineering or by embedding the link on a third-party website."
