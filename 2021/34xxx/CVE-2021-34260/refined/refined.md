The provided content relates to CVE-2021-34260.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a missing check on the validity of the `if_descriptor->bLength` variable within the `USBH_ParseInterfaceDesc()` function. This function parses interface descriptors from a USB device.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists because the code does not validate the `if_descriptor->bLength` against the total length of the input buffer. This could lead to an out-of-bounds read when `USBH_GetNextDesc()` is called.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to incorrect system configuration with wrong parameters, potentially causing unexpected behavior, system instability, or a crash.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves sending a malformed USB device packet with an invalid `if_descriptor->bLength` value. This value is read directly from the USB data stream.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to control the USB device packet sent to the target device, specifically the interface descriptor. They need to craft a USB packet with a `if_descriptor->bLength` that causes an out of bounds read in the subsequent `USBH_GetNextDesc()` call.
