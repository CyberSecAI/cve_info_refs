- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to an insecurely implemented REST-API endpoint in the SEOPress plugin. The `permission_callback` only checks for a valid REST-API nonce, which can be generated by any authenticated user, regardless of their role. Additionally, the SEO title and description parameters were not sanitized or escaped, leading to Stored XSS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Insecure REST API endpoint permission checks, allowing any authenticated user to access the endpoint.
    - Lack of sanitization/escaping on the SEO title and description parameters, leading to Stored XSS
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers could inject arbitrary web scripts that would execute anytime a user accessed the “All Posts” page. This could lead to malicious actions like administrative account creation, webshell injection, arbitrary redirects, and complete site takeover.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a PUT request to the vulnerable REST-API endpoint with a valid nonce and malicious web scripts in the title and description fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site to generate a valid REST-API nonce. They also need to know the REST-API endpoint.
