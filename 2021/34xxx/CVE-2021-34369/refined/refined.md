Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly validate and authorize access to user data based on the `contactSeqNumber` parameter. It uses Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) to retrieve data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application uses the `contactSeqNumber` parameter directly in the request to retrieve user details. This allows an attacker to manipulate the value of `contactSeqNumber` and access data belonging to other users.
*   **Lack of Authorization:** The application does not perform sufficient checks to ensure that the user making the request is authorized to view the data associated with the given `contactSeqNumber`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** An attacker can view other user's data including personal information, by manipulating the `contactSeqNumber` parameter.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted GET request to `/portlets/contact/ref/refContactDetail.do` with a modified `contactSeqNumber` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be a valid authenticated user of the Accela Civic Platform to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of the Application Structure:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable URL and the parameter `contactSeqNumber`.

**Technical Details:**

The provided text shows a sample HTTP GET request demonstrating the vulnerability. By modifying the `contactSeqNumber` the attacker can retrieve the information for a different contact. The request header includes:
```
GET /portlets/contact/ref/refContactDetail.do?mode=view&lookup=false&contactSeqNumber=848693&module=Licenses HTTP/1.1
```

The attacker can change the value of `contactSeqNumber` (e.g., 848693) to other values to access other users' data.
