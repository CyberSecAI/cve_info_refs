Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the parsing of JT files within Bentley View. Specifically, it's caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The lack of proper validation when parsing JT files can result in a read operation past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information by reading data beyond the intended boundaries.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** The advisory notes that this vulnerability, when combined with other vulnerabilities, could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious JT Files:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious JT file with specific data that triggers the out-of-bounds read when parsed by vulnerable software.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploiting this vulnerability requires user interaction. Specifically, the target user must open a malicious JT file or visit a malicious page that triggers the parsing of a malicious JT file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious JT file.
*   The attacker must be able to deliver this file to a user of Bentley View and induce them to open it.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Bentley View versions prior to 10.16.02.\*.
*   Bentley has released an update to address this issue.
*   The advisory is linked to ZDI-21-1531 / ZDI-CAN-15051.
*   This vulnerability is also listed under the broader advisory BE-2021-0005 which encompasses multiple CVEs related to out-of-bounds and use-after-free vulnerabilities in Bentley products.
