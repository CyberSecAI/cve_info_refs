- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `Gif_loader.dll` library lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing GIF files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write. Specifically, a write past the end of an allocated structure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a malicious GIF file via Siemens JT2Go or Teamcenter Visualization. User interaction is required, where the target must open a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted GIF file.
