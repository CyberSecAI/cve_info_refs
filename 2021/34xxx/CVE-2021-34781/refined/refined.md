    "summary": "A vulnerability in the processing of SSH connections for multi-instance deployments of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "This vulnerability is due to a lack of proper error handling when an SSH session fails to be established.",
