Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-34586:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a NULL pointer dereference in the CODESYS V2 web server when processing specific crafted web server requests. The server does not validate pointers before dereferencing them, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference. The web server does not properly check if a pointer is valid before attempting to access the memory it points to. This can be triggered by specific malformed requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial-of-Service (DoS): Exploitation of this vulnerability can cause the CODESYS web server to crash, leading to a denial of service condition. This can impact the availability of the web-based visualization interface provided by CODESYS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks using crafted web server requests

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated, requiring only the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. However, post V1.1.9.20, if the CODESYS V2.3 WebVisu user management is activated, the attacker needs to be authenticated.
- No special skills are required as the exploit is considered to have low difficulty.

**Detailed Explanation:**
The CODESYS V2 web server is vulnerable to multiple issues, including NULL pointer dereferences, one of which is related to CVE-2021-34586. The vulnerability occurs when handling specific malformed messages starting with `|9`, `|10`, `|b` or `|e`.
- When processing these message types, the server uses `strchr` to find a specific delimiter `|` within the provided data. If the delimiter is not present, `strchr` returns `NULL`. The server then attempts to dereference this `NULL` pointer without proper validation, which results in a crash.
- Another NULL pointer dereference occurs when the server is in a specific parsing state (state 4) and a specific character is not in the input, leading to a NULL pointer being used.
- The server uses the value of a pointer returned by `strchr` without validating if that pointer is valid.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- A proof of concept (POC) exploit is publicly available.
- The vulnerability is considered critical, with a CVSS v3.0 base score of 9.1. (7.5 according to the Tenable content)
