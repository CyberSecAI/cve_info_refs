- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect message stream deserialization within the NVIDIA OTE protocol.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  A buffer overflow due to improper deserialization of message streams.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure and data modification.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious client application (CA) run by a user can trigger the vulnerability in the TrustZone via an incorrect message deserialization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access with user privileges and the ability to run a malicious client application.
