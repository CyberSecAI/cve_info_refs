    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-34776",
    "affected_products": "Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches",
    "vulnerability_details": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause LLDP memory corruption on an affected device.\n\nThese vulnerabilities are due to missing length validation checks when processing LLDP messages. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious LLDP packet to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an out-of-bounds read of the valid LLDP packet data, which could allow the attacker to cause corruption in the internal LLDP database of the affected device.",
    "root_cause": "Missing length validation checks when processing LLDP messages.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
        "LLDP database corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could cause an out-of-bounds read of valid LLDP packet data, leading to corruption in the internal LLDP database of the affected device.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker sends a malicious LLDP packet to the targeted device.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be adjacent (Layer 2) to the affected device, in the same broadcast domain. No authentication required.",
    "workarounds": "There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities. However, administrators may disable the affected feature. To disable LLDP on the LAN interface of a device, do the following:\nOpen the web-based management interface and choose Administration > Discovery LLDP > Properties. Uncheck the LLDP Status check box.",
