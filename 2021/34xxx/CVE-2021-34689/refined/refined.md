Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-34689:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is insufficient protection of sensitive information. The system's Personal Key is written to world-readable log files without proper protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information disclosure: The system's Personal Key is exposed in world-readable log files.
- Inadequate access control: Log files containing the sensitive key are accessible to any local user on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A locally authenticated attacker can gain access to the system's Personal Key. This key can be used to establish unauthorized remote access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker needs to have local access to the system where RemotePC is installed.
- File system access: The attacker must be able to read the log files in the `%PROGRAMDATA%` directory, which are world-readable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a valid account on the local system.
- The attacker must be able to navigate the file system and access the `%PROGRAMDATA%` directory.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability only affects RemotePC for Windows before version 7.6.48.
- The key is stored in plaintext, making it easily accessible after the logs are obtained.
