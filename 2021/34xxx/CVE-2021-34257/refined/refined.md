Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The WPanel4 CMS has multiple file upload functionalities that lack proper file type restrictions. This allows an authenticated user to upload and execute arbitrary files, including PHP scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The CMS doesn't validate file types during upload. This allows users to upload executable files like PHP scripts disguised as images or other allowed file types.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The system does not sanitize or validate uploaded files, allowing for the execution of malicious code.
*   **Multiple Vulnerable Endpoints:** The vulnerability is present in various upload locations throughout the CMS, including profile avatar, post folder images, page folder images, and gallery folders, increasing the attack surface.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary PHP code, achieving complete control over the server.
*   **Server Compromise:** With RCE, the attacker can perform various malicious actions, such as data theft, malware installation, or server takeover.
*   **Potential privilege escalation** In the provided example, the attacker was able to gain access as the root user

**Attack vectors:**

*   **File Upload Functionality:** Attackers exploit file upload prompts in the CMS (e.g., avatar image, folder image, gallery folder).
*   **Malicious File Upload:** Attackers upload PHP reverse shells disguised as legitimate image files.
*   **HTTP Request:** After uploading the file, the attacker can trigger the execution of the shell by visiting the location of the uploaded file in a web browser, initiating a reverse shell connection back to their system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid user credentials for the WPanel4 CMS. This vulnerability is not exploitable without authentication.
*   **Access to Upload Functionality:** The attacker needs access to the CMS sections that contain file upload prompts (Dashboard, Posts, Pages, Gallery).
