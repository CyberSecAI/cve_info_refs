Hi all,

Today, we released some updates for TeamViewer 15 for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

We implemented the following fixes:

* CVE-2021-34858: Installations with existing TV recording files (TVS) were vulnerable to a problem in file parsing that could have allowed someone to execute arbitrary code and could have caused the binary to crash. User interaction as well as a third-party vulnerability would have been required for remote exploitation.Â **We donâ€™t have any indication of exploitation in the wild**. Our thanks go to Kdot and the Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative for the responsible disclosure.
* CVE-2021-34859: In some circumstances, a problem in shared memory management could have caused the TeamViewer service to perform an out-of-bounds read. Access to the machine would have been required for exploitation.Â **We donâ€™t have any indication of exploitation in the wild**. Our thanks go to Mat Powell and the Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative for the responsible disclosure.
* [Windows only]: TeamViewer is installed by default in the protected Program Files directory. If a user intentionally had chosen to install it in a different location, someone would have been able to leverage a privilege escalation problem. Access to the machine would have been required for exploitation.Â **We donâ€™t have any indication of exploitation in the wild**. Our thanks go to Maciej Miszczyk for the responsible disclosure.

Please see ourÂ [Change Logs](https://community.teamviewer.com/English/categories/change-logs-en)Â and you will find the new version ready for download on our homepage:

***Edit****: this vulnerability has already been patched on August 24th, 2021, with v15.21.2Â but due to misunderstanding, did not make it to the initial release notes.*

*From a low-privileged user it is possible to modify shared memory and cause the TeamViewer service to perform an out-of-bounds read. The service then writes the data to the TeamViewer log file, where it can be read by the attacker.*

*In this way, an attacker can disclose memory from the service process. This may be useful to an attacker as part of a larger exploit, perhaps ultimately resulting in execution of arbitrary code within the TeamViewer service running as SYSTEM.*

***We donâ€™t have any indication of exploitation in the wild****. Our thanks go to Kharosx0 and the Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative for the responsible disclosure.*Â This was tracked under CVE-2021-35005. *This vulnerability has been patched with v15.21.2 on august 24th 2021.*

All the best,

Esther
