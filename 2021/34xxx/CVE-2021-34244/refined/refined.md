- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ICE Hrm application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The application does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious HTML page that can be used to change a user's password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability exists in the application's password change functionality. Lack of CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can perform account takeover by changing the user's password or creating new admin accounts.
- **Attack vectors:**  An attacker can craft a malicious HTML page containing a form that makes a request to the vulnerable application. This malicious page is then delivered to a victim user. Once the user opens the page, the browser automatically sends the request to the vulnerable application, which changes the user's password. The malicious HTML can be hosted on any server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to host a malicious HTML file and trick the victim into opening the page while logged in to the vulnerable application.
