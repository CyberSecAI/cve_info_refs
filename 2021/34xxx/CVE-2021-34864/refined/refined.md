- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper access control within the WinAppHelper component of Parallels Desktop.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the target guest system is required to execute low-privileged code, which can then leverage the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system.
