Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-34929:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of JT files within Bentley View. Specifically, crafted data within a JT file can trigger a write past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The software attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer. This memory corruption can be exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Bentley View.
- Successful exploitation leads to code execution within the context of the current process. This means the attacker gains the same level of access as the user running the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious JT files are the attack vector.
- The target must open a malicious JT file or visit a malicious page that triggers the parsing of a malicious JT file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious JT file.
- The attacker must trick the user into opening the malicious JT file using a vulnerable version of Bentley View, or visit a malicious page that triggers the parsing of a malicious JT file.
- No special privileges are needed on the target machine.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is also present in MicroStation and MicroStation-based applications when opening maliciously crafted JT files.
- Bentley has released updates to address the vulnerability.
- This vulnerability is associated with ZDI-CAN-14907.

**CVSS Score:** 7.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) which indicates a high severity.
