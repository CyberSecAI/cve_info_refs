Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-34868

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the Toolgate component of Parallels Desktop. This missing validation leads to an uncontrolled memory allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Uncontrolled memory allocation due to insufficient input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to escalate their privileges.
- Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the hypervisor's context, gaining control over the virtualized environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have initial access to the guest system and be able to execute low-privileged code. This suggests a scenario where the attacker has already compromised the guest OS but is looking for a path to elevate their privileges to the hypervisor level.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the Toolgate component of Parallels Desktop.
- Parallels released an update to fix the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2021-04-22 and publicly disclosed on 2021-09-08.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Reno Robert of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
- The ZDI tracking ID for this vulnerability is ZDI-21-1056 or ZDI-CAN-13712

**CVSS Score:** 7.8 (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) indicating High severity.
