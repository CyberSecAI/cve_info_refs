Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of JP2 files in Bentley View. This insufficient validation leads to a read operation that goes beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, where the software attempts to access memory outside the boundaries of the allocated buffer. This happens due to the lack of validation of the size of the data read from the JP2 file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The out-of-bounds read can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information stored in memory adjacent to the buffer.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The advisory from ZDI mentions that this vulnerability, in conjunction with other vulnerabilities, can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious JP2 Files:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious JP2 files that, when opened, trigger the out-of-bounds read.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploiting this vulnerability requires user interaction. The user must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious JP2 file using the vulnerable software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious JP2 file.
*   The attacker needs to entice the victim to open the crafted JP2 file using the vulnerable Bentley View application.

**Additional Notes**
*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerability is also present in MicroStation and MicroStation-based applications.
*   Bentley has released updates to correct this vulnerability. The advisory recommends updating to version 10.16.02 or later.
*   The advisory also mentions other CVEs related to out-of-bounds and use-after-free vulnerabilities in MicroStation and MicroStation-based applications (CVE-2021-34884, CVE-2021-34918, CVE-2021-34919, CVE-2021-46582, CVE-2021-46611, CVE-2021-46632) when opening malicious JP2 files.
