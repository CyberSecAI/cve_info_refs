Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-34887:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PDF files within Bentley View. This improper validation leads to a read past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the software attempts to access memory outside the boundaries of an allocated buffer. This can lead to information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure:** The vulnerability can allow an attacker to read sensitive information from the memory space of the affected application.
- **Arbitrary code execution (potential):** While the immediate impact is information disclosure, the advisory notes that this vulnerability can be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PDF file:** The primary attack vector involves opening a maliciously crafted PDF file with an affected version of Bentley View.
- **User Interaction:** The target user must open the malicious PDF file to trigger the vulnerability, requiring user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious PDF file with specific crafted data.
- The attacker must convince a user to open the crafted PDF file using a vulnerable version of Bentley View. The attacker does not need privileged access to the system to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Bentley on 2021-08-11 and publicly disclosed on 2021-12-08.
- Bentley has released updates to address this vulnerability.
