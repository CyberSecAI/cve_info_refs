      "content": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Microsoft SharePoint. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of CAB files. When handling filenames specified within a CAB file, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the service account.",
