- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation when loading a project file. Specifically, a "zip slip" style vulnerability where a manipulated project file can cause files to be unpacked outside of the intended project directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation (CWE-20), leading to a zip slip vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can compromise the availability, integrity, or confidentiality of the application programming workstation by unpacking arbitrary files outside of the selected project directory.
- **Attack vectors**: A manipulated project file crafted by the attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a manipulated project file to the user who opens the file using PC Worx or PC Worx Express. User interaction is required.
