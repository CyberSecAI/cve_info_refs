Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-34563:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The HttpOnly attribute is not set on a cookie used by the PEPPERL+FUCHS WirelessHART-Gateway.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Absence of the HttpOnly flag on a cookie. This allows client-side JavaScript to access the cookie's value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially read or set the cookie's value using malicious JavaScript code. This can lead to session hijacking or other attacks that rely on manipulating the cookie.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is client-side JavaScript, which could be injected through XSS or other vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript in the context of the user's browser who is interacting with the WirelessHART-Gateway. This could involve exploiting a separate XSS vulnerability or tricking the user into running malicious code.
- The attacker also needs knowledge of what cookie to target, which is a sensitive one in this case.
