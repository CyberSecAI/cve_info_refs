Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-34726:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation on certain CLI commands within Cisco SD-WAN Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** The core issue is the ability to inject arbitrary commands via the CLI due to the lack of proper input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Root-Level Privilege Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute commands with *root*-level privileges on the underlying operating system of the affected device. This can lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the device's CLI.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must be authenticated as an administrative user on the affected device to execute the vulnerable commands.
*   **Crafted Input:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by submitting crafted input to the CLI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Privileges:** The attacker requires administrative user credentials.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the device's CLI interface.
