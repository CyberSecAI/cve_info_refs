- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper initialization of a buffer in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) message parser of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    -  The vulnerability lies in the LLDP message parser, specifically with how it handles buffer initialization. This allows for the corruption of the LLDP neighbor table.
    -  The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker corrupts the LLDP neighbor table and then someone tries to retrieve this corrupted table.

- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit results in the affected device crashing and reloading, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

- **Attack vectors**:
    1.  **Authenticated, remote attack**: An authenticated attacker can access the LLDP neighbor table via the CLI or SNMP when the device is in a specific state.
    2.  **Unauthenticated, adjacent attack**: An unauthenticated attacker can inject specific LLDP frames to corrupt the LLDP neighbor table. When a device administrator or network management system (NMS) retrieves the corrupted table, the vulnerability triggers.
    3. **Authenticated, adjacent attack:** An authenticated attacker with SNMP read-only credentials or low privileges on the device CLI can inject specific LLDP frames to corrupt the LLDP neighbor table, and then access this table through CLI or SNMP.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    -  For remote attacks, the attacker needs valid credentials to access the device via CLI or SNMP.
    -  For adjacent attacks, the attacker needs to be able to inject LLDP frames into the network (i.e., be on the same network segment or VLAN) and they need to be adjacent to the targeted device. Low privileged access is required for certain attacks.

- **Additional details**: The LLDP feature is disabled by default in Cisco IOS and IOS XE software. The vulnerability can be triggered by using the command `show lldp`, therefore the advisory advises against using the command to verify configuration.
