1 Introduction

Bluetooth Classic (BT) protocol is a widely used wireless
protocol in laptops, handheld devices, and audio devices. BT
main procedures are shown in Figure 1 for reference. In the
past few years, Bluetooth has come under scrutiny due to
the discovery of several critical vulnerabilities. In this report,
we disclose BRAKTOOTH, a family of new security vulner-
abilities in commercial BT stacks that range from denial of
service (DoS) via ﬁrmware crashes and deadlocks in com-
modity hardware to arbitrary code execution (ACE) in cer-
tain IoTs. As of today, we have evaluated 13 BT devices from
11 vendors. We have discovered a total of 16 new security vul-
nerabilities, with 20 common vulnerability exposures (CVEs)
already assigned and four (4) vulnerabilities are pending
CVE assignment from Intel and Qualcomm.

All the vulnerabilities are already reported to the respective
vendors, with several vulnerabilities already patched and the
rest being in the process of replication and patching. More-
over, four of the BRAKTOOTH vulnerabilities have received
bug bounty from Espressif System and Xiaomi. An explo-
ration on Bluetooth listing [29] reveals that BRAKTOOTH
affects over 1400 product listings. BRAKTOOTH exposes fun-
damental attack vectors in the closed BT stack.

As the BT stack is often shared across many products,
it is highly probable that many other products (beyond the
≈1400 entries observed in Bluetooth listing) are affected by
BRAKTOOTH. Therefore, we suggest vendors producing BT
system-on-chips (SoCs), BT modules or BT end products to
use the BRAKTOOTH proof-of-concept (PoC) code to vali-
date their BT stack implementation. The availability of the
BRAKTOOTH PoC is discussed at the end of this report.

Why BrakTooth

The code name BrakTooth is the combination of two words:
1) Brak and 2) Tooth. While the word Tooth is clearly point-
ing towards Bluetooth targets, the word Brak is Norwegian
and translates to crash in English. The BrakTooth family of

FHS stands for Frequency Hopping Synchronization, ID
stands for Identity, LMP stands for Link Manager Protocol
and ACL stands for Asynchronous Connection Less.

vulnerabilities affect Bluetooth enabled devices by contin-
uously crashing or deadlocking them, while some result in
more serious consequences such as arbitrary code execution.

2 Attack Scenario Overview

Figure 2 showcases the generic scenario in which BRAK-
TOOTH attacks are performed. The attacker only requires (1)
a cheap ESP32 development kit (ESP-WROVER-KIT [33])
with a custom (non-compliant) LMP ﬁrmware and (2) a PC
to run the PoC tool. The PoC tool communicates with the
ESP32 board via serial port (/dev/ttyUSB1) and launches the
attacks according to the speciﬁed target BDAddress (<target
bdaddr>) and exploit name parameter (<exploit_name>).

Furthermore, the PoC tool logs over-the-air (OTA) packets
and checks the health of the target by getting a paging timeout
(no response) or alternatively getting status directly from the
target via a serial port, ssh connection, etc.

Due to some vendors having a ﬁxed release schedule, we
will release the Proof of Concept (PoC) tool publicly only at

the end of October 2021. This is the time when we expect
most vendors to have released their patches. In the meantime,
any BT semiconductor or module vendor can acquire the PoC
by ﬁlling up a simple form at the BRAKTOOTH PoC website.

3 Affected BT BR/EDR chipsets

31/08/2021: As of today, vulnerabilities V6, V15 and
V16 are pending CVE trackers. These vulnerabilities af-
fect Qualcomm and Intel which are vendors that can is-
sue CVEs by themselves (CVE Numbering Authorities -
CNA). However, their default policy is to issue CVEs only
after a patch has been distributed. Therefore, Table 2
will be updated accordingly once ﬁxes for V6, V15 and
V16 are available. Regarding the availability of patches,
when our team had contacted Intel, we were informed
that their next patch is scheduled to be released by the
end of October 2021. Similarly, we are also informed by
Qualcomm that their patch for V15 will take another few
months to be propagated.

A summary of BRAKTOOTH appears in Table 2. In each
row, we use the preﬁx V to identify a security vulnerability

2

and A to indicate an anomalous behaviour (i.e., faulty target
responses) that deviates from the Core Speciﬁcations [28].
Moreover, Table 2 outlines the respective CVEs, affected
devices, protocol layers, and the violated compliance. In sum-
mary, we discovered 16 new security vulnerabilities. For all
the discovered vulnerabilities, we have followed a respon-
sible disclosure process. Speciﬁcally, we have reached out
to the affected vendors and we have provided them at least
90 days until the public disclosure of this report. In most
cases, we have also actively helped the vendors to reproduce
the reported attacks at their end. Several vendors (e.g. Cy-
press, Bluetrum, Espressif) have already produced patches
with many in the process of producing them (e.g. Qualcomm,
Intel). The status of patches is discussed in Section 5.

The impact of our discovered vulnerabilities is categorized
into (I) crashes and (II) deadlocks. Crashes generally trig-
ger a fatal assertion, segmentation faults due to a buffer or
heap overﬂow within the SoC ﬁrmware. Deadlocks, in con-
trast, lead the target device to a condition in which no further
BT communication is possible. This may happen due to the
paging scan being forcibly disabled (V16), state machine
corruption on V6 or entirely disabling BT functionality via
arbitrary code execution (ACE) on V1. Our results affect
popular BT vendors (i.e, Intel, Qualcomm, Cypress, Texas
Instruments) and relatively less known (i.e., Bluetrum, Jieli
Technology, Harman), which are still employed in many con-
sumers products such as BT speakers, keyboards, toys, etc.

V1 affects ESP32, which is used in many products ranging
from consumer electronics to industrial equipment such as
programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Hence, the impact
is signiﬁcant, as the attacker only requires knowledge of the
target BDAddress to launch the attack. Indeed, all the vul-
nerabilities V1-V16 can be triggered without any previous
pairing or authentication. Moreover, the impact of V1-V16
reaches beyond the devices listed in Table 2, since any other
BT product employing an affected SoC is also vulnerable.

Multiple Link Manager Protocol (LMP) ﬂooding attacks
(e.g., V4, V12) and V15 were detected across SoCs from
different BT vendors. Since the affected vendors are majors
in their ﬁelds (i.e., Intel & Qualcomm), it indicates that there
is a lack of ﬂexible tools for over-the-air testing even in 2021.

Besides, the Core Speciﬁcations only allows a limited "LMP

4 Impact of BRAKTOOTH

We created different concrete attacks leveraging the BRAK-
TOOTH vulnerabilities. In the following, we show three such
sample attacks that launch arbitrary code execution (ACE) or
Denial of Service (DoS) on target devices.

4.1 Arbitrary Code Execution in IoTs

The most critical vulnerability (V1 in Table 2 - 8.1) affects
ESP32 SoC [32], which is used in many Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
IoT appliances such as Industry Automation, Smart Home,
Fitness, etc. The attack is illustrated in Figure 3. A lack of
out-of-bounds check in ESP32 BT Library [10] allows the re-
ception of a mutated LMP_feature_response_ext. This results
in the injection of eight bytes of arbitrary data outside the
bounds of Extended Feature Page Table ("E. Features Table"
in Figure 3). An attacker, which knows the ﬁrmware layout
of a target device, can write a known function address (JMP
Addr.) to the offset pointed by Features Page ("Feat. Page" in
the LMP_feature_response_ext packet) ﬁeld. It turns out that
the BT Library stores some callback pointers within the out-
of-bounds Features Page offset and such a callback is even-

tually invoked during the BT connection. While exploiting
this vulnerability, we forced ESP32 into erasing its NVRAM
data (normally written during product manufacturing) by set-
ting JMP Addr. to the address of nvs_ﬂash_erase. Such erase
function is always included in ESP32 SDK [8] and there-
fore, it is present in any ESP32 ﬁrmware. Similarly, disabling
BT or BLE can be done via esp_bt_controller_disable and
Wi-Fi via disable_wiﬁ_agc. Additionally, general-purpose
input/output (GPIO) can be controlled if the attacker knows
addresses to functions controlling actuators attached to ESP32.
As expected, this has serious implications if such an attack is
applied to Bluetooth-enabled Smart Home products.

We discuss two sample DoS attacks discovered on laptops
and smartphones employing Intel AX200 SoCs [17] and Qual-
comm WCN3990 SoC [30]. Due to the number of smartphones
and laptops vulnerable to such attacks, and the common use
of BT connectivity during video conference calls and music
streaming, updating the affected devices is essential.

The ﬁrst DoS (Invalid Timing Accuracy - 8.15) is due to
a failure in the SoC to free resources upon receiving an in-
valid LMP_timing_accuracy_response from a BT slave. The
attacker can exhaust the SoC by (a) paging, (b) sending the
malformed packet, and (c) disconnecting without sending
LMP_detach. These steps are repeated with a different BT
address (i.e., BDAddress) until the SoC is exhausted from
accepting new connections. On exhaustion, the SoC fails to
recover itself and disrupts current active connections, trigger-
ing ﬁrmware crashes sporadically. This vulnerability allows
an attacker to forcibly disconnect slave BT devices currently
connected to AX200 under Windows or Linux Laptops. Simi-
larly, Android phones such as Pocophone F1 and Oppo Reno
5G [22] experience BT disruptions. For example, users con-
nected to BT Headsets experience audio to be continuously
"cut" during the attack. This also results in ﬁrmware crashes
and restart of Android BT Service. In all cases, the OS tries
to recover connectivity which can be continuously disrupted.
The second DoS (Paging Scan Disable - 8.16) affects
only devices using Intel AX200 and it is triggered when an
oversized LMP_timing_accuracy_request (>17 bytes) is sent
to AX200 slave. This temporarily corrupts AX200 ﬁrmware,
which responds incorrectly during a subsequent BT connec-
tion and eventually disables the paging scan procedure (cf.,
Figure 1). Thus, scanning AX200 works, but no connection is
established from an external BT device. Therefore, this attack
can be used to trick an user to connect to the attacker’s BT
hardware instead of the legitimate target since AX200 paging
scan is disabled. Indeed, the user needs to manually re-enable
BT to restore functionality. The attack is also used to dis-
connect certain master BT devices connected to a vulnerable
Laptop. This leads to sporadic BT ﬁrmware crashes.

4.3 Freezing Audio Products

Many vulnerabilities were discovered while testing with a BT
Speaker (Mi Portable Bluetooth Speaker - MDZ-36-DB [37]),
BT Headphone (JBL TUNE 500BT [18]) and BT Audio Mod-
ules (XY-WRBT [25] and an unbranded BT Audio Receiver).
The discovered vulnerabilities arise from failures when send-
ing oversized LMP packets (LMP Auto Rate Overﬂow -
8.5), truncated packets (Truncated LMP Accepted - 8.8),
starting procedures out-of-order (Invalid Setup Complete -
8.9) and ﬁnally by ﬂooding LMP packets (Feature Response
Flooding - 8.4).

The vulnerabilities can "freeze" Xiaomi MDZ-36-DB and

completely shut down JBL TUNE 500BT. This requires the
user to manually turn on the unresponsive devices. Since
both devices accept multiple BT connections, an attack can
be triggered while the user is playing some music. As an
exception, XY-WRBT and BT Audio Receiver accept only one
connection, which avoids an attack to be launched during an
active BT connection with the user. Nevertheless, different
products employing the same SoC may enable multiple BT
connections depending on the product requirements.

Although issues were found in SoCs targeted to Audio
products, the BT Implementation can be reused in a number
of SoCs destined to different BT products. Hence, our discov-
eries are not limited to the type of products discussed in this
section, but rather to the LMP stack implementation.

4.4 Estimating the Scope of BRAKTOOTH

In this section, we measure the potential impact of BRAK-
TOOTH vulnerabilities. To this end, we estimate the number
of product listings employing the affected BT chipsets. Each
listing may contain one or multiple (up to hundreds) products
from the same company. We get such an estimated number by
querying the Bluetooth Listings Website [29]. In particular,
we use the qualiﬁcation IDs (QIDs) of each affected SoCs to
get their corresponding products listings. The total number of
potentially affected product listings is illustrated in Table 3. In
summary, as of August 23, 2021, the total number of listings
affected is over 1400. We note that even if the number of
listings for a major vendor such as Intel seems low, its listings
have up to hundreds of product models referenced by popular
PC brands such as HP, Asustek, Dell, etc.

It is worthwhile to mention that while we can get the total
number of registered products within Bluetooth Listings web-
site for a certain chipset QID, it only reveals a lower-bound
of the exact total number of listings employing a particular
chipset. This is because product vendors may choose to cus-
tomize the design. In this case, the QID of the employed
chipset or BT stack is written to a ﬁeld called Combined
Designs. Unfortunately, the Bluetooth Listings site do not
cross-reference Combined Designs when searching for a QID,
which makes it almost impossible to get the total number of

4

products employing a particular chipset. Furthermore, prod-
ucts employing modules derived from chipsets such as ESP32,
CSR8811, etc are also not shown during the search of a chipset
QID.

In conclusion, the total number of individual product mod-
els that are potentially affected by BRAKTOOTH could be
an order of magnitude higher than the listings estimated in
Table 3.

TOOTH. The declaration ID references each product on the

From the listings shown in Table 3, we capture some in-
teresting products employing the vulnerable chipsets and list
them in Table 4. The observed types of products range from
audio appliances (BT Speakers, headsets, ambience, etc) to
personal PC/laptop computers, smartphones, and surprisingly
even automotive multimedia electronic control units (PMP3),
automotive infotainment systems (Volvo FH) and in-ﬂight
audio systems such as AMU6500. Notably Volvo FH and
AMU6500 are employing Qualcomm CSR8811/510 and Sil-
abs WT32i chipsets, respectively. As discussed in Section 5,
the Qualcomm CSR8811/510 is unlikely to receive a patch
(affected by V6) and we are not able to receive a response
from Silicon Labs regarding their status of the investigation
on Silabs WT32i (affected by V5).

4.5 Product Design Considerations

It is important to clarify that any product employing a vul-
nerable Bluetooth chipset, is not necessarily insecure (nev-
ertheless, affected due to BT connectivity being impaired).
The overall security of an end-product, which has an inter-
nal chipset with ﬁrmware ﬂaws, depends on how much the
product relies on such a vulnerable chipset for its main func-
tionality.

Figure 4 showcases common BT product design strategies

and their dependency on the BT chipset or stack.
1. In the Isolated Design, products may have their main pro-
cessor application (Product SW) communicating with a stan-
dalone BT chipset via a simplistic interface (e.g., serial AT

5

Figure 4: Examples of Bluetooth Product Design

commands, SPI/I2C transfers, etc). Such products may not
need targeted handling of vulnerabilities in the BT stack and
therefore are less impacted by a vulnerable BT chipset. This
means that BT vulnerabilities are not likely to affect the Prod-
uct SW or at least, the design allows to fully isolate attacks
coming from a vulnerable chipset. WT32i is an example of
such a BT Standalone chipset.

2. In between, a Mixed Design, which shares the BT stack
between the main processor and the BT controller, are some-
what susceptible to attacks on the speciﬁc part of the BT stack.
Since BRAKTOOTH affects the BT Baseband or LMP imple-
mentation, the host stack is not affected directly. However,
since both the BT Controller Stack and the BT Host Stack are
continuously communicating depending on what happens in-
side the BT Controller, issues on the Product SW could arise
if the HCI interface hangs. HCI interface may also misbe-
have in terms of whether the BT Controller provides expected
responses or not. Therefore, it is up to the product software
designer to investigate and handle all potential issues that can
arise in the BT host stack. In general, this involves signiﬁcant
expertise and cannot be easily derived. The Mixed Design
choice was unfortunately observed to affect products that rely
on MSP432 as the main processor and Texas Instruments
CC2564C as the BT controller when we had tested a sam-
ple code from TI’s BT stack (CC2564CMSP432BTBLESW1
(v4.2.1.1) + Service pack v1.4). In this context, attack V5 (8.5)
causes a temporary hang on MSP432, which could cause an
impact on the underlying product. In contrast, operating sys-
tems in smartphones and laptops have a mature mechanism to
handle BT controller hardware errors originated from attacks
in the BT controller. See Section 4.2 where we illustrate the
impact of BRAKTOOTH attacks on smartphones and laptops.

3. Lastly, we have the Fully Integrated Design, which is an
obvious choice for cost reduction and is widely deployed for
IoTs, speakers, headphones, and computer accessories. This
design is susceptible to BRAKTOOTH hangs, crashes, and
RCE directly on the main product functionalities. Such is due

affects ESP32 running Bluedroid BR/EDR stack.

To conclude, the assessment of a product based on its de-
pendency on the BT chipset is a fundamental approach to
understand and calculate the ﬁnal risk factors. Nevertheless,
since BRAKTOOTH affects the lower layers of several BT
implementations, at least BT connectivity is impaired regard-
less of the design choice. Therefore, this should be taken into
consideration when evaluating the product risks. Speciﬁcally,
it needs to be evaluated whether a stable BT connectivity is
always required for the assessed product to properly function.

5 BT Firmware Patches

Table 5 captures the affected vendors and the status of their
investigation. We categorize the status of the investigation in
the following forms:

• Available: The vendor has replicated the vulnerability

and a patch is available.

• Patch in progress: The vendor has successfully repli-
cated the vulnerability and a patch for the same will be
available soon.

• Investigation in progress: The vendor is currently in-
vestigating the security issue and our team is assisting
them.

• No ﬁx: The vendor has successfully replicated the issue,

but there is no plan to release a patch.

• Pending: The vendor hardly communicated with the
team and the status of their investigation is unclear at
best.

other vendors are currently at the stage of investigation or
patch development of the reported issues. We are working
with the vendors to help them reproduce the issues in their
systems such that patches are available to the public.

The vendor Texas Instruments has successfully replicated
the security issue, however, at this stage has no plan for pro-
ducing a patch. In particular, according to the Texas Instru-
ments PSIRT team, they will consider producing a patch only
if demanded by customers.

Our team approached Qualcomm to inquire whether a patch
would be available for the affected devices. We were informed
that they are working on a ﬁx for WCN3990/8 and that the
security issue reported in Qualcomm CSR8811A08 [24] has
been ﬁxed since 2011 only for ROM Versions A12 and beyond.
However, new products in 2021 are still being listed to use
CSR8811A08, which has no plan to be ﬁxed. Moreover, a
patch for the issue on CSR8510A10 [23] that causes V6 (see
Section 8.6) is not possible for CSR8510A10 due to the lack
of ROM patch space.

Zhuhai Jieli Technology conﬁrmed that a ﬁx for
AC6366C [35] would be released soon, but they did not con-
ﬁrm whether a patch would also be available to their other
audio devices AC6925C and AC6905X. Finally, we notice
for certain vendors (e.g. Harman International, Silabs), the
investigation status is unclear, as indicated by the Pending
status in Table 5.

6 Snifﬁng BT BR/EDR in less than $15

As part of our work of reverse engineering ESP32 BT stack,
we are releasing to the community a low-cost BT Classic
(BR/EDR) Active Sniffer which is available at the following
URL:

We observe that Espressif Systems, Inﬁneon (former Cy-
press) and Bluetrum have so far produced the patches. All

https://github.com/Matheus-Garbelini/esp32_bluetooth_
classic_sniffer

6

At the time of writing, this is the cheapest BR/EDR active
sniffer, we are aware of due to the low price of ESP32 boards.
ESP32-PICO-KIT can be purchased for $14.80 [21], but it is
possible to ﬁnd alternative ESP32 boards on Aliexpress for
as low as $4 [9].

Note that differently than passive sniffers, which does not
interact with the network, the ESP32 active sniffer must act
as either a BT Master or Slave device within the BT piconet.
As exempliﬁed in Figure 5, the sniffer logs BT BR/EDR
OTA protocols such as Baseband header, FHS, LMP, and
ACL packets. The sniffer cannot be used to inject packets at
the moment due to the PoC embargo. The embargo will be
lifted at the end of October 2021 and our full PoC tool will be
made available to the public for research and reproduction.

7 Reﬂection

In recent years, Bluetooth has come under scrutiny due to sev-
eral design and implementation level vulnerabilities, such
as KNOB [3], BIAS [2], SweynTooth [14], BLESA [36],
BlueMirror [6], etc. Our previous disclosure of Sweyn-
Tooth [14] vulnerabilities (2020) has clearly indicated the
lack of basic tests in Bluetooth certiﬁcation to validate the
security of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. The BRAK-
TOOTH family of vulnerabilities revisits and reasserts this
issue in the case of the older, but yet heavily used Bluetooth
classic (BR/EDR) protocol implementations. Additionally,
during the responsible disclosure period, we had the follow-
ing observations that might shed light on the future research
in Bluetooth security.

7

Replication difﬁculty: Bluetooth Core Speciﬁcations allows
a limited "LMP test mode" [28]. This limits the vendors to
operate with only a few LMP procedures and therefore, the
vendors are unlikely to have full control over the messages
exchanged over all LMP procedures without expensive certi-
ﬁcation hardware. All BRAKTOOTH vulnerabilities V1-V16
involve speciﬁc mutation or duplication to create potentially
unexpected scenarios in the Bluetooth link manager (see Sec-
tion 8 for details). We postulate that due to the lack of tools (or
ﬂexibility thereof) to control all LMP procedures, BT devices
were not tested thoroughly on such uncommon scenarios. This
is also evident during our communication even with popular
BT vendors (e.g. Intel, Cypress, and Qualcomm). Speciﬁ-
cally, in contrast to our disclosure of SweynTooth [14] vul-
nerabilities, we experienced the following crucial differences:
1) The replication of BRAKTOOTH vulnerabilities involves
signiﬁcantly more interaction with the vendors. In the past,
our experience with BLE vendors suggests that they were
able to use in-house tools (without using our custom fuzzer)
to replicate the SweynTooth vulnerabilities. However, while
replicating BRAKTOOTH, vendors had to use the exact setup
used to discover BRAKTOOTH vulnerabilities. This involves
the usage of the ESP32 device, the custom LMP ﬁrmware and
the BRAKTOOTH PoC tool (see Figure 2). We believe such
is the case due to the lack of BT tooling for comprehensively
testing the security of Bluetooth link manager implementa-
tions under unexpected packet exchanges. Thankfully, our
PoC brings the control over LMP to the host, dismissing the
need to change the BT ﬁrmware just to create speciﬁc test
cases. This approach was inspired from our previous work
with the "SweynTooth Non-Compliant BLE Controller" [14].

Downstream dependency: During the responsible disclo-
sure period, we experienced that it is impossible for certain
BT module vendors to produce a patch due to their depen-
dency on downstream vendors. Speciﬁcally, this was observed
while reporting the vulnerability V6 (LMP 2-DH1 Overﬂow)
for Laird BT900 and BT820 SoC devices. A discussion with
Laird Technologies, Inc. revealed that the underlying LMP
Stack used by both BT900 (CSR8811) and BT820 (CSR8510)
devices is Stonestreet One’s Bluetopia stack (currently ac-
quired by Qualcomm) and the rectiﬁcation of V6 requires
the support of Qualcomm. After a discussion between our
team and Laird Connectivity, it was revealed (from Laird Con-
nectivity contacting Qualcomm internal support forum) that
the CSR8811 has no patch space available and therefore, the
vulnerability V6 is not possible to ﬁx. In other words, any de-
vices using CSR8811, including but not limited to BT900 and
BT820 SoC devices, are likely to remain vulnerable forever.
This clearly shows the complexity of resolving IoT vulner-
abilities due to the downstream dependencies on multiple
vendors. The implication of such a problem is not trivial to
gauge. Considering that certain devices may remain vulnera-
ble for a prolonged time, it is advised that the IoT module and
product vendors conduct a thorough risk assessment. This is

particularly important if the target module or product uses
a vulnerable component where patching is difﬁcult due to
software lock-down (similar to CSR8811).

Reverse engineering effort: During our research on Blue-
tooth Link Manager testing, we clearly observe the gap of
security testing tools to validate arbitrary BT devices. While
there exists emulation-based approaches [26], these works
need to spend signiﬁcant effort in reverse engineering the
target devices (if at all possible). The absence of any open
source and feature-complete Bluetooth LMP stack further
complicates the security testing problem. During our research,
we have designed a fuzzing interface by reverse-engineering
the ESP32 BT stack which is located in the static library
libbtdm_app.a [10] and ESP32 ROM memory. The reverse en-
gineering effort was utilized to design a (non-compliant) LMP
ﬁrmware that can be used off-the-shelf to validate any devices
with BR/EDR functionality. While the reverse-engineering
effort of a commodity BT stack was signiﬁcant, we believe
that the effort was fruitful and necessary in comprehensively
analysing the security of any BT implementations in the wild.
As discussed in the preceding paragraphs, we also experienced
that even major industries lack ﬂexible tools for comprehen-
sively testing BT Link Managers.

8 Vulnerabilities Description

In this section, we provide a detailed description of each vul-
nerability, the affected system-on-chip (SoC) models and the
SDKs where applicable. Some vulnerabilities were discov-
ered when testing developments kits and others were detected
by testing ﬁnal products (e.g. speakers or headphones).

8.1 V1: Feature Pages Execution

(CVE-2021-28139)

The Bluetooth Classic implementation in Espressif ESP-IDF
4.4 and earlier [8] does not properly restrict the Feature Page
upon reception of an LMP Feature Response Extended packet,
allowing attackers in radio range to trigger arbitrary code ex-
ecution (ACE) in ESP32 via a crafted Extended Features
bitﬁeld payload. As shown in Figure 6, the ACE vulnerabil-
ity is triggered by simply sending LMP_feature_res_ext with
an invalid feature page of 0x62 after LMP Setup procedure
(c.f., Figure 1). Moreover, the contents of extended features
in the LMP_feature_res_ext can be used to execute code at
an arbitrary address within the ESP32 ﬁrmware. For exam-
ple, as described in Section 4.1, such an address may point
to the erase function (nvs_ﬂash_erase) and disabling Wi-Fi
(disable_wiﬁ_agc), among others.

Impact: The attacker is able to execute arbitrary functions
implemented in the target ESP32’s ﬁrmware. Once the at-
tacker acquires a dump of ESP32 ﬁrmware and the memory
layout is known, functions at arbitrary addresses can be called.

This allows the attacker to erase user data (NVRAM), call I/O
functions that may control actuators, etc. Triggering ﬁrmware
crashes or a BT deadlock is also possible during repeated
attack attempts by executing invalid function addresses. In
case of a deadlock, the user needs to manually reset ESP32 to
restore BT communications.

Figure 6: Feature Page Execution

8.2 V2: Truncated SCO Link Request

(CVE-2021-34144)

The Bluetooth Classic implementation in the Zhuhai Jieli
AC6366C BT SDK 0.9.1 and earlier [35] does not properly
handle the reception of truncated LMP_SCO_Link_Request
packets while no other BT connections are active. This allows
attackers in radio range to prevent new BT connections (dis-
abling the AC6366C inquiry and page scan procedures) via
a crafted LMP packet. The user needs to manually perform
a power cycle (restart) of the device to restore BT commu-
nication. Following Figure 7, the attack can be launched by
sending an LMP_SCO_Link_Request with ACL length=2 in-
stead of its normal size of 7.

Impact: The attacker is able to prevent external parties to
connect to the device, requiring the user to manually perform
a power cycle on the device to resume normal connectiv-
ity. Attack risk is reduced if the user is already connected to
AC6366C or similar chipsets that only allow one active BT
connection at a time.

(CVE-2021-28136)

The Bluetooth Classic implementation in Espressif ESP-IDF
4.4 and earlier [8] does not properly handle the reception of
multiple LMP_IO_Capability_req packets during the pairing
process (see Figure 8). This allows attackers in radio range
to trigger memory corruption (and consequently a crash) in
ESP32 via a replayed (duplicated) LMP packet. The issue
was raised due to the sudden disconnection of ESP32 while
its bluedroid host stack was still in the pairing process. The
patch provided by Espressif rectiﬁes this issue by handling
a sudden disconnection during the pairing procedure (c.f.,
Table 5).

Impact: The attacker can exploit this vulnerability to
promptly cause ﬁrmware crashes and therefore maintain a
DoS while the attack is taking place. Since ESP32 restarts its
ﬁrmware by default upon receiving a fault, no user interaction
is needed to restore BT communication after the attack is
stopped.

Figure 8: Duplicated IOCAP

8.4 V4: Feature Response Flooding
(CVE-2021-28135/28155/31717)

The Bluetooth Classic implementation in Espressif ESP-IDF
4.4 and earlier [8] does not properly handle the reception of
continuous unsolicited LMP responses. This allows attackers
in radio range to trigger a denial of service (crash) in ESP32
by ﬂooding the target device with LMP Feature Response
data. As shown in Figure 9, LMP_features_res packets are
sent within a BT transmission slot of 1.25ms, which effec-
tively ﬂoods the Slave with unsolicited responses. This attack
vector is also effective against a range of other BT chipsets
such as JBL TUNE500BT [18] and Xiaomi MDZ-36-DB
(Actions Semi. ATS2815) [34, 37]. See Table 2 for all the
targets affected by V4.

Impact: The attack triggers a ﬁrmware crash on ESP32 and a
shutdown on JBL TUNE500BT and Xiaomi MDZ-36-DB.

9

In the case of a shutdown, the user needs to manually power
on the device again to restore communication. Furthermore,
since all targets accept multiple BT connections, the attack
can also be triggered while the target is already connected to
another device. For example, it is possible to immediately stop
audio from playing on JBL TUNE500BT and Xiaomi MDZ-
36-DB. The attacker, however, needs to know the BDAddress
of the target to launch the attack.

Figure 9: Feature Response Flooding

8.5 V5: LMP Auto Rate Overﬂow
(CVE-2021-31609/31612)

The Bluetooth Classic implementation in Silicon Labs
iWRAP 6.3.0 and earlier [19] does not properly handle
the reception of an oversized LMP packet greater than 17
bytes, allowing attackers in radio range to trigger a crash in
WT32i [20] via a crafted LMP packet. As shown in Figure 10,
the attack is triggered by sending an LMP with an ACL size
higher than 17 bytes. Normally this is not allowed by the BT
Core Speciﬁcation [27], but ESP32 radio can indeed send
such oversized LMP packets over the DM1 transport channel.
Our proof of concept (PoC) ﬁrmware bypasses some length
checks on the transmission path to make this possible. This
attack vector also works on some Jieli AC6905X (BT Audio
Receiver). Note that this attack requires sending this mal-
formed packet many times over many reconnections to trigger
a ﬁrmware crash. Particularly, a ﬁrmware crash on WT32i
may take around 3-5 minutes to be triggered.
Impact: The attack causes a ﬁrmware crash on both WT32i
and AC6905X. This can be used to cause a sporadic denial
of service (DoS) attacks on such devices.

8.6 V6: LMP 2-DH1 Overﬂow

(Pending CVE)

The Bluetooth Classic implementation on Laird CSR8811
A08 [24] and CSR8510 A10 [23] SoCs allows an LMP length
overﬂow over 2-DH1, resulting in a Deadlock (state machine
or packet handler corruption) outcome. Figure 11 captures the
sequence of messages exchanged to expose this vulnerability.

If the user is already
connected to AB5301A and the attack is started (multiple
BT connections are allowed), the active connection is not dis-
rupted, but new connections or reconnection is not possible.
As compared to V5 (Section 8.5), this attack works with any
overﬂown LMP packet rather than a speciﬁc LMP packet.
Impact: The impact of this attack is similar to V2 (Sec-
tion 8.2), in which connections to the target are not accepted
due to the page scan procedure being disabled after the attack
(see Figure 1). Therefore, the user needs to manually perform
a power cycle (restart) of the device to restore normal BT
connectivity.

Figure 12: LMP DM1 Overﬂow

8.8 V8: Truncated LMP Accepted

(CVE-2021-31613)

The Bluetooth Classic implementation on Zhuhai Jieli
AC690X and AC692X devices with unknown ﬁrmware does
not properly handle the reception of a truncated LMP packet
during LMP auto rate procedure, allowing attackers in radio
range to immediately crash (and restart) a device via a crafted
LMP packet. As depicted in Figure 13, an attacker sends a
malformed LMP_accepted just after the LMP Setup proce-
dure. This malformed packet has an ACL size of one byte,
rather than the expected 2 bytes for the opcode LMP_accepted.
The implementation of the target BT device does not prop-
erly reject such packets with a truncated size. This eventually
results in a ﬁrmware crash, which, in turn, triggers a prompt
restart.

As the BT implementation of the target is closed source,
the exact root cause of this vulnerability is not known. How-
ever, it is common that LMP procedures involving slot and
rate adjustments are usually implemented in an interrupt han-
dler different than other non-real-time LMP packets, such as
feature requests and version requests. Such a handler may
miss some checks which are present on the other handlers, ex-
plaining why some overﬂow/underﬂow attacks only work for
certain LMP packet opcodes. This split in the LMP handler is
present, for instance, in ESP32 BT implementation.
Impact: The impact is a denial of service due to a ﬁrmware
crash & restart. The overall risk of such an attack is reduced if

Figure 10: LMP Auto Rate Overﬂow

In particular, the attack is performed by changing the transport
type of the normal LMP packet to 2-DH1 and then adding
more bytes to the LMP payload. This, for example, results in
a total ACL length of 27.

Impact: The attack causes a BT deadlock on Laird CSR8811
and a ﬁrmware crash on CSR8510 operating as a standard BT
dongle. While the dongle ﬁrmware crash is automatically re-
covered by the OS, the deadlock requires the user to perform a
power cycle to restore normal BT communication. The attack
does not affect Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication
in CSR8811.

Figure 11: LMP 2-DH1 Overﬂow

8.7 V7: LMP DM1 Overﬂow
(CVE-2021-34150)

The Bluetooth Classic implementation on Bluetrum
AB5301A [5] (tested with AB32VG1 dev. kit [4]) with un-
speciﬁed ﬁrmware versions does not properly handle the re-
ception of oversized DM1 LMP packets. This allows attackers
in radio range to prevent new BT connections (disabling the
AB5301A inquiry and page scan procedures) via a crafted
LMP packet. Following Figure 12, an arbitrary LMP packet
(LMP_packet_type_table_req) is sent with an ACL length of
31, which is much higher than the expected 17 byte limit for
DM1 transport. Due to a lack of check of DM1 length, an
undeﬁned behaviour on the target baseband implementation
was observed. This eventually disables the paging scan proce-

handle the reception of multiple LMP_host_connection_req
as shown in Figure 15. This allows attackers in radio range to
trigger a denial of service (deadlock) if no user is connected
to the target. Manual user intervention is required to restart
the device and restore Bluetooth communication.

Impact: An attacker in radio range can exploit the vulnera-
bility to perform DoS and shutdown or restart products using
chipsets and products based on Actions ATS2815/ATS2819.
However, the impact of the attack is reduced as the vulnerabil-
ity is only exploited when no other user device is connected
to the target.

Figure 13: Truncated LMP Accepted

8.9 V9: Invalid Setup Complete

(CVE-2021-31611)

The Bluetooth Classic implementation on Zhuhai Jieli
AC690X and AC692X devices does not properly handle the
reception of an out-of-order LMP Setup procedure (c.f., Fig-
ure 1) followed by a malformed LMP packet.

This scenario is illustrated in Figure 14. The attacker sends
an unexpected (duplicated) LMP_setup_complete, followed
by a malformed LMP_features_req_ext with an invalid LMP
opcode such as 0x64. The behaviour seen in Figure 14 allows
attackers in radio range to deadlock a device via injecting
crafted LMP packets. Moreover, the user needs to manually
reboot the device to restore communication.

Impact: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform
a DoS. The overall risk of such an attack is reduced if AC690X
and AC692X do not allow multiple BT connections.

8.11 V11: Same Host Connection

(CVE-2021-31786)

The Bluetooth Classic Audio implementation on products
based on Actions ATS2815/ATS2819 [34] chipset may not
properly handle a connection attempt from a host with the
same BDAddress as the currently connected BT host. As
illustrated in Figure 16, by simply connecting to the target
device (BT Speaker) with a forged BDAddress that matches
the BDAddress of the originally connected host (Device A -
E0:D4:E8:19:C7:69), the target device triggers a disconnec-
tion and eventually deadlocks. This requires the user to reboot
the target device to restore BT functionality.

When reaching Actions Semi during the disclosure period,
the company has informed us that they recommend the prod-
uct vendors to only allow one audio BT connection. However,
when we tested an ATS chipset based product Xiaomi MDZ-
36-DB, we observed that multiple BT connections are allowed,
albeit only one device can play audio at a time. Normally, con-
nections with repeated host BDAddress are rejected on LMP
Setup procedure (c.f., Figure 1). However, this procedure is
successful when testing Xiaomi MDZ-36-DB with repeated
host BDAddress, leading the audio device to an undeﬁned
state.

Impact: An attacker in radio range can exploit this vulnerable
behaviour to perform DoS and intentionally deadlock the
target device.

8.12 V12: LMP AU Rand Flooding

(CVE-2021-31610/34149/34146/34143)

The Bluetooth Classic implementation on several chipsets
does not properly handle the reception of continuous unso-
licited LMP responses that trigger a heap overﬂow within
the BT ﬁrmware. This allows attackers in radio range to trig-
ger a denial of service (either restart or deadlock the device)
by ﬂooding a device with LMP_AU_rand packet as shown
in Figure 17. Only CC2564C [15] from Texas Instruments
enters a deadlock state, which requires user intervention to re-
cover. Additionally, use of TI Dual-mode Bluetooth Stack for
MSP432 [16] may temporarily hang the host MCU (MSP432)
during the attack.

Many major chipset vendors are affected by this attack as
shown in Table 2. This attack is similar to Feature Response
Flooding (Section 8.4), indicating that ﬂooding testing with
packets from certain LMP procedures may not have been well
tested. This may arise because the Core Speciﬁcations only al-
lows a limited LMP testing mode [28] that restricts the SoC to
work with only a few LMP packets. This, in turn, may restrict
the test ﬂexibility for BT vendors. Speciﬁcally, vendors may
have a limited capacity of tests that they can perform with
their production BT ﬁrmware, such as ﬂooding or sending
out-of-order packets during normal LMP procedures.

Impact: An attacker in radio range can exploit this vulnerable
behaviour to perform DoS and intentionally crash or deadlock
the target device.

(CVE-2021-34148)

The Bluetooth Classic implementation in the Cypress WICED
BT stack 2.9.0 [13] and earlier for CYW20735B1 [12] devices
does not properly handle the reception of LMP_max_slot with
a higher ACL Length (Length=31 as shown in Figure 19) after
completion of the LMP setup procedure. This allows attackers
in radio range to trigger a denial of service (ﬁrmware crash)
via a crafted LMP packet.

ity to perform DoS and intentionally crash the target device.

[30] chipsets do not properly handle the reception of a mal-
formed LMP timing accuracy response followed by multiple
re-connections to the target link slave. This allows attackers
to exhaust device BT resources. Eventually, the attacker can
trigger a crash or BT disturbance via multiple attempts of
sending a crafted LMP_timing_acc_response (i.e. LMP tim-
ing accuracy response) followed by a sudden reconnection to
the target with a random BDAddress.

As shown in Figure 20, the attacker needs to perform
a loop of reconnection and injection of the malformed
LMP_timing_acc_response until the target chipset gets un-
stable. This either triggers a ﬁrmware crash (in the case of
WCN3990 and CYW20735B1) or disconnects other active
BT devices (in the case of Intel AX200). The faster the recon-
nection is performed, the easier is for the attack to succeed in
disturbing other BT devices connected to the target chipset.

Impact: This attack causes a denial of service (DoS) attack.
Speciﬁcally, while the attack is in progress, the target devices
are unable to use the Bluetooth service normally.

The impact of this attack does not persist after the attack
stops. This is because the target normally tries to recover
the BT connection by performing a re-connection to previ-
ously disconnected devices (e.g., Intel AX200 under Linux
or Windows). In the case of a WCN3990 ﬁrmware crash, the
Android OS restarts the Bluetooth daemon and re-uploads
a ﬁrmware image to WCN3990. Finally, for CYW20735B1,
it restarts automatically upon any fault due to its watchdog
timer being enabled by default. Nevertheless, in all cases, it is
not possible to normally use the device while the attack is in
progress, as the BT connection can be disrupted continuously.
The attacker only needs to know the BDAddress of the target
device and no authentication is required to launch the attack.

8.16 V16: Paging Scan Disable

(Pending CVE)

This vulnerability is depicted in Figure 21. As shown in Fig-
ure 21, sending an invalid packet during the LMP timing
accuracy procedure (i.e. packet LMP_timing_acc_request),
followed by a forced re-connection with the same BDAddress

Figure 20: Invalid Timing Accuracy

(any arbitrary BDAdress of choice of the attacker), leads Intel
AX200 to reject any externally initiated BT connections for
an undetermined amount of time. This persists even after the
attack stops and requires user intervention to recover AX200
normal functionalities.

Figure 21 illustrates the attack, which, similarly to at-
tack V15 (Section 8.15), involves a loop of sending the
malformed packet throughout re-connections to trigger the
vulnerability. In contrast to V15, the attack is triggered be-
fore role switch procedure (see Figure 1), requires the same
BDAddress when initiating re-connections and injects a mal-
formed LMP_timing_acc_request with an oversized LMP
length greater than 17 bytes. As a reminder, the maximum
length limit of an LMP packet under DM1 channel is 17 bytes,
which suggests that oversized LMP packets are not correctly
handled by AX200 under a sudden disconnection scenario.

Furthermore, during the next re-connection, AX200 sends
an out-of-order response which does not correspond to the
original request. For instance, during the second re-connection
involved in the scenario captured in Figure 21, AX200 sends
LMP_version_res when receiving a feature request from the
attacker. This depicts anomaly A5 as listed in Table 2.

Finally, as a second side effect of the vulnerability, the user
may not be able to initiate as much BR/EDR connections as
AX200 originally supports even after the attack stops. For
example, the user is able to connect a maximum of only one
or two BR/EDR devices depending on when the vulnerability
is triggered. More speciﬁcally, if the vulnerability is triggered
when AX200 is not connected to any device, then the user can
only connect to one device. Otherwise, if AX200 is already
connected to a device when the vulnerability is triggered, then
AX200 can only connect to two devices.

Impact: Once the attack is triggered and successful, the at-
tacker can cause DoS via the following AX200 behaviours:
(I) paging scan is disabled, which prevents any external de-

This behaviour can be used to trick an user to connect to
the attacker’s BT hardware instead of the legitimate target
since AX200 paging scan is disabled; (II) Multiple active BT
connections cannot be performed from the target. The user
requires to manually restart the Bluetooth service to restore
normal BT behaviour. On Linux and Windows, BT is recov-
ered by disabling and enabling Bluetooth via their respective
conﬁguration menu.

Firmware crashes may be sporadically triggered on AX200
during the attacks, but no speciﬁc scenario was found to reli-
ably trigger such crashes all the time.
