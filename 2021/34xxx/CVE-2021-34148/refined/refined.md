The provided content is related to CVE-2021-34148.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is improper handling of the reception of `LMP_max_slot` packets with a higher ACL Length in the Cypress WICED BT stack 2.9.0 and earlier for CYW20735B1 devices. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when an `LMP_max_slot` packet with an ACL length of 31 is received after the completion of the LMP setup procedure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper bounds checking or validation of the ACL length field within the `LMP_max_slot` packet.
- The vulnerability is triggered after the LMP setup procedure has been completed, indicating a potential weakness in the handling of specific LMP procedures.
- The vulnerability affects the Cypress WICED BT stack, specifically version 2.9.0 and earlier, for CYW20735B1 devices, which suggests a weakness specific to that implementation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by triggering a firmware crash on the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed over-the-air (OTA) via a crafted Bluetooth LMP packet.
- The attacker sends a malformed `LMP_max_slot` packet with an oversized ACL length (31 bytes) after the LMP setup procedure has completed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be within radio range of the vulnerable device.
- The attacker needs to have the capability to send crafted LMP packets using a custom firmware and a tool to control the Bluetooth controller.
- The attacker does not require prior pairing or authentication to trigger this vulnerability.
