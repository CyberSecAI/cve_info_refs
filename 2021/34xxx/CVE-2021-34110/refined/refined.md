Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-34110:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Incorrect access control settings on the WinWaste.NET service executable and its associated directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure File Permissions:** The `WinWasteService.exe` executable, located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\WW.NET\WW.PROG\`, has overly permissive access control lists (ACLs). Specifically, the "Everyone" group has modify permissions on the executable file and the containing directory. This allows any local user to modify the file.
- **Service Running as LocalSystem:** The `WinWasteService` runs with `LocalSystem` privileges, which are the highest privileges on a Windows system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A local, unprivileged attacker can replace the legitimate `WinWasteService.exe` file with a malicious executable. When the service restarts (automatically or manually), the malicious code will execute with `LocalSystem` privileges. This grants the attacker complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local File Replacement:** The attacker needs local access to the system. They can then replace the vulnerable executable file (`WinWasteService.exe`) with their malicious file. The same method applies to DLL files which may be tied to the vulnerable executable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Access:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the target Windows system.
- **File System Access:** The attacker needs to be able to write files to the `C:\Program Files (x86)\WW.NET\WW.PROG\` directory, due to the overly permissive ACLs.

**Technical Details (From Exploit-DB):**

- The provided `icacls` and `cacls` commands outputs clearly shows the insecure file permissions.
- The `sc qc winwasteservice` output shows that the service runs as `LocalSystem`.

**More Detail Than CVE:**

- The provided content from Exploit-DB gives detailed technical information about the vulnerable service and the insecure file permissions that allowed the privilege escalation.
- The packetstormsecurity.com and nica.it content is not related to the vulnerability.
