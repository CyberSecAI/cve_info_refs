Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-34303:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing TIFF files within the `Tiff_Loader.dll` library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** Specifically, the lack of validation can result in a read operation that goes past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to leak sensitive information from the application's memory. This information is disclosed in the context of the current process.
*   The advisory mentions that this vulnerability can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities for arbitrary code execution, although this particular CVE only allows for information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File:** The primary attack vector is through a malicious TIFF file. The user must open this file using the vulnerable software (JT2Go or Teamcenter Visualization).
*   **User Interaction Required:** Exploiting this vulnerability requires user interaction, as the target must open a malicious file or visit a malicious page hosting the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious TIFF file that triggers the out-of-bounds read.
*   The attacker must trick a user into opening this malicious file with the vulnerable software.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The affected software includes Siemens JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization (all versions prior to V13.2).
*   The vulnerability is located within the `Tiff_Loader.dll` library, indicating a flaw in the TIFF parsing logic.
