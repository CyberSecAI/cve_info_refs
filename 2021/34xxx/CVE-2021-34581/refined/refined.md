- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing release of resources after their effective lifetime within the OpenSSL implementation on WAGO PLCs. Specifically, a series of crafted requests can trigger a resource exhaustion leading to a denial-of-service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper resource management, specifically a missing release of resources after use, which leads to a denial-of-service. This is a CWE-772 vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack causes the PLC to become non-operational and requires a power cycle (reset) to recover. This leads to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is network-based, utilizing specially crafted network requests to exploit the vulnerability in OpenSSL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated attacker with network access to the vulnerable WAGO PLC can trigger the vulnerability. The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction.
