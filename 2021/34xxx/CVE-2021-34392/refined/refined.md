- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Integer overflow in the `tz_map_shared_mem` function within the NVIDIA TLK kernel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow leads to a bypass of boundary checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access with user privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local user with the ability to trigger the vulnerable `tz_map_shared_mem` function. The attack requires user interaction and has high complexity.
