{
  "CVE-2021-34427": {
    "Description": "In Eclipse BIRT versions 4.8.0 and earlier, an attacker can use query parameters to create a JSP file which is accessible from remote (current BIRT viewer dir) to inject JSP code into the running instance.",
    "Root cause": "Improper input validation of the `__document` parameter allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file name, including JSP files, and inject code into it using the `sample` parameter.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation",
      "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution on the server running Eclipse BIRT. An attacker can execute arbitrary code by creating a JSP file with malicious content.",
    "Attack vectors": "HTTP requests with manipulated query parameters, specifically `__report`, `sample`, and `__document` parameters.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Eclipse BIRT instance. No authentication is required.",
    "Additional details": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a URL that creates a JSP file on the server.",
      "The initial fix implemented a blacklist/whitelist approach for allowed file extensions, but it was bypassed by adding `/.` to the end of the filename.",
      "The vulnerability is present in versions <= 4.11.0 and was fixed in version 4.12.",
      "The `sample` parameter is used to inject JSP code, and the `__document` parameter to specify the location and name of the created JSP file."
