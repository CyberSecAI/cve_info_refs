The provided content is related to CVE-2021-34816.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the plugin name when installing a plugin via the admin panel. The plugin name is directly passed as an argument to the `npm install` command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Argument Injection: The plugin name is used as an argument to a system command without sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution on the server.
- Complete compromise of the Etherpad instance and its data.
- Ability to steal, modify, or delete all data.
- Ability to target other internal systems reachable from the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with admin privileges can install a malicious plugin.
- The attacker can specify a malicious package from the NPM repository or a URL pointing to a package on their server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have admin privileges on the Etherpad instance. This is not a default configuration, but an administrator account must exist.
