{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Enbra EWM software does not properly handle replay attacks when exporting data to CSV. While the software displays the correct timestamp from the meter data, the exported CSV uses the system time of the readout, losing the ability to detect replay attacks based on time discrepancies.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (CWE-345)",
    "Replay attack vulnerability in Wireless M-Bus Security mode 5",
    "Lack of proper timestamp handling during data export"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can replay previously captured messages to spoof consumption data, leading to lower billing amounts for the user. The lack of proper timestamp handling in the exported data prevents detection of these replay attacks after the data is exported from the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker needs to be within radio range of the wireless meters to intercept and replay messages.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to intercept messages from the meters and replay them at a later time. They also need to be able to manipulate the replay to be faster than the meter's messages during a readout."
