Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-34881

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the parsing of OBJ files in Bentley View and MicroStation. It is caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, where the software attempts to read data from a memory location beyond the allocated buffer. This occurs when processing a maliciously crafted OBJ file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The out-of-bounds read can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although the primary vulnerability is information disclosure, the advisory mentions that an attacker could leverage this vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious OBJ File:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious OBJ file with specific data that triggers the out-of-bounds read when parsed by the vulnerable software.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must interact with the malicious file by either visiting a malicious page or opening the file directly, indicating a need for user interaction for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious OBJ file.
*   The attacker must induce the victim to open or parse the malicious OBJ file with the vulnerable software (Bentley View or MicroStation).

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
*   Bentley has released updates to mitigate this vulnerability in MicroStation and Bentley View, versions 10.16.02.\* and later.
*   The vendor advises users to only open OBJ files from trusted sources.
