| Hi,  There is null pointer dereference in function bitstr\_tell() and bitstr\_close() in bitstr.c. Didn't check whether the stream is valid .  ``` long bitstr_tell(void *stream) {     int type = *(int*)stream;     if (!stream) return EOF;    ... }  int bitstr_close(void *stream) {     int type = *(int*)stream;    ... }  ```  **version** [4ab404e](https://github.com/rockcarry/ffjpeg/commit/4ab404eb87fe039d6cfba121d2ba572fb060e623) (latest one)  **env** ubuntu 20.04 x86\_64 gcc version 9.3.0  **reproduce:** make ./ffjpeg -e poc [zipped poc](https://github.com/rockcarry/ffjpeg/files/6471461/null_pointer_bitstr_tell.zip)  \*\*debug info \*\*  ``` ─── code:x86:64 ────    0x555555555a57 <bitstr_tell+8>  sub    rsp, 0x20    0x555555555a5b <bitstr_tell+12> mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x18], rdi    0x555555555a5f <bitstr_tell+16> mov    rax, QWORD PTR [rbp-0x18]  → 0x555555555a63 <bitstr_tell+20> mov    eax, DWORD PTR [rax]    0x555555555a65 <bitstr_tell+22> mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4], eax    0x555555555a68 <bitstr_tell+25> cmp    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x18], 0x0    0x555555555a6d <bitstr_tell+30> jne    0x555555555a78 <bitstr_tell+41>    0x555555555a6f <bitstr_tell+32> mov    rax, 0xffffffffffffffff    0x555555555a76 <bitstr_tell+39> jmp    0x555555555aa9 <bitstr_tell+90> ── threads ──── [#0] Id 1, Name: "ffjpeg-ggdb", stopped 0x555555555a63 in bitstr_tell (), reason: SINGLE STEP ─ trace ──── [#0] 0x555555555a63 → bitstr_tell(stream=0x0) [#1] 0x55555555b866 → jfif_encode(pb=0x7fffffffe290) [#2] 0x5555555574f6 → main() ──── gef➤  i r rax rax            0x0                 0x0   ``` |
