Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-34926:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the parsing of JT files in Bentley View.
- Specifically, crafted data within a JT file can trigger a write past the end of an allocated buffer. This is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The software attempts to write data beyond the boundaries of an allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This allows them to potentially take full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious JT file: An attacker crafts a malicious JT file containing specific data designed to trigger the out-of-bounds write.
- User interaction: The target user must open the malicious JT file. This could involve visiting a malicious page that serves the file or directly opening a file received through other means (email, download, etc.).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create malicious JT files: The attacker needs to have the ability to create a JT file containing the specific crafted data.
- Social engineering or other method of delivery: The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious file. This could be done through phishing emails, malicious websites, or other means of file distribution.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Bentley on August 16, 2021, and publicly disclosed on December 8, 2021.
-  Bentley released an update (version 10.16.02.* and later) to mitigate the issue in both MicroStation and Bentley View.
- Multiple other related vulnerabilities were discovered and addressed in the same advisory, all relating to out-of-bounds writes and use-after-free issues while handling JT files.
