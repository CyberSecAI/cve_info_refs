- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation of a crafted JSON request sent to the `/auth/access-token` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-20, Improper Input Validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Sending a specially crafted JSON request can cause the controller to restart, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted JSON request to the `/auth/access-token` endpoint over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable PLCnext controller. No authentication or user interaction is required.
