Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-889af802f2

Name : opendmarc
Product : Fedora 34
Version : 1.4.1.1
Release : 3.fc34
URL : <http://www.trusteddomain.org/opendmarc.html>
Summary : A Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC) milter and library
Description :
OpenDMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)
provides an open source library that implements the DMARC verification
service plus a milter-based filter application that can plug in to any
milter-aware MTA, including sendmail, Postfix, or any other MTA that supports
the milter protocol.

The DMARC sender authentication system is still a draft standard, working
towards RFC status.

The database schema required for some functions is provided in
/usr/share/opendmarc/db. The rddmarc tools are provided in
/usr/share/opendmarc/contrib/rddmarc.

| Hi, yesterday and today OpenDMARC has crashed for segfault half a dozen times on two virtual machines, one of them CentOS7, another CentOS8, both up-to-date and have OpenDKIM version 1.4.1. Before yesterday OpenDMARC and libopendmarc version 1.3.2 was installed and they worked fine.  Last dmesg info was `[Tue Jun 8 11:19:32 2021] opendmarc[11107]: segfault at 0 ip 00007fa89690c327 sp 00007fa88ffdb1a8 error 4 in libc-2.17.so[7fa8967c5000+1c4000]`  Red Hat Abrtd service was running, there is coredump and other files saved by it. Is there some additional information you would need to investigate the issue?  The package version is opendmarc-1.4.1-1.el7.x86\_64 on CentOS7 and opendmarc-1.4.1-1.el8.x86\_64 on CentOS8. |

| I have difficulties deciphering this, but if I had to go out on a limb this looks like a NULL dereference here: <https://github.com/trusteddomainproject/OpenDMARC/blob/rel-opendmarc-1-4-1/opendmarc/opendmarc.c#L2480>  This is the fix for [CVE-2019-16378](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x9f6-xw7x-fm76 "CVE-2019-16378"). If OpenDMARC can now be crashed with a multi-value `From` input then that fix just opened a new hole (DoS). Would be good to have a repro. Then someone file a new CVE if necessary ... |

| I could reproduce the problem and have pushed another commit at [#178](https://github.com/trusteddomainproject/OpenDMARC/pull/178). Please apply and try patch <https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/trusteddomainproject/OpenDMARC/pull/178.patch>.  Please someone file a CVE, I don't have the energy right now. OpenDMARC 1.4.1.1 is a sitting duck and can be shot down by anyone at any time. |

| It's an easy compile and install on Centos 8. [@glts](https://github.com/glts) Has it been merged into 'develop' stream yet?  Standard OpenDMARC on CentOS is EPEL package, and the 'develop' version can be compiled and run alongside it as it installs to /usr/local.  On my mail server (RHEL 8) I have both installed, and can switch between them. To do so, do this from a working directory somewhere:  ``` git clone https://github.com/trusteddomainproject/OpenDMARC cd OpenDMARC git checkout develop autoreconf -v -i ./configure --with-spf --with-spf2-include=/usr/include/spf2/ --with-spf2-lib=/usr/lib64/ make make install  ```  Copy /etc/opendmarc.conf to /etc/opendmarc-new.conf, and create a new systemd file at /usr/lib/systemd/system/opendmarc-new.service, with updates to PIDFile, EnvironmentFile and ExecStart:  ``` PIDFile=/var/run/opendmarc/opendmarc-new.pid EnvironmentFile=-/etc/sysconfig/opendmarc-new ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/opendmarc $OPTIONS  ```  Create the environment file and edit to match.  In the config file at /etc/opendmarc-new.conf, use a different port for socket - I use `Socket inet:8894@localhost`  ...then make sure Postfix or whatever MTA you use is configured accordingly. E.g. in Postfix I have:  ``` ### Milter ports ### # 8890 = spf-milter     (glts, new testing - https://gitlab.com/glts/spf-milter) # 8891 = OpenDKIM # 8892 = OpenARC        (beta) # 8893 = OpenDMARC      EPEL stable (currently 1.4.1) # 8894 = OpenDMARC-new  (1.4.1 develop from git)  # spf-milter, DKIM, ARC, DMARC (1.4.1 git): smtpd_milters           = inet:127.0.0.1:8890,                                      inet:127.0.0.1:8891,                                      inet:127.0.0.1:8892,                                      inet:127.0.0.1:8894  ```  Enable the new service `systemctl enable --now opendmarc-new`  ... and check. |

| Hello [@glts](https://github.com/glts)  Thank you for the patch.  I've rebuilt the RPM (from the EPEL source RPM) adding the 178 patch + using tag rel-opendmarc-1-4-1-1 tar.gz We were having 20-30 segfaults per day (I've used monit to monitor the process and restart it when it dies). I'll report if the segfaults are still occuring with the patch.  Kind regards. |

| We were hit with this issue today as part of routine patching. We had to back out to previous version.  Does anyone have a concrete example I can use to trigger this problem? Simply specifying something like follows only causes a log message "multi-valued From field detected" but no crash:  From: UserA usera@domaina.com, UserB userb@domainb.com  I also tried leaving the domain part of of both to no avail, and actually got this error instead:  RFC 5322 requirement error: missing From field; accepting |

| Thank you [@glts](https://github.com/glts) -- I was able to duplicate with 1.4.1. I was literally leaving off just the domain parts, as in:  From: UserA usera@, UserB userb@  Once I removed the "@" characters it crashed as expected. Now we have a verification method after we upgrade to the latest version. |

/usr/share/opendmarc/contrib/rddmarc.

This change fixes the broken reject logic when a multi-value `From` header field is detected. It also adds a guard against deref of NULL domains ([CVE-2021-34555](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9774-4j5q-whvj "CVE-2021-34555"), see [#179](https://github.com/trusteddomainproject/OpenDMARC/issues/179)).

It includes an unrelated addition, namely the missing if-guard before the syslog call, as is done elsewhere in this function.

This fixes [#175](https://github.com/trusteddomainproject/OpenDMARC/issues/175).

This fixes [#179](https://github.com/trusteddomainproject/OpenDMARC/issues/179).

| This should fix the crash (DoS vuln) reported in [#179](https://github.com/trusteddomainproject/OpenDMARC/issues/179). Please review and modify/merge.  I understand that you don’t have the resources to maintain this project. Still, if you can find half an hour to look this over and comment on it we can apply the patch in distros. |

### **[mskucherawy](/mskucherawy)** commented [Dec 20, 2021](#issuecomment-997581562)

| The patch contains a redundant check for "domains[0] != NULL" on new line 2477; this is already tested on line 2468.  There's a deeper problem here, which is that the caller doesn't actually know how far into that array it needs to go. The "domains" array could be 10 entries long, but with a NULL in the middle, which will short-circuit further checks. |
