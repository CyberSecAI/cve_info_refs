| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | Siemens |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [JT2Go](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/plm-components/jt2go.html) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Siemens JT2Go. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of J2K files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |

SSA-483182: Multiple File Parsing Vulnerabilities in JT2Go and
Teamcenter Visualization before V13.2

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

2021-07-13
2021-07-13
V1.0

SUMMARY

Siemens has released version V13.2 for JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization to ﬁx multiple vulnerabilities
that could be triggered when the products read ﬁles in different ﬁle formats (GIF, TIFF, BMP, J2K, JT,
SGI, PDF, PCT, PCX, PAR and ASM ). If a user is tricked to opening of a malicious ﬁle with the affected
products, this could lead to application crash, or potentially arbitrary code execution on the target host
system.

Siemens recommends to update to the latest versions and to limit opening of untrusted ﬁles from unknown
sources in the affected products.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

JT2Go:

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Avoid to open untrusted ﬁles from unknown sources in JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

(PLM) environment with a comprehensive family of visualization solutions. The software enables enter-
prise users to access documents, 2D drawings and 3D models in a single environment.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-34333

The BMP_Loader.dll library in affected applications lacks proper validation of user-supplied data
when parsing BMP ﬁles. A malformed input ﬁle could result in double free of an allocated buffer that
leads to a crash. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to cause denial of service condition.
