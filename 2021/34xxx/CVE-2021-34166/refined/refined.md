The provided content describes an authentication bypass vulnerability in "Simple Food Website 1.0", a PHP web application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the login process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- SQL Injection: The application directly uses user-supplied input (username) within an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, allowing for SQL injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Authentication Bypass: An attacker can bypass the login authentication mechanism and gain administrative access by injecting a SQL payload that always evaluates to true.

**Attack vectors:**

- HTTP POST Request: The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `process_login.php` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- Network Access: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- Basic Understanding of SQL injection: The attacker needs to inject the specific SQL payload ` ' or '1'='1'# ` into the username field.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit demonstrates how to perform the SQL injection. The attacker modifies the `username` parameter in the POST request to:
```
username=' or '1'='1'#
```
This payload when included in the SQL query, will always resolve to true, allowing the attacker to bypass authentication.
The password can be any value.
