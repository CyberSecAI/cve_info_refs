Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2021-34066:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The issue report explicitly states "There is a Deserialization vulnerability that can execute system command." This indicates that the vulnerability stems from insecure deserialization of data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of an insecure deserialization process. This typically happens when an application deserializes untrusted data without proper validation or sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The report explicitly mentions that the deserialization vulnerability "can execute system command." This clearly indicates the possibility of arbitrary code execution on the server, which would give an attacker complete control over the vulnerable system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Deserialization of malicious data:** The attacker would need to send crafted, malicious serialized data to the vulnerable application. This malicious data, when deserialized, would trigger the execution of attacker-controlled system commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to send crafted input:** The attacker needs the capability to send serialized malicious data to the vulnerable endpoint. The specific position would depend on the application and the location of the vulnerable deserialization process, but could include network access to an API or web endpoint.
