| **Describe the set-up**   * Software:   + STM32Cube MCU & MPU Packages * Version:   + STM32Cube\_FW\_H7\_V1.8.0 * Verification Hardware Platform:   + STM32H7B3   **Describe the bug**   * Function:    + static void USBH\_ParseCfgDesc(USBH\_CfgDescTypeDef \*cfg\_desc, uint8\_t \*buf, uint16\_t length) * Location:    + [STM32CubeH7/Middlewares/ST/STM32\_USB\_Host\_Library/Core/Src/usbh\_ctlreq.c](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/blob/79196b09acfb720589f58e93ccf956401b18a191/Middlewares/ST/STM32_USB_Host_Library/Core/Src/usbh_ctlreq.c#L399)  Line 399     in     [79196b0](/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/commit/79196b09acfb720589f58e93ccf956401b18a191)           |  | cfg\_desc->bmAttributes = \*(uint8\_t \*)(buf + 7); |     | --- | --- | * Type:    + Denial-of-Service. * Result:    + The system will hang when trying to set a remote wake-up feature. * Description:    + The function USBH\_ParseCfgDesc() parses the configuration descriptor, interface descriptor, and endpoint descriptor by input data from a USB device.   + And it set the variable cfg\_desc->bmAttributes by the input data from the USB device. This variable will be used as part of a judgment in the function USBH\_Process() as shown in       [STM32CubeH7/Middlewares/ST/STM32\_USB\_Host\_Library/Core/Src/usbh\_core.c](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/blob/79196b09acfb720589f58e93ccf956401b18a191/Middlewares/ST/STM32_USB_Host_Library/Core/Src/usbh_core.c#L643)  Line 643     in     [79196b0](/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/commit/79196b09acfb720589f58e93ccf956401b18a191)           |  | if ((phost->device.CfgDesc.bmAttributes) & (1U << 5)) |     | --- | --- |                    . With a malformed value, the remote wakeup may be enabled as shown in       [STM32CubeH7/Middlewares/ST/STM32\_USB\_Host\_Library/Core/Src/usbh\_core.c](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/blob/79196b09acfb720589f58e93ccf956401b18a191/Middlewares/ST/STM32_USB_Host_Library/Core/Src/usbh_core.c#L643)  Line 643     in     [79196b0](/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/commit/79196b09acfb720589f58e93ccf956401b18a191)           |  | if ((phost->device.CfgDesc.bmAttributes) & (1U << 5)) |     | --- | --- |                    . If the hardware doesn’t support this feature, the system will hang due to a FAIL return value by the function USBH\_HandleControl().   **How To Reproduce**   1. Running MSC\_Standalone application on the STM32H7B3I platform 2. Plug a USB disk 3. Use the attached Bug4.txt to replace the USB device packet. [Bug4.txt](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/files/5381270/Bug4.txt)   **Additional context**   * To patch it, the program should check if the hardware supports a remote wake-up feature. |

| Hi [@TheSilentDawn](https://github.com/TheSilentDawn),  Thank you for this other report. If I understood the idea we should ensure that the software embedded within the *host* checks whether the value *bmAttributes* provided by the *device* is correct? Which reference should the *host* base itself on to perform such a check? Should we not assume the data provided by the *device* is correct?  Otherwise, when to stop checking? In case the *host* has a reference to base itself on, then would it not also make sense to check the validity of this reference too?  I hope my questions make sense. My goal is to be sure I understood correctly your point before reporting it to our development teams. I am looking forward to reading your reply. Thank you again.  With regards, |

| Hi [@ALABSTM](https://github.com/ALABSTM), No, I think the software embedded within the host should check if the hardware or the board supports or enables the wake-up feature. If not, the firmware shouldn't check bmAttributes as the current logic which will lead the whole system to hang. And to patch it, the wake-up feature checking codes should be added before the bmAttributes is accessed in the function and position reported upper. If anything not clear, please let me know. Thanks for your help.^\_^ |

| Hi [@TheSilentDawn](https://github.com/TheSilentDawn),  Please allow me this couple of questions:   * Is there any way for the host to check whether the device supports the wake-up feature other than the `bmAttributes` read from the device descriptor? * You mentioned *"the wake-up feature checking codes"*. Are you referring to some piece of code already present in our source files that should be moved before the reading of the `bmAttributes`?   Thank you, |
