The provided content describes a vulnerability in the STM32CubeH7 USB host library related to handling remote wake-up features.

**Root Cause:** The `USBH_ParseCfgDesc` function parses the USB configuration descriptor and extracts the `bmAttributes` field from the USB device. This field indicates whether the device supports remote wake-up. The host uses this information to enable remote wake-up, without first verifying if the *host* hardware itself supports wake-up. If the hardware does not support it, a subsequent call to `USBH_HandleControl()` will fail and cause the system to hang. The vulnerability is caused by the lack of hardware wake-up support checking in the host firmware before enabling the remote wake-up feature, and relying solely on the device provided value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper input validation: The host doesn't validate whether its hardware supports remote wake-up before acting on the `bmAttributes` value provided by the USB device.
- Reliance on untrusted data: The host trusts the device-provided `bmAttributes` value without verifying its own hardware capabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial-of-service: If a malicious or faulty USB device provides a `bmAttributes` value that enables remote wake-up, and the host hardware doesn't support it, the host system hangs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious USB device: An attacker can use a specially crafted USB device that presents a malformed configuration descriptor with the remote wake-up bit set in the `bmAttributes` field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to connect a malicious USB device to the vulnerable host.
