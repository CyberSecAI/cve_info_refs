The provided content relates to CVE-2021-34337.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from using basic string equality to check the REST API password. This approach is susceptible to timing attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The use of basic string equality for password comparison creates a timing side-channel vulnerability. The time taken to perform the comparison varies depending on the position of the first incorrect character.

**Impact of exploitation:** By measuring the time it takes to get a response, an attacker can deduce the correct password character by character, effectively bypassing the authentication mechanism.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to interact with the REST API directly to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the REST API. The commit message also notes that by default the REST API is bound to localhost. Therefore, the attacker would have to either compromise the host or have the API exposed to other interfaces.
