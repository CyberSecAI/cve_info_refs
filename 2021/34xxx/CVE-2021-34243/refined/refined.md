The provided content describes a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in ICE Hrm Version 29.0.0.OS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the file upload feature of ICE Hrm, where it fails to properly sanitize or validate user-uploaded files, specifically XML files containing malicious SVG code with embedded JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization/validation on file uploads.
- Allowing the upload of SVG files with embedded javascript.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript into the application, which can then be executed in the browsers of other users who access the uploaded file. This can lead to:
    - Stealing cookies
    - Stealing passwords
    - Running arbitrary code on a victim's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
- Uploading a specially crafted XML file with an embedded SVG tag containing a JavaScript payload via the "Employees=>Document Management" file upload feature.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the ICE Hrm Admin Panel.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to upload files through the "Employees=>Document Management" functionality.
