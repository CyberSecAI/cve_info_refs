Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-34697:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from incorrect programming within the Protection Against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks feature of Cisco IOS XE Software. Specifically, the half-opened connections limit, TCP SYN flood limit, or TCP SYN cookie features are not correctly implemented when configured in vulnerable software releases.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Incorrect programming of DDoS protection features leading to misconfiguration of half-open connection limits, TCP SYN flood limits, and TCP SYN cookies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to conduct a denial-of-service (DoS) attack to or through the affected device.
- Successful exploitation results in disruption of service to/through the device, likely making it unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is network-based.
- An attacker exploits the vulnerability by attempting to flood traffic to or through the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker does not need authentication or specific privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to or through the targeted device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco IOS XE Software releases 17.3.1 and later (but earlier than the first fixed release) if the software is in autonomous or controller mode and has one of the following enabled:
    - Half-opened connections limit
    - TCP SYN flood limit
    - TCP SYN cookie feature
- The specific configuration commands to enable the vulnerable features include: `max-incomplete`, `max-incomplete tcp`, `max-incomplete udp`, `max-incomplete icmp`, `max-incomplete high`, `max-incomplete low`, `tcp max-incomplete host`, `tcp syn-flood limit`, and `tcp syn-flood rate per-destination`.
- The `show platform hardware qfp active feature firewall runtime` command can be used to check if the data plane is correctly programmed. If correctly programmed the output should include the `half-open`, `syn-flood`, or `syn-cookie` flags.
- There are no workarounds available.
- Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability.
- Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products: IOS Software, IOS XR Software, Meraki products, and NX-OS Software.
- The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
- Cisco assigned a CVSS base score of 5.8 with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L
