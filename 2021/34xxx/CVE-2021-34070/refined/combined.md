### **[cemonatk](/cemonatk)** commented [May 24, 2021](#issue-899655214)

| Greetings,  tsMuxer has an Out-of-bounds Read issue whenever runs with the PoC sample.  Found by **Cem Onat Karagun of Diesec**  System info：  ``` Ubuntu 21.04 tsMuxeR version git-f6ab2a2  ```  To run PoC after unzip:  ``` $ ./tsmuxer global_oob  ```  [global\_oob.zip](https://github.com/justdan96/tsMuxer/files/6532598/global_oob.zip)  Chronological Function-Call Trace:   1. detectStreamReader(char const\*, MPLSParser\*, bool) /src/build/../tsMuxer/main.cpp:120:34 2. METADemuxer::DetectStreamReader(BufferedReaderManager&, std::\_\_cxx11::basic\_string<char, std::char\_traits, std::allocator > const&, bool) /src/build/../tsMuxer/metaDemuxer.cpp:684:35 3. METADemuxer::detectTrackReader(unsigned char\*, int, AbstractStreamReader::ContainerType, int, int) /src/build/../tsMuxer/metaDemuxer.cpp:765:21 4. VC1StreamReader::checkStream(unsigned char\*, int) /src/build/../tsMuxer/vc1StreamReader.cpp:146:28 5. VC1SequenceHeader::decode\_sequence\_header() /src/build/../tsMuxer/vc1Parser.cpp:156:20 6. VC1SequenceHeader::decode\_sequence\_header\_adv() /src/build/../tsMuxer/vc1Parser.cpp:279:37  Root Cause of The Issue: Constant integer arrays are defined in vc1Parser.h:  ``` line 39, 40: const int ff_vc1_fps_nr[5] = {24, 25, 30, 50, 60}; const int ff_vc1_fps_dr[2] = {1000, 1001}; ```  However, the array index nr is set to 7 therefore [nr-1] is larger than boundary of array ff\_vc1\_fps\_nr.  ``` (gdb) b *0x0000000000934072 Breakpoint 7 at 0x934072: file ../tsMuxer/vc1Parser.cpp, line 274.  (gdb) p nr $7 = 7  (gdb) p ff_vc1_fps_nr $8 = {24, 25, 30, 50, 60}  (gdb) p ff_vc1_fps_dr $17 = {1000, 1001}  line 276: if (nr && nr < 8 && dr && dr < 3)  line: 279: time_base_den = ff_vc1_fps_nr[nr - 1] * 1000; ```  A similar "demo" issue is also shared in following page: <https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerExampleGlobalOutOfBounds>  I'm sharing the link above, because ASAN declares this issue as "global-buffer-overflow" but as shared in References and root-cause sections this is actually a OOB read issue. Recommendation: Editing size-check of "array index" within "if condition" in line 276 might fix this "particular" issue. An additional check of index variables (dr and nr) for ">= 0" is **recommended**. PoC Fix: ``` - if (nr && nr < 8 && dr && dr < 3) + if (nr && nr < 5 && nr >= 0 && dr && dr < 3 && dr >= 0) ``` References: <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html> Address Sanitizer Output: ``` tsMuxeR version git-f6ab2a2. github.com/justdan96/tsMuxer ================================================================= ==1861865==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: global-buffer-overflow on address 0x000000299234 at pc 0x00000093540f bp 0x7fffda9f6e10 sp 0x7fffda9f6e08 READ of size 4 at 0x000000299234 thread T0     #0 0x93540e in VC1SequenceHeader::decode_sequence_header_adv() /src/build/../tsMuxer/vc1Parser.cpp:279:37     #1 0x93264d in VC1SequenceHeader::decode_sequence_header() /src/build/../tsMuxer/vc1Parser.cpp:156:20     #2 0x940715 in VC1StreamReader::checkStream(unsigned char*, int) /src/build/../tsMuxer/vc1StreamReader.cpp:146:28     #3 0x6d090e in METADemuxer::detectTrackReader(unsigned char*, int, AbstractStreamReader::ContainerType, int, int) /src/build/../tsMuxer/metaDemuxer.cpp:765:21     #4 0x6c7255 in METADemuxer::DetectStreamReader(BufferedReaderManager&, std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&, bool) /src/build/../tsMuxer/metaDemuxer.cpp:684:35     #5 0x5df87e in detectStreamReader(char const*, MPLSParser*, bool) /src/build/../tsMuxer/main.cpp:120:34     #6 0x5efd05 in main /src/build/../tsMuxer/main.cpp:698:17     #7 0x7f5f89b14564 in __libc_start_main csu/../csu/libc-start.c:332:16     #8 0x2ebded in _start (/home/X/tsMuxer/bin/tsMuxeR+0x2ebded)  0x000000299234 is located 44 bytes to the left of global variable '<string literal>' defined in '../tsMuxer/bitStream.h:131:9' (0x299260) of size 15   '<string literal>' is ascii string 'num <= INT_BIT' 0x000000299234 is located 0 bytes to the right of global variable 'ff_vc1_fps_nr' defined in '../tsMuxer/vc1Parser.h:39:11' (0x299220) of size 20 SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: global-buffer-overflow /src/build/../tsMuxer/vc1Parser.cpp:279:37 in VC1SequenceHeader::decode_sequence_header_adv() Shadow bytes around the buggy address:   0x00008004b1f0: f9 f9 f9 f9 00 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 00 02 f9 f9   0x00008004b200: f9 f9 f9 f9 00 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 00 06 f9 f9   0x00008004b210: f9 f9 f9 f9 03 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 00 05 f9 f9   0x00008004b220: f9 f9 f9 f9 00 02 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 00 00 00 00   0x00008004b230: 00 00 00 00 00 00 03 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 00 f9 f9 f9 =>0x00008004b240: f9 f9 f9 f9 00 00[04]f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 00 07 f9 f9   0x00008004b250: f9 f9 f9 f9 00 00 07 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 00 00 00 00   0x00008004b260: 00 05 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x00008004b270: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x00008004b280: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x00008004b290: 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 f9 f9 f9 f9 f9 06 f9 f9 f9 Shadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):   Addressable:           00   Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07    Heap left redzone:       fa   Freed heap region:       fd   Stack left redzone:      f1   Stack mid redzone:       f2   Stack right redzone:     f3   Stack after return:      f5   Stack use after scope:   f8   Global redzone:          f9   Global init order:       f6   Poisoned by user:        f7   Container overflow:      fc   Array cookie:            ac   Intra object redzone:    bb   ASan internal:           fe   Left alloca redzone:     ca   Right alloca redzone:    cb   Shadow gap:              cc ==1861865==ABORTING  ``` |

| Hi [@cemonatk](https://github.com/cemonatk) , thank you for all these bug busting ;) The code actually comes from ffmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/2.7/vc1data_8c_source.html#l00087> <https://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/2.7/vc1_8c_source.html#l00479>  I will push the fix accordingly. |
