{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data in the SOAPAction HTTP header before copying it to a fixed-length buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution with the privileges of the affected service.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-adjacent attacker sending a crafted HTTP request with an overly long SOAPAction header.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Network-adjacent access is required. No authentication is needed."
