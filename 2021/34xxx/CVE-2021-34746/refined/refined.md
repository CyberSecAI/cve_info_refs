{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Incomplete validation of user-supplied input passed to an authentication script.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The TACACS+ authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) feature of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) does not properly validate user-supplied input.",
      "The authentication script `/usr/bin/ext_auth.sh` is vulnerable to parameter injection due to insufficient input sanitization.",
      "The `/usr/bin/auth_hash.py` script, used for TACACS authentication with `maapi` or `rest` context, is susceptible to command injection via the `user` and `password` variables.",
      "The usage of character sequences like ';;;rest' within passwords allows control flow to be altered."
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass authentication and log in to an affected device as an administrator.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks",
      "Parameter injection in authentication requests to bypass authentication checks"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted authentication requests to the vulnerable device. No prior authentication is required.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability affects Cisco Enterprise NFVIS Release 4.5.1 if the TACACS external authentication method is configured. Proof-of-concept exploit code is publicly available. The vulnerability can be exploited via SSH CLI, Netconf and HTTPS. Configurations using RADIUS or local authentication are not affected."
