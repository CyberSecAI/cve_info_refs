Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-34998:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper use of named pipes within Panda Security Free Antivirus. Specifically, the issue arises from allowing an untrusted process to impersonate the client of a pipe.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Impersonation:** The core vulnerability lies in the application's failure to properly validate or restrict which processes can impersonate a client connecting to its named pipe. This allows a malicious, low-privileged process to pose as a legitimate client.
- **Unnecessary Privileges:** The application grants more privileges than necessary, as the vulnerability allows a low-privileged attacker to gain SYSTEM level access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit allows a local attacker to escalate their privileges from a low-privileged context to the SYSTEM level.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By achieving SYSTEM level access, the attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code with the highest privileges on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires the attacker to already have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. This could be achieved through various means, such as exploiting another vulnerability or through social engineering.
- **Named Pipes:** The vulnerability is specifically triggered through the use of named pipes and the ability to impersonate the client connecting to the pipe.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Code Execution:** The attacker must be able to execute code on the target system, even with low privileges.
- **Knowledge of Named Pipe:** The attacker needs knowledge of the named pipe mechanism used by the vulnerable application and the ability to manipulate or interact with it.

**Additional Details:**
- Panda Security has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Michael DePlante (@izobashi) of Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
- The advisory was released on November 29, 2021, with the vulnerability reported to the vendor on June 25, 2021.
