  "response": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to missing length validation checks when processing LLDP messages.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing length validation checks when processing LLDP messages leading to an out-of-bounds read."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an out-of-bounds read of the valid LLDP packet data, which could allow the attacker to cause corruption in the internal LLDP database of the affected device.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious LLDP packet to the targeted device.",
    "required_capabilities": "An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker is required, meaning the attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent)."
