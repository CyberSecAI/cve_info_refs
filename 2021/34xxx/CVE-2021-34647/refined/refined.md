Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2021-34647:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an insufficient permission check on the REST API endpoints `/ninja-forms-submissions/export` and `/ninja-forms-submissions/email-action`. The plugin only checks if a user is logged in (`is_user_logged_in()`), but does not verify if the user has the necessary capabilities/permissions to access these functionalities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The `/ninja-forms-submissions/export` endpoint allows any authenticated user to export all form submission data. This data can contain sensitive PII.
2.  **Improper Access Control:** The `/ninja-forms-submissions/email-action` endpoint allows any authenticated user to trigger email actions. This includes crafting the email subject, body, and recipient, which is derived from the request.
3.  **Email Injection:** An attacker could exploit the `/ninja-forms-submissions/email-action` to send arbitrary emails from the vulnerable website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive data (PII) from form submissions via the export functionality.
*   **Phishing Attacks:** The ability to send arbitrary emails from a legitimate domain can be used for phishing attacks.
*   **Spear Phishing:** Targeted attacks could be conducted, making it appear as if the site owner sent an email from their own site, leading to potential further compromise.
*   **Site Takeover (Potential):** Email injection can lead to further attacks, for instance social engineering to gain access to the site by luring administrators to fake login pages.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerabilities are accessible via the WordPress REST API.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a logged-in user on the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   No special capabilities or administrative privileges are required beyond being a basic authenticated user.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Wordfence article provides a more detailed description of the vulnerabilities than the provided CVE description.
*   The vulnerability was patched in Ninja Forms version 3.5.8.
*   The vulnerable code is within the `NF_Routes_Submissions` class, specifically within the `permission_callback`, `bulk_export_submissions`, and `trigger_email_action` functions.
*   The plugin uses `apply_filters('ninja_forms_api_allow_email_action', $allowed, $request)` which provides a way to modify the permissions but was not properly implemented by the plugin by default.
*   The `bulk_export_submissions` function used to generate CSV exports retrieved data from request body (`$request->get_body()`) or `$_GET` parameters, without sanitization/validation.
*   The `trigger_email_action` used the `process_merge_tags` function to replace merge tags with values extracted from the form submission.
