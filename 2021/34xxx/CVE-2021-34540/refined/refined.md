    "content": "Root cause:\n\nThe root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization when displaying usernames in the 'Dashboard Viewer' feature of Advantech WebAccess.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nThe primary weakness is the absence of proper input sanitization, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code. When a user interacts with the affected page, the malicious script is executed, potentially enabling the attacker to perform actions such as:\n\n*   Stealing session cookies or other sensitive data.\n*   Redirecting users to malicious websites.\n*   Modifying displayed content.\n\nAttack vectors:\n\nThe attack vector involves injecting a malicious JavaScript payload into the username field within the 'Dashboard Viewer' feature.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n\nAn attacker needs the ability to modify the username field and submit the form. This likely requires authenticated access to the Advantech WebAccess application."
