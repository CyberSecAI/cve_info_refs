- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from unprotected data export, specifically concerning backup functionality. The random key used for protection is reset to empty after a reboot.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Direct Request (Forced Browsing) (CWE-425). The backup export is protected by a random key that is set at user login but becomes empty after a reboot.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially access sensitive data by exploiting the unprotected backup export mechanism. While the impact is confidentiality, there is no Integrity or availability impact.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack. An attacker could exploit this over the network without authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication is required. The attacker can access the vulnerable functionality over the network.
