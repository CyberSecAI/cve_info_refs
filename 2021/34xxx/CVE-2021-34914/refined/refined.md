Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-34914:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the parsing of DGN files in Bentley View and MicroStation.
- Specifically, crafted data in a DGN file can trigger a write past the end of an allocated buffer (out-of-bounds write).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds write vulnerability

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute code on the target machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted DGN files.
- Requires user interaction, such as opening the malicious DGN file using an affected version of Bentley software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious DGN file.
- The attacker must get the victim to open the file using a vulnerable version of Bentley software.
- The attack can be performed locally (AV:L), and no special privileges are needed (PR:N), but user interaction (UI:R) is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
- Bentley has released updates to address this vulnerability, with version 10.16.02.* and later being mitigated versions.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.8, with a vector of AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
