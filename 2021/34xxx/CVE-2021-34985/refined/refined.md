Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-34985:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the improper parsing of OBJ files within Bentley ContextCapture Viewer.
*   Specifically, the software fails to properly validate user-supplied data when parsing these files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The lack of proper validation allows a crafted OBJ file to cause a read operation beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially disclose sensitive information by triggering the out-of-bounds read.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By combining this vulnerability with other vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious OBJ File:** An attacker can craft a malicious OBJ file that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, as the target must either visit a malicious webpage or open the malicious OBJ file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to create a malicious OBJ file.
*   The attacker must induce the user to open the file via malicious page or directly.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) program.
*   The vulnerability is tracked as ZDI-CAN-14785.
*   Bentley has released a patched version of ContextCapture Viewer (>=10.19.0.580) to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 3.3, indicating a low severity.
*   The specific flaw occurs during the parsing process of the .obj file where a read occurs past the end of an allocated buffer.
*   The advisory notes that only opening OBJ files from a trusted source and updating to the latest version are mitigations for the vulnerability.
