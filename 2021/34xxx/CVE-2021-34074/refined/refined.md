Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1: File Upload Vulnerability (CVE-2021-34074)**

*   **Root Cause:** The file manager in Pandora FMS allows the creation of directories using relative paths. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended directory structure and upload files outside of the designated image directory.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate directory names, allowing relative paths (e.g., `../K44`).
    *   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows the upload of PHP files.
    *   **Executable File Upload:** The uploaded files are not blocked from being executed by the server.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **File Manager:** The vulnerability is located within the file manager feature.
    *   **HTTP Requests:** The attack involves crafting HTTP POST requests with specific parameters to create directories using relative paths and then upload a malicious PHP file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the file manager.

**Vulnerability 2: Stored XSS (CVE-2021-35501)**

*   **Root Cause:** The Visual Console feature does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly encode or sanitize user input in the Visual Console, allowing the injection of JavaScript code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the compromised visual console. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or further exploitation.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Visual Console:** The vulnerability is present within the Visual Console feature.
    *   **XSS Payload:** The attacker inserts malicious JavaScript code when creating or editing a visual console.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a low-privileged authenticated user that can create a Visual Console

**Chained Exploit**

*   **Description:** The attacker chains the Stored XSS and File Upload vulnerability to achieve RCE. A low-privilege user injects malicious JavaScript into a visual console using the stored XSS. When an administrator views the visual console, the injected JavaScript executes. This script leverages the file upload vulnerability to upload and execute a PHP file containing a reverse shell, giving the attacker complete control of the system.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *  **Combined XSS and File Upload**: The attacker uses the XSS vulnerability to deliver the attack and leverages the File Upload vulnerability as the final step of their exploit.
*   **Required Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a low-privileged authenticated user.
    *   The attacker needs access to create visual consoles.
    *   The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious javascript.
    *   An admin needs to view the visual console with the XSS payload for the exploit to trigger.

**Summary of CVEs**

*   **CVE-2021-34074:** File Upload vulnerability due to path traversal and lack of file validation, leading to RCE.
*  **CVE-2021-35501:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting in Visual Console.
