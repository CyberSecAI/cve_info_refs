- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Kaden PICOFLUX AiR water meter uses a shared or derived encryption key for Wireless M-Bus Security mode 5, and this key is not unique or configurable for each device. The key is either hardcoded, derived from the meter number or other publicly available parameters, and is not provided to the end user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Hardcoded/predictable cryptographic key (CWE-798).
    - Lack of key management for encryption.
    - Use of a shared secret for all devices or a secret derived from public information.
    - Insecure implementation of Wireless M-Bus Security mode 5.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can passively eavesdrop on the wireless communication and read the water consumption data, potentially leading to privacy violations, activity pattern analysis, and detection of vacant properties.
- **Attack vectors**: Wireless communication interception within the vicinity of the meters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be within range of the meter's wireless signal and possess a compatible reader, such as the KADEN ZET810s, and knowledge of the shared/derived encryption key.
