- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data within the Cookie HTTP header before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attacker sends a crafted HTTP request with an overly long Cookie header to the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network-adjacent access to the vulnerable D-Link DAP-1330 router. No authentication is required.
