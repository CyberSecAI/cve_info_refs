- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The stack cookie was not randomized in all trusted applications (TAs).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of stack cookie randomization. This can lead to stack-based buffer overflows.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Denial of service, escalation of privileges, and information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  Attacker needs local access with high privileges and must induce user interaction.
