- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of the cloud certificate chain in the Command Centre Mobile Client for Android.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper validation of the cloud certificate chain, allowing a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can impersonate a legitimate Command Centre Server. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and manipulation of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be positioned in the network path between the mobile client and the Command Centre server to perform the MitM attack and impersonate the server.
