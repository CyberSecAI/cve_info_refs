- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An error in the URL handler of the web-based interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can send a crafted link to a user, which will execute JavaScript code in the context of the user. This could lead to the attacker gaining control of the user's session or performing actions on their behalf.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to send a crafted link to a user of the web-based interface. The attacker also needs to have knowledge of the camera's address.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have knowledge of the camera's address and be able to craft a malicious link. The attacker requires the victim to click on the malicious link, which requires user interaction (UI:R).
