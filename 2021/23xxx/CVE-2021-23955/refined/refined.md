Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Firefox handles pointer lock requests, specifically when the request is not initiated within a short-running user-generated event handler.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Incorrect Pointer Lock State Management:** Firefox fails to properly deny or cancel a pointer lock request when the initiating page loses focus or the request fails. This results in the browser continuing to send mouse events to the tab that initially requested the pointer lock, even when a different tab is active, leading to a clickjacking scenario.
-   **Lack of proper communication:** The content process that requests the pointer lock doesn't inform the parent process when the request is denied, leading to the parent process incorrectly redirecting mouse events.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Clickjacking:** An attacker can trick users into interacting with elements of a website without their knowledge, such as clicking on buttons or links, while a different, malicious page is displayed on top. This can be used to steal information, perform unwanted actions (like starring a repo on github as demonstrated in the attached video), or spread malware.
-   **Cross-Tab Clickjacking:** This vulnerability allows clickjacking across different tabs, making it more severe than simple clickjacking within the same page.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious Website:** The attacker hosts a webpage that requests pointer lock using JavaScript. This page doesn't need to be the target; it just needs to be opened in the same tab session.
-   **User Interaction:** The user is tricked into interacting with the malicious webpage, causing it to request pointer lock.
-   **Tab Misdirection:** If the pointer lock request isn't correctly handled, then any subsequent clicks on the user's active tab will be interpreted by the initial malicious page in another tab.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to host a website with malicious javascript that makes a pointer lock request.
-   The attacker needs to trick the user into opening their malicious page in a browser (using a Firefox version with the vulnerability)
-   The attacker is required to make the user interact with the malicious website to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker does not need any specific privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim.

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability is a regression introduced in Firefox 83.
-   The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 85.
- The issue was found by an external reporter
- A patch was made to adjust the pointer lock request handling, that did not introduce significant code changes, making it a low risk fix.
- The fix was verified by QA

This is a high severity security vulnerability due to the potential for clickjacking across tabs.
