Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23385:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from inconsistent URL parsing, specifically how different WSGI servers and the `Werkzeug` library handle multiple backslashes in URLs. The `flask-security` package uses `get_post_logout_redirect` and `get_post_login_redirect` functions, which are vulnerable to open redirect if an attacker provides a URL with multiple backslashes, such as `\\\evil.com/path`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Open Redirect:** The application redirects users to a URL that is derived from user input without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to control the redirect destination.
*   **URL Parsing Inconsistency:** Different URL parsers interpret the same URL differently, leading to bypasses in URL validation. Some parsers might normalize the URL by removing or converting backslashes, while others will interpret multiple slashes or backslashes in a way that allows bypassing redirect restrictions.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate URLs, especially those containing multiple backslashes before performing redirects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites that mimic legitimate login pages, stealing credentials or other sensitive information.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Redirects can lead to the download of malware or other harmful software.
*   **Reputation Damage:** A successful exploit can damage the reputation of the vulnerable application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.
*   **Manipulated URLs:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing multiple backslashes (e.g., `\\\evil.com/path`) and includes this within a `return_to` parameter within an HTTP request.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires a user to click on the crafted link, triggering the vulnerable redirect.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable application server.
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a specific URL that includes the malicious redirect path with multiple backslashes.
*   **User Lure:** The attacker needs to entice a user to click the malicious link.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when the `autocorrect_location_header` option in Werkzeug is set to `False` or when using an alternative WSGI server that does not perform URL normalization.
*   The `flask-security` package is no longer maintained.

The provided content also mentions the related CVE-2021-32618, which affects `flask-security-too` package and has a similar root cause. Both vulnerabilities are examples of "URL confusion" issues resulting from differences in how various URL parsers handle non-standard URL formatting.
