- The application becomes inaccessible to legitimate users.
- Complete loss of availability of resources managed by `mongo-express`.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability can be triggered remotely over the network. The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends to the entire internet.
- An attacker sends a crafted request to export an empty collection as CSV.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs network access to the `mongo-express` application.
- The attacker requires administrative privileges to perform actions within the component, allowing access to component-wide settings and files.
- No user interaction is needed.
