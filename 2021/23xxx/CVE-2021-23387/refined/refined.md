Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23387:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the `trailing-slash` package handles redirects. Specifically, when a URL containing double slashes (e.g., `https://example.com//attacker.example/`) is encountered, the package uses relative URLs instead of absolute URLs, leading to an open redirect vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Open Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is an open redirect. The application redirects the user to a URL controlled by the attacker when provided with a crafted URL.
*   **Improper URL Handling:** The core issue is the use of relative URLs in the redirection logic within the `index.js::createTrailing()` function. Specifically, the vulnerable code does not properly handle the double forward slashes in the input URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** An attacker can craft a URL with double slashes that redirects users to a malicious website. This can be used for phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can send the crafted URL to a vulnerable server over the network. The attacker does not need any special access to the target system besides the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No special privileges:** The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the target system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker simply needs to be able to send a network request to the server with the crafted URL.
*   **User Interaction**: The vulnerability requires user interaction, i.e. a user needs to click on a malicious link for the exploit to be successful.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Versions of the `trailing-slash` package prior to 2.0.1 are vulnerable.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.0.1 by escaping the leading slashes via the `escapeLeadingSlashes` function within `index.js` before the redirect.
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided PoC demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by appending `//example.com` to the endpoint.
*   **CWE:** The vulnerability is associated with CWE-601 (URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')).
