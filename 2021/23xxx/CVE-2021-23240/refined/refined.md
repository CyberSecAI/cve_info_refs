An unprivileged user could create a temporary file in `/var/tmp`, remove it, and replace it with a symlink to another file. The `chown()` call would then change the ownership of the symlink target instead of the intended temporary file.",

     "summary": "The provided content confirms that CVE-2021-23240 is related to a symlink attack vulnerability in `sudoedit` within an SELinux context, specifically regarding how the `chown()` system call follows symlinks when creating or copying temporary files. The vulnerability is exploitable when SELinux is in permissive mode, where the intended protection is not enforced, allowing an unprivileged user to manipulate symlinks and potentially modify the ownership of arbitrary files.  Some sources also mention a more general privilege escalation issue, and the vulnerability has a high severity score (7.8)."
