{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `go-proxyproto` library did not implement a timeout when waiting for the PROXY protocol header. This allowed malicious clients to open connections without sending the header, causing the server to hold those connections indefinitely, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Denial of Service (DoS)",
      "Resource exhaustion",
        "Lack of timeout on socket reads"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious client could open numerous connections without sending the PROXY protocol header, causing the server to hold these connections open indefinitely, eventually leading to resource exhaustion and a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network connections",
      "Malicious clients not sending the proxy header"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to establish TCP connections to the server. No other specific capabilities are required.",
    "additional_details": "The fix introduces a `ReadHeaderTimeout` to the listener, allowing to set a deadline for how long to wait for the PROXY header. The initial fix had a regression, where the read deadline was not reset after parsing the header, leading to issues. This was fixed in a later release."
