---

### Severity

 Recommended 0.0critical010

CVSS assessment made by Snyk's Security Team. [Learn more](/vuln/SNYK-JS-LAUNCHPAD-1044065#cvss)

### Threat Intelligence

EPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.
Check out the EPSS
[documentation](https://www.first.org/epss/articles/prob_percentile_bins)
for more details.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

9.8 critical

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**

### ⚙️ Description \*

The issue arised in multiple locations, so I to validate the type of data the functions were going to use (like the `paths`) and since there were some `multi commands` I didn't use the `execFile` function, which should have had stored many new variables because we wouldn't have been to concatenate and return results that would have been used in a second/third command correlated to the first one executed. In this case I simply made a functionality that `deletes every quote` from the variable, making impossible threat the `variables concatenated` as commands, but only as `arguments` of the specific command.

### 💻 Technical Description \*

The fix has been applied in 3 different ways inside 3 different files, so I'll comment each one.

1. The issue arises firstly here: <https://github.com/bitovi/launchpad/blob/master/lib/local/instance.js#L12> because of the fact the `name` variable is `concatenated` inside the various commands without being sanitized. Since the `name` is inside some `single-quotes` it would have been useless split the 3 different commands inside 3 different `execFile` that would have used more resources to store the content of the singular commands that should be concatenated again ... instead I introduced the `safe` function which deletes the `quotes` from the `name` in order to make it to be only an argument not escapable from quotes.

```
var safe = function (str) {
   // Avoid quotes makes impossible escape the `multi command` scenario
   return str.replace(/['"]+/g, '');
}
```

Note I've used the `execFile` function later in this file in the following lines: <https://github.com/Mik317/launchpad/blob/master/lib/local/instance.js#L104> and <https://github.com/Mik317/launchpad/blob/master/lib/local/instance.js#L110>, in order to avoid `commands` could be executed in a dangerous context.

2. The 2' issue arised inside the following line: <https://github.com/bitovi/launchpad/blob/master/lib/local/version.js#L21>

In this case it I used `execFile` in order to avoid concatenation of other strings containing dangerous characters.

Patched with:

```
    exec(command.split(' ')[0], command.split(' ').slice(1), function(error, stdout) {
```

In this case the first part of the `command` is taken as `command to execute` (surely a path since the `command` variable is made through

```
    var command = path.join('"' + __dirname, '..', '..', 'resources', 'ShowVer.exe" "' + browser.command + '"');
```

), while the second part are the `arguments`.

3. The last issue arised here: <https://github.com/bitovi/launchpad/blob/master/lib/local/version.js#L50>

   In this case the `browser path and filename` weren't checked completely, and even if the execution of malicious code would have been possible only if the `default browser` of the victim has a badly crafted `filename`, I inserted a check to see if the `path+filename` pointing to the browser is a valid `path`.

   The issue has been fixed through this function:

```
// Validate paths supplied by the user in order to avoid "arbitrary command execution"
var validPath = function (filename){
  var filter = /[`!@#$%^&*()_+\-=\[\]{};':"\\|,<>\/?~]/;
  if (filter.test(filename)){
    console.log('\nInvalid characters inside the path to the browser\n');
    return
  }
  return filename;
}
```
### 🐛 Proof of Concept (PoC) \*

1. Download the JS library (launchpad)
2. Go inside the path you downloaded it and make the following `poc.js` file:

```
// poc.js
var launchpad = require("./launchpad/lib/local/instance");
var tst = new launchpad.Instance('t', {}, {}, {process:"s'; touch HACKED; # "});
tst.getPid(function(){});
```

3. Execute through `node poc.js`
4. The `HACKED` file will we created

### 🔥 Proof of Fix (PoF) \*

1. Download the fixed version
2. Use the same POC previously indexed
3. The `HACKED` file is NOT created anymore

   [![Screenshot from 2020-06-26 19-52-10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33063403/85889359-98faeb00-b7eb-11ea-924b-7dc4b416753e.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33063403/85889359-98faeb00-b7eb-11ea-924b-7dc4b416753e.png)

### 👍 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

It doesn't introduce any error (at least using the module through the PoC I crafted)

Regards,

Mik

| After this PR, the browsers do not exit as expected during the test suite. Prior to the PR during the test battery browsers would exit. I don't know the source of the issue yet but am investigating. [@JamieSlome](https://github.com/JamieSlome) and [@Mik317](https://github.com/Mik317) I would appreciate your help on this. |

| Root cause: Because execFile does not create a subshell, quoting does not work the same way when constructing the command to terminate a process: Not working: `execFile('osascript', ['-e', '\'tell', 'application', '"Opera"', 'to', 'quit\'']); // this is the result of splitting the original line on spaces`  Also not working: `execFile('osascript', ['-e', ''tell application' "Opera"' to quit'']);  In each of these cases, the single quote at the beginning and end of the AppleScript snippet is passed to the script interpreter as a literal quote, and it is not accepted. (The error returned is `Syntax Error: A unknown token can’t go here`)  Working: `execFile('osascript', ['-e', 'tell application "Opera" to quit']`  I have made a PR to address this. No further action is required. Thanks for the security fix! |
