- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `set-deep-prop` package is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to its unsafe handling of property paths when setting values on a deeply nested object or array.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the ability of an attacker to control the "path" argument and set it to `__proto__.myValue`, which allows injecting properties into the prototype of the base object, leading to prototype pollution.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Denial of Service (DoS): By polluting properties like `toString` or `valueOf` on `Object.prototype`, attackers can cause JavaScript exceptions and denial of service.
    - Remote Code Execution: If the codebase evaluates a specific polluted attribute (e.g., using `eval`), an attacker can achieve remote code execution.
    - Property Injection: Attackers can inject or manipulate existing properties used for security or informational purposes (e.g., `isAdmin` for admin privileges).
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a crafted "path" argument that includes `__proto__` when using the `setDeepProp` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to control the "path" parameter passed to the `setDeepProp` function. No special privileges or user interaction is required.
