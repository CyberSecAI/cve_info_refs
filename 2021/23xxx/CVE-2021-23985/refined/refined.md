Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-23985

**Root Cause:**
The DevTools remote debugging feature could be enabled without any visual indication to the user when certain `about:config` values were modified, specifically `devtools.debugger.prompt-connection` set to `false` and `remote-enabled` set to `true`. This configuration would allow remote connections to the browser without user awareness.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of visual cue when DevTools remote debugging is enabled. This allowed malicious actors to remotely connect and monitor browsing activity without the user's knowledge.
- The configuration setting `devtools.debugger.prompt-connection` being set to `false`, which is primarily for automated testing, could also be exploited by malicious actors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Monitoring of browsing activity:** A remote attacker could monitor the user's browsing activity.
- **Plaintext network traffic capture:** A remote attacker could intercept and view plaintext network traffic.
- **Potential Information Disclosure:** Information transmitted over the network could be exposed to the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malware:** An attacker could use malware running on the user's computer to modify the `about:config` values.
- **Remote Connection:** Once the settings were altered, a remote attacker could connect to the browser over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to modify `about:config` values:** The attacker needs to be able to change Firefox settings on the user's machine, typically through malware.
- **Direct network connection:**  The attacker needs to be able to make a direct network connection to the victim's browser once the remote debugging is enabled.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by introducing a visual cue in the URL bar when DevTools has an open network socket, providing a clear indication to the user that remote debugging is enabled.
- The fix was implemented by reusing the same visual cue (robot head icon) used by Marionette/Puppeteer, which was already triggered by a `remote-listening` observer notification.
- The initial report came from ZDI (Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative) who stated that this had been abused in the wild by malware.
- The bug report mentions the possibility of locking preferences but was deferred to a follow-up. The fix implemented is primarily the visual cue to notify the user when remote debugging is enabled.
