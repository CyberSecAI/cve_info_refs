Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-23858:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an unprotected web server resource that exposes sensitive information without requiring authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The web server exposes the main configuration, including user accounts and their hashed passwords, through an unprotected resource.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Device details like serial numbers and firmware versions are also exposed via another unprotected web server resource.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information, including user credentials (hashed passwords) and device details.
*   Combined with CVE-2021-23857, this vulnerability allows an attacker to log in to the system.
*   The attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the control system and manipulate it.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based.
*   The attacker can access the vulnerable resource remotely via the web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have network access to the affected device's web server.
*   No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Summary of CVE-2021-23858:**
This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to retrieve sensitive data, including user credentials (hashed passwords), serial numbers, and firmware versions, due to the lack of protection of specific web server resources. This can be combined with another vulnerability (CVE-2021-23857) to gain complete access to the system.
