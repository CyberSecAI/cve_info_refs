Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23177:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an improper link resolution flaw in libarchive when extracting an archive. Specifically, when extracting a symbolic link with defined Access Control Lists (ACLs) on Linux, the ACLs of the link target are modified instead of the link itself. This occurs because the `acl_set_file()` function was used without first verifying if the target is a symbolic link.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of symbolic links during archive extraction.
- Usage of `acl_set_file()` on symbolic links on Linux, which results in modifying the ACL of the target rather than the symlink.
- Lack of a check to differentiate symbolic links from regular files before setting ACLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local attacker can provide a malicious archive to a victim user. When the user extracts the archive, the attacker can potentially change the ACLs of arbitrary files on the system through symbolic links, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
- This improper ACL modification on the target of a symlink can lead to unauthorized access to files or other resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local attacker crafts a malicious archive containing a symbolic link with specific ACL settings.
- The victim user extracts the archive.
- During the extraction, libarchive incorrectly applies ACLs to the symlink target, allowing the attacker to modify its permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the victim's system.
- Ability to create and provide a malicious archive file to the victim.
- No specific privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability, though the ability to write files to the filesystem is required.
- The victim is required to extract the archive.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The issue was fixed in libarchive version 3.5.2.
- The vulnerability affects Linux systems due to how ACLs are handled with symlinks, unlike FreeBSD and macOS, which use `acl_set_link_np()` that avoids the vulnerability.
- Red Hat assigned CVE-2021-23177 to this vulnerability, and provided a fix in their RHSA-2022:0892 advisory, which includes the changes described in the upstream fix.
- Debian also addressed this vulnerability in their DLA-3202-1 advisory.
- The commit `fba4f123cc456d2b2538f811bb831483bf336bad` from libarchive on GitHub contains the fix.

In summary, CVE-2021-23177 is a vulnerability in libarchive where a specially crafted archive could lead to local privilege escalation by modifying ACLs of files via symbolic links. The vulnerability is triggered when a user extracts an archive, and an attacker can exploit this with a crafted archive.
