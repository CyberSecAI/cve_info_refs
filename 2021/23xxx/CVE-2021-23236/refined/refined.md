The provided document contains information about multiple vulnerabilities affecting the Fresenius Kabi Agilia Connect Infusion System. CVE-2021-23236 is specifically related to **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** in Agilia Link+.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the device's susceptibility to requests that can interrupt its normal operation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400). Specifically, requests can be used to interrupt the normal operation of the Agilia Link+ device.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation results in the device becoming unresponsive, requiring a hard reboot via a button on the rack system. This leads to a denial of service (DoS).
- The document states that the infusion pump alarm is not affected, infusion parameters are preserved, current infusion is not interrupted and no unacceptable patient risk is identified. It also maintains no risk of exposure to PII or PHI.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote network-based attacks by sending malicious requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the device is required. The attacker doesn't need prior authentication (PR:N) and the attack has a low complexity.

**Additional Details:**
- The CVSS v3 base score is 7.5, with a vector string of AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. This indicates that the attack vector is network-based, the attack complexity is low, no privileges are required, there is no user interaction needed, and the impact is a high level of availability loss.
