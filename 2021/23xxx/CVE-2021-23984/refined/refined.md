Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information regarding CVE-2021-23984:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability was caused by an incorrect reference in `tabbrowser.js` where `Services.uriFixup.createExposableURI` was used instead of `Services.io.createExposableURI`. This occurred in the `getWindowTitleForBrowser` function, which is responsible for setting the title of browser windows. The relevant code is wrapped in a try-catch block that ignores errors.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The vulnerability allowed a malicious extension to fully control the title of a popup window lacking an address bar.
- Due to the incorrect reference, the browser was not prepending the extension's name or URL to the title, which should have happened. This made it impossible for the user to distinguish a legitimate popup from one controlled by a malicious extension.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious extension could spoof the title of a popup window, potentially tricking users into believing it was a legitimate website.
- This could lead to credential theft, as users might enter sensitive information into the spoofed popup.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a malicious browser extension.
- The extension must be able to open popup windows without an address bar to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a malicious extension installed on the user's browser.
- The attacker needs to be able to create a popup window through the extension's API.
