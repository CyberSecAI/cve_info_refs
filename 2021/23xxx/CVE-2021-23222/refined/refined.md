Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23222:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the `libpq` library (PostgreSQL client library) handles data received during the establishment of an encrypted connection using SSL or GSSAPI. The library would buffer additional data after receiving the server's initial response to an encryption request. This buffered data, which was not encrypted, would be processed as if it was already decrypted, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious data into the session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unencrypted Data Handling:** The `libpq` library does not properly validate or discard extra data received alongside the server's SSL/GSSAPI handshake confirmation, treating it as decrypted data.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Vulnerability:** An attacker positioned between the client and server can exploit this flaw to inject their own data into the connection stream before encryption is fully established.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Injection of False Responses:** A man-in-the-middle attacker can inject false responses to the client's initial queries, potentially leading to unexpected or malicious behavior.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker can potentially extract sensitive data like passwords or other confidential information transmitted early in the connection. The attacker needs to trick the server into making the confidential data accessible and have a way to retrieve it later

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Man-in-the-Middle:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between a PostgreSQL client and server, injecting unencrypted data during the encryption handshake process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle Position:** The attacker must be able to intercept and modify network traffic between a PostgreSQL client and server.
*   **Data Injection:** The attacker must inject unencrypted bytes into the TCP connection during the encryption handshake.
*   For password disclosure, the attacker needs some way to trick the server into making confidential data accessible and must have access to retrieve it

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity by both Red Hat and PostgreSQL
*   The vulnerability was reported by Jacob Champion.
*   The fix involves rejecting connections if extraneous data exists in the internal buffer after the encryption handshake has completed.
*   This CVE is related to, and can be combined with exploitation of CVE-2021-23214
*   Red Hat rated the impact of this as "Low" in their security advisory RHSA-2022:1891.
