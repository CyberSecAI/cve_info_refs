Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23203:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a programming error in the report engine of Odoo, where access control settings were not properly applied. This allowed users to bypass intended restrictions and access reports for documents they were not authorized to view.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Access Control:** The core issue is the failure to enforce access control mechanisms in the reporting engine, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive documents.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** Although not explicitly stated, the vulnerability implies an IDOR where an attacker can manipulate request parameters to access reports of different document IDs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive information contained within PDF reports of arbitrary documents. This includes business records, financial data, personal information, etc., depending on the specific reports and data stored in Odoo.
-  **No Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability did not allow privilege escalation but could expose confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Exploitable:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
- **Crafted Requests:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests to the Odoo server to download PDF reports for unauthorized documents.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **No User Account required (Not always):** An attacker may or may not need a user account on the Odoo system. If a user account is present, it does not need to have admin privileges or be related to the document of the report.
- **Knowledge of Target System:** An attacker needs to have some knowledge of the target system to create crafted requests. This may include some idea of the document IDs, report types etc., but this is not explicitly stated.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Versions:** Odoo Community and Enterprise Editions from version 14.0 up to 15.0.
- **CVSS Score:** High, with a score of 7.5.
- **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
- **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is resolved by updating to the latest version of Odoo or applying the specific patches provided by the developers.
- The vulnerability is present in the reporting engine of the Odoo software.
- Odoo Cloud servers were patched as soon as the correction was available.
