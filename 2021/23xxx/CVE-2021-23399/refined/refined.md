**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Arbitrary command injection vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization when using the `child_process.exec` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system by injecting malicious input into the `getCredential` function.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `getCredential` function of the `wincred` package by providing malicious user input.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to control the user input that is passed to the `getCredential` function.
- No prior privileges are required. The attacker can be remote, as this is a network based vulnerability.
