Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23447:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a type confusion issue in how the `teddy` templating library handles model content. When the model content is an array, the library fails to properly sanitize it, leading to a bypass of input sanitization mechanisms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The core vulnerability is XSS. Specifically, the lack of proper sanitization allows injection of malicious scripts into the rendered output.
- **Type Confusion:** The application incorrectly handles array types as input, instead of string types, which results in bypassing the escaping mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into web pages rendered using the vulnerable `teddy` library.
- This injected code can be executed within the victim's browser.
- Potential impacts include stealing cookies, hijacking user sessions, exposing sensitive information, enabling access to privileged services, and delivering malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through manipulating the input that is provided to the `teddy` templating engine. Specifically, by providing an array that bypasses the input validation and sanitization logic when processing the template.
- A crafted template and model content, where the model content intended to be escaped is provided as an array, instead of a string

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to control the input data being passed to the `teddy` render function.
- They need to be able to supply a template and model content containing malicious script, and be able to pass an array as content where a string was expected.
- The attacker does not require any prior privileges.
- The user is required to interact with the malicious content by visiting a web page.

**Additional Information from Content:**
- **Affected Versions:** Versions of the `teddy` package prior to 0.5.9 are vulnerable.
- **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.5.9 and later, which introduces proper sanitization for array inputs.
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided PoC demonstrates how passing a string to `render` correctly escapes characters, but passing an array does not.
- **CVSS Score:** The Snyk score for this vulnerability is 5.4 (Medium), while NVD score is 6.1 (Medium).
- **Snyk references** a blog post that further details the vulnerability "Remediate Javascript type confusion bypassed input validation"

**Summary**

The identified vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `teddy` library, caused by improper handling of array types in the model content. This can be exploited by attackers by injecting malicious scripts and code into web applications that use this templating engine. The vulnerability has a medium severity rating, and is addressed in version 0.5.9 of the package.
