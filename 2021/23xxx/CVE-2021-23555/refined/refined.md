Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23555:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the ability to directly access host error objects generated by Node.js internals when creating stack traces within the `vm2` sandbox. This allows the attacker to access and manipulate the prototype chain of these error objects, leading to sandbox escape.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sandbox Bypass:** The core issue is that the `vm2` sandbox fails to properly isolate the error objects generated by the Node.js runtime.
- **Prototype Pollution:** By manipulating the prototype chain of error objects, an attacker can pollute the host environment's prototypes.
- **Direct Access to Host Objects:** The vulnerability stems from the sandboxed environmentâ€™s ability to access host objects (specifically error objects with stack traces).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the host machine.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Due to the nature of the exploit, successful exploitation could lead to a total loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the execution of untrusted JavaScript code within the `vm2` sandbox.
- The vulnerability is triggered by actions within the sandboxed environment that cause error stack traces to be generated, thus exposing the host's error objects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to execute JavaScript code within the `vm2` sandbox:** An attacker needs the ability to run code within the sandboxed environment to exploit this vulnerability.
- **No Prior Authorization:** The attacker does not need any prior authorization or access to the host machine.

**Additional details:**
- **Proof of concept** The provided PoCs (PoC 1 and PoC 2) demonstrate how to achieve sandbox bypass by polluting the prototype chain via error objects.
- **CVSS Score:** Snyk and NVD both rate the severity of this vulnerability as critical with a score of 9.8.
- **Affected versions:** Versions of `vm2` prior to 3.9.6 are vulnerable.
- **Fix:** Upgrading to version 3.9.6 or higher resolves the vulnerability.
- **CWE:** The vulnerability is associated with CWE-1321 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes) and CWE-265 (Missing Support for the Use of Multiple Code Segments).
