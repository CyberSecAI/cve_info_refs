### Threat Intelligence

Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof of conceptEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

[CVE-2021-23331  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-23331) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-377  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/377.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `com.squareup:connect`.

## Overview

[com.squareup:connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect) is a stack of middleware that is executed in order in each request.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Temporary File. The method `prepareDownloadFilecreates` creates a temporary file with the permissions bits of `-rw-r--r--` on unix-like systems. On unix-like systems, the system temporary directory is shared between users. As such, the contents of the file downloaded by `downloadFileFromResponse` will be visible to all other users on the local system.

A workaround fix for this issue is to set the system property `java.io.tmpdir` to a `safe` directory as remediation.

Note: This version of the SDK is end of life and no longer maintained, please upgrade to the latest version.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

4.4 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker's path is via read/write/execute capabilities.

  **Local**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker requires privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges has the ability to access only non-sensitive resources.

  **Low**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**
