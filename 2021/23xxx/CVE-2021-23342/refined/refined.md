Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-23342:

**Root Cause:**
- Incomplete fix for CVE-2020-7680. The primary issue is that while HTML sanitization was implemented for the main page content fetched from remote URLs, the same sanitization was not applied to the sidebar content. Additionally, the `isURL` check could be bypassed using multiple forward slashes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of sanitization in the sidebar allows injection of arbitrary HTML code which can lead to execution of malicious Javascript.
- **Inadequate URL validation:** The `isURL` check could be bypassed, allowing for the loading of arbitrary remote content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a user's browser. This can potentially lead to:
    - Stealing cookies and hijacking user sessions.
    - Exposing sensitive information.
    - Gaining access to privileged services and functionality.
    - Delivering malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when `docsify` parses HTML from remote URLs and renders it in the sidebar.
- The attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when loaded, injects malicious code into the user's browser.
- The `isURL` check can be bypassed by adding more than two forward slashes at the beginning of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to get a user to visit a malicious link. This can be done through methods like social engineering, by hosting a page with the malicious link.
- No special privileges or access is required to carry out the attack.
- The attack can be performed remotely over a network.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in `docsify` versions 4.11.6 and prior.
- The fix involves sanitizing the sidebar content fetched from remote URLs and patching the `isURL` check in version 4.12.1.
- The PoC provided involves setting up a webserver that serves a HTML page with Javascript, which is then loaded into `docsify` via a manipulated URL.
- The fix for the `isURL` bypass was implemented in commit `ff2a66f12752471277fe81a64ad6c4b2c08111fe`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as a DOM-based XSS, which means that the malicious code is executed within the user's browser, rather than being reflected from the server.
- The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction after they are directed to the malicious page.
- CVSS v3.1 score of 8.6 (High) was assigned by Snyk.
