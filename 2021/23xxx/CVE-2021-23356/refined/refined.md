- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `kill-process-by-name` package uses the `child_process.exec` function without sanitizing user-provided input, leading to arbitrary command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system where the vulnerable package is used.
- **Attack vectors:** By providing malicious input as a process name to the `kill-process-by-name` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the input that is passed to the `kill-process-by-name` function.
