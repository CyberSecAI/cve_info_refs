Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23405:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input sanitization on the `storeId` parameter within the `collectionsActionGet` and `groupsActionGet` methods of the `ClassificationstoreController` class in pimcore.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`storeId` parameter) before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not check or validate the content of the `storeId` parameter before using it in a SQL query, making it susceptible to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, potentially including usernames, passwords, and other sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Integrity Violation:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- **Availability Issues:** An attacker could potentially use the vulnerability to disrupt the normal operation of the application through actions like sleep commands or denial-of-service attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted HTTP GET requests to the `/admin/classificationstore/groups` and `/admin/classificationstore/collections` endpoints.
- **`storeId` Parameter:** The malicious SQL injection payloads are inserted into the `storeId` parameter of the GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application, making this a remotely exploitable vulnerability.
- **Basic understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker must be able to craft SQL queries to extract or manipulate data from the database.
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability with low privileges, as the application does not require a higher level of access to be vulnerable.
