Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2021-23201:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies within an internal microcontroller in NVIDIA GPUs and Tegra hardware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The vulnerability allows a user with elevated privileges to generate valid microcode by identifying, exploiting, and loading vulnerable microcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to:
*   Information disclosure
*   Data corruption
*   Denial of service (DoS) of the device
*   The scope of impact may extend to other components.

**Attack Vectors:**
Local access is required

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker requires OS administrative/kernel rights.
*   The attacker needs to identify, exploit, and load vulnerable microcode.

**Affected Products**
*   Turing, Volta, Pascal, Maxwell, Tegra X1, Tegra X1+, Tegra TX2, and Xavier products are affected.
*   Ampere products are not impacted.
*   In an environment where the GPU is virtualized (e.g., vGPU), you are not impacted.
*   If the hypervisor is compromised or you have direct GPU access with bare metal or pass-through, Turing, Volta, Pascal, or Maxwell products can be exposed.
