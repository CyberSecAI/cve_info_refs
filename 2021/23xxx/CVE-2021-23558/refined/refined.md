Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-23558:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization within the `set` function of the `bmoor` library. The library failed to properly handle array inputs when setting object properties, leading to a bypass of the intended security checks and ultimately, prototype pollution.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Type Confusion:** The library used strict equality checks (`===`) that could be bypassed by providing an array containing the string `__proto__` or `constructor`. The comparison `currentPath === '__proto__'` returns `false` when `currentPath` is `['__proto__']` due to the type mismatch.
    *   **Prototype Pollution:** This type confusion allows an attacker to inject properties into the prototype of JavaScript objects by providing an array like `[['__proto__'], 'polluted']` as a path. This is possible because when the bracket notation is used to access object properties, JavaScript converts the array to a string using `toString()` which results in `__proto__` and bypasses the check.
    *   **Incomplete Fix:** The vulnerability is a result of an incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability (CVE-2020-7736) where the fix focused on string inputs and not array inputs.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the prototype with unexpected values or functions, an attacker could cause JavaScript exceptions leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** In some cases, an attacker could achieve remote code execution by injecting malicious code through prototype pollution if the codebase executes a specific attribute.
    *   **Property Injection:** An attacker could inject properties that the codebase relies on, including security-related properties, potentially leading to privilege escalation or other unauthorized actions.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Server-Side:** Input from `req.query` parameters in GET requests or `req.body` in POST requests (if `express.json()` middleware is used) can be parsed as arrays or objects and used as an attack vector. The notation `parameter[]=value` in GET requests can be used to pass array values.
    *   **Client-Side:** Data coming from the `postMessage` API can also be of different types, allowing an attacker to pass array values.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have control over the input that is used by the vulnerable functions of the library to set the property of the object.
    *   The attacker can be in a client or server-side context, depending on how the input is provided.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The `bmoor` library version `<0.10.1` is affected.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by converting path components to strings before performing checks.
*   The vulnerability was reported by P.Adithya Srinivas, Masudul Hasan Masud Bhuiyan, and Cristian-Alexandru Staicu.

**Remediation:**

*   Upgrade the `bmoor` package to version 0.10.1 or higher.
*   Ensure input is properly sanitized before being used as a property path.
*   Convert the path to string type before checking.
*   Consider using objects without prototypes to break the prototype chain.
*   Use `Map` instead of `Object` where appropriate.

This information aligns with the provided CVE description by focusing on the prototype pollution issue resulting from a type confusion vulnerability within the `bmoor` package.
