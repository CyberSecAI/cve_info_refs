Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Keybase desktop client (for Windows, macOS, and Linux) fails to properly clear cached images, even after the user deletes them through normal means or uses the "Explode message/Explode now" functionality. This is due to insufficient cache clearing and the lack of encryption of the cached content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cleartext Storage:** Images are stored in cleartext (unencrypted) within the "uploadtemps" and "Cache" directories of the Keybase client.
*   **Insufficient Cache Clearing:** The application does not effectively remove cached images, even after user-initiated deletion actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker with local access to a user's machine can access sensitive images stored in the cache, potentially revealing PII or other private information.
*   **Compromised E2EE:** The vulnerability undermines Keybase's claim as a secure end-to-end encrypted communication platform, potentially impacting user trust and having legal ramifications.
*   **Legal Ramifications:** Private data stored insecurely could be used in court cases against individuals, further damaging the platform's reputation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local File System Access:** The primary attack vector is gaining access to the local file system of a user's machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker must have local access to the victim's computer.
*   **File System Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the locations of the Keybase cache directories on the specific OS.

**Additional details:**
* The issue was found in both `uploadtemps` and `Cache` directories, with the `Cache` containing significantly more images.
* Recovered images are in their original formats and easily viewable on macOS, while on windows the file extensions may need to be changed to view them.
* The issue existed on all three major desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, and Linux)

This vulnerability was addressed in Keybase client versions 5.6.0 (Windows and macOS) and 5.6.1 (Linux).
