- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When using the HTTP protocol, the user password is transmitted as a clear text parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can obtain the user password by intercepting the clear text parameter through a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack, specifically through the HTTP protocol.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be positioned to perform a MITM attack on the network traffic between the user and the Bosch device. No prior privileges are needed. User interaction is required for the password to be sent.
