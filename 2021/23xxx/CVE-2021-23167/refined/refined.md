- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper certificate validation in the SMTP client.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The application does not properly validate certificates when communicating with an SMTP server. This allows a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker to intercept and modify communication between the Command Centre server and the SMTP server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful MITM attack can enable an attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the Command Centre Server. The impact is rated as having high confidentiality impact, low integrity impact, and low availability impact.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack. The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the Command Centre server and the SMTP server (i.e. be a man-in-the-middle)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the network path between the Command Centre server and the SMTP server. The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction.
