Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23784:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `esc` function in the `tempura` library not properly sanitizing or escaping inputs that are not of type string. Specifically, when an object (like an array) is passed to the `esc` function, it is returned as is, without any escaping. This allows for the injection of malicious HTML or JavaScript code through template variables, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input sanitization: The `esc` function, intended for HTML escaping, fails to handle non-string inputs correctly by not escaping them.
- Type confusion: The vulnerability arises from the assumption that the input to `esc` will always be a string or that non-string inputs can be safely ignored.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Cross-site Scripting (XSS): An attacker can inject malicious client-side scripts (typically JavaScript or HTML) into a webpage.
- Session hijacking: XSS can be used to steal cookies and hijack user sessions.
- Information disclosure: Sensitive information can be exposed through XSS.
- Unauthorized access: Attackers can gain access to privileged services and functionality.
- Malware delivery: XSS can be used to deliver malware to users.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious code into data that will be processed by the `tempura` templating engine. Specifically, an attacker can inject the malicious script through an object (like an array) that will then be rendered by a template, because this input type bypasses the escaping logic of the vulnerable function.
- This could be triggered by user-provided content, if that content is used in tempura template.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input that is passed to a template that uses the `tempura` library.
- No special privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability. User interaction is required for the exploit to execute.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.4.0 of the `tempura` library.
- The fix involved ensuring that the `esc` function always returns a string by converting non-string inputs to strings and escaping them.
- This vulnerability is categorized as CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).
- The Snyk advisory provides a proof-of-concept showing how to exploit the vulnerability, by passing an array containing malicious HTML to a template through the `esc` function.
