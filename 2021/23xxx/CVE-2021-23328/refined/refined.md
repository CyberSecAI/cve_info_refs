Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23328:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how `iniparserjs` handles array concentration during the parsing of ini-style files. Specifically, the way the parser merges data, including user-controlled input, can lead to overwriting properties on the object prototype.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core issue is that the parser doesn't sanitize or validate the structure of the input properly. When handling array-like structures, it allows properties like `__proto__` to be set on the object's prototype. This is possible because of unsafe recursive merging of objects when processing user-controlled input. This occurs in  `ini_parser.js` when concentrating arrays.
- **Unsafe Object Recursive Merge:** The vulnerability is triggered due to the unsafe recursive merge logic within the parser. It appears to perform a recursive merge operation on the object, which if the source object contains `__proto__`, it can cause pollution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the prototype with unexpected values, attackers can cause the application to crash or become unresponsive, by causing JavaScript exceptions, especially if critical methods like `toString` or `valueOf` are overwritten.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In specific cases where the codebase evaluates object attributes, polluting the prototype could lead to arbitrary code execution. For example, if the application used `eval(someobject.someattr)`, polluting `someattr` could allow the attacker to execute code.
- **Property Injection:** The attacker can inject malicious properties into the prototype, which can be used to manipulate application logic or bypass security checks. For instance, injecting a property like `isAdmin` on the prototype might grant unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious INI file that includes specially crafted keys that can manipulate the prototype of Javascript objects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted INI file as input to the `iniparserjs` library. This could be directly, if the application uses user-provided file inputs, or indirectly if user input is included in the INI file processed by the application.
- No special privileges are required, as the vulnerability can be exploited through the normal operation of the library. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Details:**
- The `snyk.io` analysis provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) showing how a simple INI file can be used to pollute the object prototype.
- The analysis also provides various attack types (DoS, RCE, Property Injection), how to prevent this issue, and affected environments.
- The `npm` package information indicates that the package is deprecated and no longer supported.
