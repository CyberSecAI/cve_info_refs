Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The `ps-kill` package uses the `child_process.exec` function without proper sanitization of user-provided input within the `kill` function in its `index.js` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Arbitrary Command Injection:**  The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the `exec` function, leading to their execution on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system running the vulnerable application.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The CVSS v3.1 scores from the Snyk analysis indicate:
    - **Low Confidentiality Impact:** Access to restricted information is possible, but the control over what is obtained is limited.
    - **Low Integrity Impact:** Modification of data is possible, but the control over the consequence is limited.
    - **Low Availability Impact:** Performance may be reduced or there may be interruptions in resource availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:**  The vulnerability is considered remotely exploitable at the protocol level, meaning it can be exploited across network hops (e.g., over a router).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior access or authorization on the vulnerable system to carry out the attack.
- **No User Interaction:** Exploitation does not require any interaction from a user.
- The attacker needs to control the input given to the `kill` function.

**Additional Information:**

- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** A PoC is provided demonstrating how to inject a command (`touch success`).
- **CVSS Scores:** Both Snyk and NVD scores are provided with Snyk scoring it as a 5.6 Medium and NVD as a 9.8 Critical
- **No fix is currently available.**
