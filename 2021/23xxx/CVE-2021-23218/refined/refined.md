- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A memory leak occurs during TLS handshakes when Mirantis Container Runtime (MCR) is running with FIPS mode enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory Leak (CWE-401).
- **Impact of exploitation:** The memory leak can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based, triggered through TLS handshakes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special privileges required; an attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely. The system needs to be running Mirantis Container Runtime (MCR) with FIPS mode enabled.
