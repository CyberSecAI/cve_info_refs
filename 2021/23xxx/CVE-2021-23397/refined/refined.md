- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `@ianwalter/merge` package is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to an unsafe recursive merge function within its main `merge` function. This function recursively merges JavaScript objects, and when a source object contains a `__proto__` property, it allows for modifications to the `Object.prototype`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from the unsafe recursive merge function. When the source object contains a property named `__proto__`, the merge function improperly iterates into it, which can be used to modify properties of `Object.prototype`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to several impacts:
    -   **Denial of service (DoS):** By polluting properties like `toString` or `valueOf`, an attacker can cause JavaScript exceptions and lead to DoS.
    -   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In scenarios where the codebase evaluates and executes a polluted property (e.g., using `eval`), the attacker could execute arbitrary code.
    -   **Property Injection:**  Attackers can inject properties that the codebase relies on, such as `isAdmin` flags, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
-  **Attack vectors:** The primary attack vector is through crafting a malicious JSON object that includes a `__proto__` property, then merging this object into another using the vulnerable `merge` function. The vulnerability is exposed via the network stack, meaning that it can be exploited remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply the malicious JSON that gets merged by the vulnerable function, but requires no other privileges prior to the attack. The attack requires high complexity, meaning that a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will.
