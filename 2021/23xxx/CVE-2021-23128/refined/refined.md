Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-23128:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The core FOF (Framework on Framework) `FOFEncryptRandval` implementation used a potentially insecure method for generating random values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure Randomness: The original implementation of `FOFEncryptRandval` did not use a cryptographically secure method for generating random values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is considered **Low**. This suggests that while the vulnerability is present, it might not be easily exploitable or that the potential damage is limited. The specific impact is not detailed in the provided text, but could lead to predictability in the generated values when used in a security context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is present in the core Joomla! code. The attack vector would involve exploiting the insecurely generated random values when they are used in a security context. The exact vector for exploiting this weakness is not stated in the text.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to interact with components of the system that rely on the flawed `FOFEncryptRandval` implementation. Specific technical capabilities/position for exploiting this are not described.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code was unused.
- The vulnerability was addressed by replacing the insecure implementation with a call to `random_bytes()` and its backport from the `random_compat` library.
- The issue was coordinated with Akeeba Ltd, the original contributor of the FOF codebase.
- The vulnerability affects Joomla! CMS versions 3.2.0 - 3.9.24.
- The fix is included in Joomla! CMS version 3.9.25.
