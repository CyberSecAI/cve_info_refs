Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23403:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `Merge()` function of the `ts-nodash` library. This function performs an unsafe recursive merge of objects without proper validation of input, allowing for prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The `Merge()` function lacks input validation, making it susceptible to prototype pollution. By injecting a specially crafted JSON object containing `__proto__` into the `Merge` function, an attacker can modify the prototype of the base `Object`.
*   **Unsafe Recursive Merge:** The recursive merge logic does not properly handle properties named `__proto__` defined using `Object.defineProperty()`. This allows the attacker to modify the prototype of the `Object`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting object prototypes with unexpected values (e.g., changing `toString()` to an integer), attackers can cause JavaScript exceptions and potentially disrupt the application's functionality.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the application evaluates a polluted property and executes that evaluation (e.g., `eval(someobject.someattr)`), attackers may be able to inject and execute arbitrary code.
*   **Property Injection:** Attackers can manipulate informative properties (like security flags such as `isAdmin`) that the application uses, potentially leading to privilege escalation or other forms of unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious JSON payload that modifies the prototype through the vulnerable `Merge()` function in the library.
*   An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious object through the `Merge` function to modify the `Object.prototype`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to control the input to the vulnerable `Merge()` function. This could be achieved through various means depending on how the application uses the library and processes input.
*   No special privileges are needed; the attacker needs to provide a malicious object to the function call.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `ts-nodash` versions prior to 1.2.7.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to inject a `__proto__` property to pollute the object prototype using the `Merge()` function.
*   The Snyk analysis includes CVSS scores: 7.3 (High) according to their own assessment and 9.8 (Critical) according to NVD, which highlight the potential severity of the vulnerability.
*   The Snyk analysis also breaks down the CVSS metrics, indicating a network-based attack vector with low complexity, no required privileges or user interaction, and low confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.
*   The provided links point to the relevant commit and pull request that fixed the vulnerability.
