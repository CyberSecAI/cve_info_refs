Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23390:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the `U.set()` and `U.get()` functions in the `total4` Node.js framework handle user-provided paths. These functions dynamically construct and execute JavaScript code using the `Function` constructor based on the provided path. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code by manipulating the path argument, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Code Injection:** The `U.set()` and `U.get()` functions are vulnerable to code injection via the path argument.
*   **Dynamic Code Evaluation:** The use of `new Function()` to dynamically execute code based on user input is a major security risk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Compromise:** An attacker can gain complete control over the server, allowing them to read, modify, and delete files; install malware; steal sensitive data; and perform other malicious actions.
*   **Data Breach:** Confidential data can be compromised.
*   **Denial of Service:** The server can be made unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.
*   **Input Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious input to the path parameter of `U.set()` or `U.get()`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the server running the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of API Usage:** The attacker needs to be aware that the application makes use of the vulnerable `U.set()` or `U.get()` functions and be able to supply path parameters to these functions.

**Technical Details:**
The `utils.js` file contains the vulnerable `set` and `get` functions that use the Function constructor to dynamically generate and execute code based on the provided path.  The proof of concept provided shows how an attacker can inject code using a crafted path string:

```javascript
U.set({}, 'a;let {mainModule}=process; let {require}=mainModule; let {exec}=require("child_process"); exec("touch HACKED")//');
```
This code injects JavaScript that gets a reference to the main process, requires the child_process library, and executes the `touch HACKED` command, creating a file on the server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves upgrading the `total4` package to version 0.0.43 or higher.
*   The vulnerability has a high CVSS score of 9.8, indicating its critical nature.
