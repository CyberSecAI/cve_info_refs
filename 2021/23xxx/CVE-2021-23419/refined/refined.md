Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23419:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a prototype pollution issue in the `open-graph` npm package. The `parse` function could be manipulated to modify the `Object.prototype` by using `__proto__` or `constructor` payloads within the Open Graph meta tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is the ability to inject properties into the `Object.prototype`. This is achieved by processing user-controlled input (`__proto__` or `constructor` keys) in a way that allows the attacker to modify the base object prototype. This is due to the library not properly sanitizing or validating the property keys.
* **Unsafe Property Assignment:** The vulnerability arises due to a lack of input sanitization where property keys are not checked against known prototype pollution vectors before assignment or use.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the `Object.prototype`, an attacker can cause JavaScript exceptions, leading to a denial of service. This occurs if critical functions like `toString` or `valueOf` are overridden with invalid values which results in code execution failures.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In scenarios where the application evaluates object attributes and executes them (e.g., using `eval`), an attacker can pollute the prototype to inject and execute malicious code.
*   **Property Injection:** An attacker could inject arbitrary properties into the `Object.prototype`. This can lead to privilege escalation or other security breaches by modifying attributes that the application uses for security or privilege checks (e.g., `isAdmin`).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves injecting malicious content via the `og:` meta tag with a `__proto__` or `constructor` key.
*   This malicious content is then parsed using the vulnerable `open-graph` library.
*   The library processes this input without proper sanitization, leading to the prototype being modified.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to control the content that the `open-graph` library processes. This could be achieved by manipulating the content of a webpage which is being parsed by the application, or through some other means of injecting the malicious `og` meta tag into the system being parsed.
*   The attacker does not require any prior authentication or privileges on the system.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects versions of `open-graph` prior to 0.2.6.
*   The provided PoC demonstrates how an attacker can pollute the prototype by injecting an `og:__proto__:foo` meta tag.
*   The patch for this vulnerability involved filtering out the blacklisted keys like `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype` in the property names.
*   The Snyk advisory notes that the exploit maturity is high due to the availability of a proof-of-concept and detailed explanation.
* The CVSS score provided by Snyk is 7.3 (High), with attack vector as Network and attack complexity as Low. The NVD score was a critical 9.8.
