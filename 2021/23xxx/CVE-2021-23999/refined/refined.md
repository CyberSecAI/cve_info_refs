Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23999:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of Blob URLs when loaded through specific user interactions. The core issue lies in how the `ContentParent::TransmitBlobURLsForPrincipal` function handles the principal associated with Blob URLs during transmission to content processes. The function was using the principal passed to the function rather than the principal of the blob, potentially leading to a mismatch. Additionally, the code used `aPrincipal->Subsumes(aBlobPrincipal)` instead of `->Equals` which allowed an expanded or system principal to be used incorrectly. This was compounded by logic added to force blob URL registration in the content process before loading, which used `triggeringPrincipal` instead of the actual blob principal, leading to system principal being used when triggered from browser UI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect principal assignment:** Blob URLs could be incorrectly assigned the system principal instead of their actual principal.
- **Principal subsumption check:** Using `Subsumes` instead of `Equals` for principal comparison allowed elevated principals to be used incorrectly.
- **Incorrect triggering principal:**  Using `triggeringPrincipal` in certain scenarios led to incorrect principal assignment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege escalation:**  Blob URLs could be loaded with the system principal, granting them privileges they should not possess. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution by allowing the compromised content to interact with the browser in an unintended way.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack requires a specific sequence of user interactions such as pasting a Blob URL into the address bar.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to generate a Blob URL.
- The attacker needs to induce a user to load the Blob URL in a new tab or window, specifically through the address bar, or other UI elements that trigger the issue.
