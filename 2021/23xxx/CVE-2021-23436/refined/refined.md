Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-23436

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to a type confusion in the `applyPatches_` function of the `immer` library. The condition `(p === "__proto__" || p === "constructor")` is intended to prevent modification of the prototype chain. However, if the `path` parameter contains an array such as `['__proto__']` or `['constructor']`, the strict equality check (`===`) fails because the types are different (string vs array), thus bypassing the intended check, and allowing for prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is prototype pollution, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the prototype of JavaScript objects. This can have far-reaching consequences as these properties are then inherited by all objects in the application.
- **Type Confusion:** The vulnerability arises because the code does not correctly handle the case where `path` elements are arrays rather than strings when checking for `__proto__` or `constructor` properties.
- **Bypass of previous fix:** This vulnerability is a bypass of a previous fix for CVE-2020-28477, highlighting the difficulty of fully addressing prototype pollution issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By modifying critical prototype methods like `toString` or `valueOf`, an attacker can trigger exceptions and cause a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the application evaluates properties of an object (e.g., using `eval`), polluting a prototype property might allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code.
- **Property Injection:** By injecting properties used for security checks (e.g., admin status), attackers can manipulate application logic.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `applyPatches` function, where an attacker can manipulate the `path` parameter. Specifically by providing an array as a path element, e.g. `[['__proto__'], 'polluted']`.
- The vulnerability can be exploited via network requests that ultimately use user-controlled data to construct the `path` argument to the vulnerable function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `applyPatches` function, specifically the `path` argument.
- No user interaction is required for successful exploitation.
- The attacker does not need any prior access or privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in `immer` versions `7.0.0` and up to but not including `9.0.6`.
- The fix involves ensuring that the path elements are converted to strings before comparison with the reserved properties.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can pollute the prototype using an array in the path.
- Snyk gives this a medium severity with CVSS 5.6 score, while NVD gives it a critical severity with CVSS 9.8 score.
