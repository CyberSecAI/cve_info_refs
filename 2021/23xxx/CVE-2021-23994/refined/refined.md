### CVE-2021-23994
**Root cause:** A WebGL framebuffer was not initialized early enough.
**Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds write due to memory corruption.
**Impact:** Memory corruption and potential denial of service (crash).
**Attack vector:** Exploiting the WebGL API in a malicious webpage.
**Attacker capabilities:** Ability to craft a malicious WebGL program that triggers the vulnerability.
**Additional Details:** The vulnerability occurs during the execution of the `drawBuffers()` function after calling `deleteFramebuffer()`. The root cause is that the `mDrawBufferStates` and `mReadBufferState` variables are not initialized correctly in certain scenarios leading to a large value being passed to the memset function resulting in the OOB write.
