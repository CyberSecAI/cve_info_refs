### Threat Intelligence

Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof of conceptEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.
Check out the EPSS
[documentation](https://www.first.org/epss/articles/prob_percentile_bins)

[CVE-2021-23664  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-23664) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-918  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `@isomorphic-git/cors-proxy` to version 2.7.1 or higher.

## Overview

[@isomorphic-git/cors-proxy](https://www.npmjs.org/package/%40isomorphic-git/cors-proxy) is a Proxy clone and push requests for the browser

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to missing sanitization and validation of the redirection action in `middleware.js`.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

8.6 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities.

  **Changed**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**
