Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23664:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization and validation of the redirection action within the `middleware.js` file of the `@isomorphic-git/cors-proxy` package. Specifically, the proxy was following redirects without proper checks, allowing an attacker to manipulate the location header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The core vulnerability is an SSRF, where the server makes requests to attacker-controlled domains or internal resources based on user-supplied input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially cause the server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external URLs, leading to the following:
  - **Information disclosure:** Accessing sensitive information from internal services.
  - **Internal network scanning:** Mapping internal network infrastructure.
  - **Denial of service:** Making the server send numerous requests to the target.
  - **Accessing other external resources:** Potentially using the server as a stepping stone for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP request to the proxy server with a location header that redirects to a malicious URL.
- The `middleware.js` file was not validating the redirection target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable proxy server.
- No authentication is required for this attack.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided PoC demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability by sending a request with a malicious host header.
  - `GET /www.attacker-controlled-domain.com/info/refs?service=git-receive-pack HTTP/1.1`
  - `Host: target.com`
- **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.7.1 by preventing the proxy from automatically following redirects.
- **CVSS Score:** Snyk assigned a CVSS v3.1 score of 8.6 (High), while NVD assigned 7.5 (High).

**Summary of Fix from the github content:**

- The commit `1b1c91e71d946544d97ccc7cf0ac62b859e03311` in the isomorphic-git/cors-proxy repository addresses this vulnerability.
- The key change is in middleware.js, where the `redirect: 'manual'` option is added to the fetch request, preventing automatic following of redirects.
- The code now checks if the response has a location header and manually modifies the header before sending back to the client.
