constÂ gitlogÂ =Â require('gitlog');Â constÂ optionsÂ =Â Â Â Â {Â repo:Â __dirnameÂ +Â '/test-repo-folder'Â Â Â Â ,Â number:Â 20Â Â Â Â ,Â author:Â 'DomÂ Harrington'Â Â Â Â ,Â fields:Â Â Â Â Â Â [Â 'hash'Â Â Â Â Â Â ,Â 'abbrevHash'Â Â Â Â Â Â ,Â 'subject'Â Â Â Â Â Â ,Â 'authorName'Â Â Â Â Â Â ,Â 'authorDateRel'Â Â Â Â Â Â ]Â Â Â Â ,Â execOptions:Â Â Â Â Â Â {Â maxBuffer:Â 1000Â *Â 1024Â Â Â Â Â Â }Â Â Â Â };Â //Â AsynchronousÂ (withÂ Callback)gitlog(options,Â function(error,Â commits)Â {Â Â //Â CommitsÂ isÂ anÂ arrayÂ ofÂ commitsÂ inÂ theÂ repoÂ Â console.log(commits)});Â //Â SynchronousletÂ commitsÂ =Â gitlog(options);console.log(commits);
```
## Options

See [git log](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-log)

### repo

The location of the repo, required field.

### number

The number of commits to return, defaults to 10.

### since/after

Show commits more recent than a specific date.

### until/before

Show commits older than a specific date.

### author/committer

Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer header lines that match the specified pattern.

### nameStatus

Below fields was returned from the log:

* files - changed files names (array)
* status - changed files status (array)

This option is enabled by default.

### findCopiesHarder

Much more likely to set status codes to 'C' if files are exact copies of each other.

This option is disabled by default.

### all

Find commits on all branches instead of just on the current one.

This option is disabled by default.

### branch ([revision range](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#git-log-ltrevisionrangegt))

Show only commits in the specified branch or revision range.

By default uses the current branch and defaults to `HEAD` (i.e. the whole history leading to the current commit).

### execOptions

Type: `Object`

Specify some options to be passed to the [.exec()](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback) method:

* `cwd` String *Current working directory of the child process*
* `env` Object *Environment key-value pairs*
* `setsid` Boolean
* `encoding` String *(Default: 'utf8')*
* `timeout` Number *(Default: 0)*
* `maxBuffer` Number *(Default: 200\*1024)*
* `killSignal` String *(Default: 'SIGTERM')*

### optional fields

An array of fields to return from the log, here are the possible options:

* hash - the long hash of the commit e.g. 7dd0b07625203f69cd55d779d873f1adcffaa84a
* abbrevHash - the abbreviated commit hash e.g. 7dd0b07
* treeHash - the tree hash of the commit
* abbrevTreeHash - the abbreviated commit hash
* parentHashes - the parent hashes
* abbrevParentHashes - the abbreviated parent hashes
* authorName - author name of the commit
* authorEmail - author email of the commit
* authorDate - author date of the commit
* authorDateRel - relative author date of the commit
* committerName - committer name
* committerEmail - committer email
* committerDate - committer date
* committerDateRel - relative committer date
* subject - commit message (first line)
* body - commit body
* rawBody - raw body (subject + body)

Defaults to 'abbrevHash', 'hash', 'subject' and 'authorName'.

## How it works

This module works by executing a child process (using `child_process.exec()`) to the `git` executable, then parsing the stdout into commits. This is done using the `--pretty` command line option which allows you to provide a custom formatter to `git log`. To enable easy parsing the format is delimited by a tab (`\t`) character.

## Example

```
Â Â {Â hash:Â '6a7ef5e3b3d9c77743140443c8f9e792b0715721',Â Â Â Â abbrevHash:Â '6a7ef5e',Â Â Â Â treeHash:Â 'f1bf51b15b48a00c33727f364afef695029864c0',Â Â Â Â abbrevTreeHash:Â 'f1bf51b',Â Â Â Â parentHashes:Â 'cfe06dbdb8d0a193640977e016a04678f8f3b04f',Â Â Â Â abbrevParentHashes:Â 'cfe06dbdb8d0a193640977e016a04678f8f3b04f',Â Â Â Â authorName:Â 'DomÂ Harrington',Â Â Â Â authorEmail:Â 'dom@harringtonxxxxx',Â Â Â Â authorDate:Â '2015-04-09Â 09:39:23Â +0100',Â Â Â Â authorDateRel:Â '6Â daysÂ ago',Â Â Â Â committerName:Â 'DomÂ Harrington',Â Â Â Â committerEmail:Â 'dom@harringtonxxxxx',Â Â Â Â committerDate:Â 'ThuÂ AprÂ 9Â 09:39:23Â 2015Â +0100',Â Â Â Â committerDateRel:Â '6Â daysÂ ago',Â Â Â Â subject:Â '1.0.0',Â Â Â Â status:Â [Â 'M'Â ],Â Â Â Â files:Â [Â 'package.json'Â ]Â }

## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `gitlogplus`.

## Overview

[gitlogplus](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gitlogplus) is a Git log parser for Node.JS

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection via the main functionality, as `options` attributes are appended to the command to be executed without sanitization.

### PoC by Rafal Janicki

```
# 1. Run `npm i gitlogplus`
# 2. Run `mkdir git && git init git` (creates empty git repository as subdirectory to working directory)
# 3. Commit a file in the repository so that git log has been created
# 4. Run the below JavaScript PoC, which will create a folder HACKED in the parent directory of the new git repository

```
```
"use strict"

const gitlog = require('gitlogplus');
const options =
{
repo: __dirname + '/git',
number: '20; mkdir ../HACKED; git log '
};

let commits = gitlog(options);
console.log(commits);

```

* [HackerOne Report](https://hackerone.com/reports/808942)
### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

8.1 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**
