Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23412:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `gitlogplus` package directly passing user-provided `options` attributes to the `git log` command without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `number` option was vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. By crafting malicious input within the `options` object, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands into the `git log` command executed by the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the server or machine running the vulnerable application.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Depending on the permissions of the process running the application, this could lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:**  The attack is remotely exploitable over a network as the vulnerability exists within user-provided options that are passed to an API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to control the input passed as `options` to the `gitlog` function within a Node.js application utilizing the `gitlogplus` package. This could occur in various ways, depending on how the application is structured (e.g., through user input, configuration files, etc).
*   No special privileges are required.

**More Details:**

*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can inject a command to create a directory.
*   The `snyk.io` content confirms that the `number` option was used to inject shell commands, leading to the vulnerability, and there is no fixed version of the package.
*   The CVSS score from Snyk is 8.1 (High), while NVD gives 9.8 (Critical), indicating a serious security risk. The Snyk score breakdown details the Network attack vector, the High attack complexity and the potential for High confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.
