- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of date provided via `coverterCheckList` action in `meta_driver_srv.js` class. This allows an attacker to control the code execution flow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Code Injection (CWE-94). The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, leading to code injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated remote code execution. Attackers can force the IPM to connect to a rogue SNMP server and execute attacker-controlled code.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted packet to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network access to the vulnerable IPM instance is required, no prior authentication is needed.
