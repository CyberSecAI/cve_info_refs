- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of input from certain resources by the IPP software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, information disclosure, or other malicious activities. The CVSS score indicates a high impact on Integrity and Availability, with no impact on Confidentiality.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker requires access to the local subnet and needs administrator interaction to compromise the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the local subnet and needs an administrator to perform a specific action.
