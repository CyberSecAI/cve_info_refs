CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input ('Cross-site Scripting')

Eaton Intelligent Power Protector (IPP) prior to version 1.69 is vulnerable to stored Cross site scripting
attack. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of input from certain resources by the IPP
software. The attacker would need access to the local Subnet and an administrator interaction to
compromise the system.

Remediation & Mitigation

Remediation

Eaton has patched the security issue and new version of the affected software has been released.
The latest version can be downloaded from below location: -

Eaton IPP v1.69 – Download software | Power management | Eaton

Mitigation

Eaton recommends the users to follow the Security best practices and configure the logical access
mechanisms provided in IPP to safeguard the application from unauthorized access. Use the
available access control mechanisms in IPP properly to ensure that access to the system where IPP
application is installed and to the application is restricted to legitimate users only. Ensure that the
users are restricted to only the privilege levels necessary to complete their job roles/functions.

General Security Best Practices

•  Restrict exposure to external networks for all control system devices and/or systems and

ensure that they are not directly accessible from the open Internet.

•  Deploy control system networks and remote devices behind barrier devices (e.g. firewalls,

data diodes) and isolate them from business networks.

•  Remote access to control system networks should be made available on a strict need-to-use
basis. Remote access should use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs),
updated to the most current version available.

•  Regularly update/patch software/applications to latest versions available, as applicable.
•  Enable audit logs on all devices and applications.
•  Disable/deactivate unused communication channels, TCP/UDP ports and services (e.g.,

SNMP, FTP, BootP, DHCP, etc.) on networked devices.

•  Create security zones for devices with common security requirements using barrier devices

(e.g. firewalls, data diodes).

•  Change default passwords following initial startup. Use complex secure passwords or

passphrases.

•  Perform regular security assessments and risk analysis of networked control systems.
