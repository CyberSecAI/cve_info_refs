Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23352:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `madge` package allows users to specify a custom path to Graphviz executables via the `graphVizPath` option. This path is then used in a call to `child_process.exec`, which is vulnerable to command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The core issue is that the user-provided `graphVizPath` is not properly sanitized before being passed to `child_process.exec`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the execution string.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system where the `madge` package is used. This could lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability impact**: Snyk indicates high impact on confidentiality, low impact on integrity and availability, and an unchanged scope. NVD indicates a critical impact.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `.image()`, `.svg()`, or `.dot()` functions are called after initializing `madge` with a malicious `graphVizPath`.
- The attacker needs to be able to control the `graphVizPath` option when calling the `madge` functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious `graphVizPath` option to the `madge` constructor. This could happen in various scenarios:
  - If the application takes user input that directly or indirectly populates the `graphVizPath` option.
  - If an attacker has write access to the configuration files or environment variables that influence the `graphVizPath`.
- Network access is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

- The provided GitHub commit ([https://github.com/pahen/madge/commit/da5cbc9ab30372d687fa7c324b22af7ffa5c6332](https://github.com/pahen/madge/commit/da5cbc9ab30372d687fa7c324b22af7ffa5c6332)) fixes this vulnerability by changing `child_process.exec` to `child_process.execFile` and explicitly passing `gvpr -V` as arguments to the executable, preventing command injection through `graphVizPath`.
- Snyk provides a proof of concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability by using `touch HELLO;` as a malicious `graphVizPath` that successfully creates a file in the current directory where the madge command is executed.
- The vulnerable code is located in `lib/graph.js` specifically the `checkGraphvizInstalled` function before the fix.
