#### Introduced: 5 Mar 2021

[CVE-2021-23352  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-23352) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-89  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `madge` to version 4.0.1 or higher.

## Overview

[madge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/madge) is a Madge is a developer tool for generating a visual graph of your module dependencies, finding circular dependencies, and give you other useful info.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection. It is possible to specify a custom Graphviz path via the `graphVizPath` option parameter which when the `.image()`, `.svg()` or `.dot()` functions are called, is executed by the `childprocess.exec` function.

### PoC

```
1. install `madge` module: `npm i madge`
2. run the following poc.js:

// Example taken from: <https://github.com/pahen/madge#svg>

const madge = require('madge');
madge('..', {graphVizPath: "touch HELLO;"})
.then((res) => res.svg())
.then((writtenImagePath) => {
console.log('Image written to ' + writtenImagePath);
});

```

* [Vulnerable Code](https://github.com/pahen/madge/blob/master/lib/graph.js#L27)
### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

8.6 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**
