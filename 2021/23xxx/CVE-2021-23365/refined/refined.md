Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23365:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The content directly references CVE-2021-23365 and explicitly states that it is related to an authentication bypass vulnerability in the `github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-identity-broker` package.
   - The vulnerability stems from how the Go XML parser handles SAML authentication, as detailed in the provided links.
   - The description from snyk.io confirms that the vulnerability exists due to the XML parser not guaranteeing integrity in XML round-trips (encoding/decoding XML data).

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the Go standard library's XML parser (`encoding/xml`).
   - The `encoding/xml` package does not guarantee that XML data is encoded and decoded accurately; specifically, it can change the structure or content of the XML during processing.
   - This lack of round-trip stability in the XML parsing process allows for potential manipulation of SAML assertions, which are XML documents.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **XML Signature Wrapping:** The core weakness is related to the XML signature wrapping vulnerability, where an attacker can manipulate the XML structure while maintaining a valid signature, thereby bypassing authentication checks.
   - **Lack of XML Integrity:**  The Go XML parser doesn't provide guarantees that an XML document will remain unchanged through parsing and re-encoding. This is the underlying issue making the signature wrapping attack possible.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Authentication Bypass:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass SAML authentication. This means they can gain unauthorized access to systems and applications that rely on the vulnerable SAML implementation.
   - **Confidentiality & Integrity:** The vulnerability allows for modification of the SAML assertion which means there is a risk of loss of confidentiality as well as modification of data.
   - Depending on the application the impact could range from access to personal data to access to internal infrastructure.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Network:**  The attack vector is over the network, making it remotely exploitable.
   - The vulnerable component listens on the network and is accessible by any potential attacker.
   - Attacker can send malicious SAML responses to the vulnerable endpoint.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **No Prior Authorization Required:** Attackers do not need any prior access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
   - **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service that uses the flawed SAML implementation.
   - **Knowledge of SAML:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of SAML protocol to craft malicious SAML responses.
   - The attacker can be outside the organization's network.

**7. Additional Information:**

   - The fix implemented involved integrating `github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator` to enforce XML round-trip integrity.
   - The Go team has chosen not to provide a native fix in the standard library since round trip stability isn't a supported security property of the XML encoding package.
   - The vulnerability was fixed by upgrading the `github.com/crewjam/saml` dependency to v0.4.5 and incorporating the `xml-roundtrip-validator`.

In summary, CVE-2021-23365 is a critical vulnerability that could lead to full SAML authentication bypass via crafted SAML assertions due to the lack of XML round-trip stability in the go standard library's XML parser. This is a remotely exploitable vulnerability that requires no prior access to the system, which makes it a significant security risk.
