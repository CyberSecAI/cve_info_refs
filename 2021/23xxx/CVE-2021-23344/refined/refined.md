Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-23344

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the `U.set()` method in `total.js` processes input. It constructs a JavaScript expression based on user-provided input and executes it using the `Function` constructor. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the expression, leading to remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The core vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code remotely.
- **Code Injection:** The `U.set()` method does not properly sanitize the input used to build the JavaScript expression.
- **Unsafe use of `Function` constructor:** The usage of `new Function()` with user-controlled data is inherently dangerous and allows for code injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete Loss of Confidentiality:** An attacker can access all resources within the impacted component.
- **Complete Loss of Integrity:** An attacker can modify any/all files protected by the impacted component.
- **Complete Loss of Availability:** An attacker can fully deny access to resources in the impacted component.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network. The attacker does not need any prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted input to the vulnerable `U.set()` method.
- No special privileges or user interaction is required for exploitation.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is in the `utils.js` file of `total.js`.
- The `U.set()` method takes an object, a path, and a value as input.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the path argument contains malicious code which is then included in the dynamically created function and executed via `new Function()`.
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates this by injecting `eval` and executing an OS command `touch pwned`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves adding a check for `__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`, and `eval` keywords in the generated expression before execution.
- The vulnerability affects `total.js` versions prior to 3.4.8.

This is more detailed than the typical CVE description and includes a proof-of-concept.
