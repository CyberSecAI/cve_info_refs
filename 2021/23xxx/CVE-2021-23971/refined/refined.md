Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-23971:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from Firefox's incorrect handling of `Referrer-Policy` headers during HTTP redirects. When a redirect response includes a `Referrer-Policy` header, Firefox incorrectly used the document's URL as the referrer source instead of the previously computed referrer value of the original request when determining the new referrer for the redirected request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Referrer Policy Override:** Firefox incorrectly adopts the `Referrer-Policy` from a redirect, potentially overriding the intended policy of the original page.
- **Information Disclosure:**  This override can lead to the full referrer URL being sent in subsequent requests even when the original policy was set to restrict the information (e.g.,  `no-referrer` or `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privacy Breach:** Full referrer URLs may contain sensitive user data, potentially allowing identification of the user or revealing browsing history.
- **Security Risk:**  The disclosure of full URLs may expose session identifiers or capability URLs, which can be exploited for malicious purposes.
- **Bypassing Intended Security:** Websites relying on strict referrer policies to limit information exposure are vulnerable to having this policy overridden, causing unintended data disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Redirects:** A malicious server (or a compromised third-party server) can send an HTTP redirect response with a `Referrer-Policy` header.
- **Conflicting Policies:** The malicious `Referrer-Policy` in the redirect response overrides the original page's intended policy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Man-in-the-Middle:** An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by controlling a server involved in a redirect chain.
- **Compromised Third-Party:** A compromised third-party server could inject malicious redirects.
- **Control over a server:** The attacker needs to control a server capable of sending HTTP redirects with specific `Referrer-Policy` headers.

**Additional Notes:**

- The bug report notes that this issue arises due to incorrect use of `OriginalReferrer` instead of `ComputedReferrer` when determining the referrer during a redirect.
- The vulnerability is described as a bypass for an opt-in mitigation feature (Referrer-Policy), which is why it was initially rated as "sec-moderate".
- The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 86 by using the `ComputedReferrer` instead of `OriginalReferrer` when calculating the referrer for a redirect.
- The fix also involved adding a new test to the web-platform-tests suite to ensure this issue does not occur again.
