Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23460:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `set` method in the `min-dash` library not properly validating the types of keys used to set properties on an object. This lack of validation allows an attacker to use special keys like `__proto__` and `constructor` to modify the prototype of the base Object, leading to prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core weakness is the ability to inject properties into the prototypes of JavaScript objects. This is achieved because the `set` function does not enforce key types and allows the use of `__proto__` and `constructor` as keys.
*   **Missing Key Type Enforcement:** The `set` method in `lib/object.js` does not validate if the provided key is a string or a number, which leads to the ability to pass an array or object as a key.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting `Object.prototype` with values of incorrect type, an attacker can cause the application to fail with exceptions when relying on methods like `toString` and `valueOf`.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In scenarios where the codebase evaluates attributes of an object and executes them (e.g., using `eval`), an attacker can pollute `Object.prototype` to inject malicious code.
*   **Property Injection:** An attacker could inject properties that the application relies on for informative or security purposes (e.g. modifying isAdmin to true).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered via the `set` method of the `min-dash` library. An attacker needs to be able to provide a specific path with `__proto__` or `constructor` as keys to pollute the prototypes.
* The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack, making it remotely exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to influence or control the `path` argument passed to the `set` function within the application that uses the vulnerable `min-dash` library.
* No user interaction or authentication is required.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by using an array as the path with `__proto__` as the key e.g. `set({}, [["__proto__"], "polluted"], "success")`

*   The fix implemented in commit `5ab05cbc4fd8d5eafb7db540c491ed0906b9d320` adds key type enforcement to prevent this kind of exploitation, specifically throwing an error if the key type is not a number or string, and if the key is `constructor` or `__proto__`.

*   The vulnerability exists in `min-dash` versions prior to 3.8.1.

*   Snyk provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the exploitation.
