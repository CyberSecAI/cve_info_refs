Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23340:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `downloadCsvAction` function of the `CustomReportController` class within the pimcore/pimcore package.
- The `exportFile` variable, obtained from a GET request parameter, is not properly sanitized before being used to construct a file path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The lack of sanitization of the `exportFile` parameter allows an attacker to include local files by manipulating the path (e.g., using "../" sequences). This is a classic LFI vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Breach:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as configuration files, database credentials, and potentially user data. In the provided PoC, the attacker is able to read the `/etc/passwd` file, which contains user information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to the `/admin/reports/custom-report/download-csv` endpoint.
- **Malicious `exportFile` Parameter:** The attacker injects a manipulated `exportFile` parameter containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the pimcore application to access the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the application server over the network.
