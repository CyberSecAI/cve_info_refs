## How to fix?

Upgrade `pimcore/pimcore` to version 6.8.8 or higher.

## Overview

[pimcore/pimcore](https://packagist.org/packages/pimcore/pimcore) is a content & product management framework (CMS/PIM/E-Commerce).

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Local File Inclusion. A Local FIle Inclusion vulnerability exists in the `downloadCsvAction` function of the `CustomReportController` class (`bundles/AdminBundle/Controller/Reports/CustomReportController.php`). An authenticated user can reach this function with a GET request at the following endpoint: `/admin/reports/custom-report/download-csv?exportFile=&#91;filename]`. Since `exportFile` variable is not sanitized, an attacker can exploit a local file inclusion vulnerability.

### PoC

```
* Login in Pimcore
* Send a GET request to the endpoint: /admin/reports/custom-report/download-csv?exportFile=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd to retrieve del passwd file of the Linux system. (Inside the request insert the header X-pimcore-csrf-token).

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.1 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker requires privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges has the ability to access only non-sensitive resources.

  **Low**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**
