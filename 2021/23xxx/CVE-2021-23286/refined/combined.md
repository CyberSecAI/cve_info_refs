Affected Product(s) and Version(s)

Here is the list of affected products –

•  Eaton Intelligent Power Manager Infrastructure (IPM Infrastructure)– all versions including

1.5.0plus205

Mitigation

Mitigation

The product has reached its End Of Life, the notification has been posted at: Lifecycle Notification.

The transition to IPM Monitor Edition is in progress. Refer the Product page for further details.

Until the transition is complete, Eaton recommends that the below guidelines should be followed.

To prevent the exploitation of the issues and safeguard the software from malicious entities, ensure
access to the system is provided to the known users and the credentials are secured.

General Security Best Practices

•  Restrict exposure to external networks for all control system devices and/or systems and

ensure that they are not directly accessible from the open Internet.

•  Deploy control system networks and remote devices behind barrier devices (e.g. firewalls,

data diodes) and isolate them from business networks.

•  Remote access to control system networks should be made available on a strict need-to-use
basis. Remote access should use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs),
updated to the most current version available.

•  Regularly update/patch software/applications to latest versions available, as applicable.
•  Enable audit logs on all devices and applications.
•  Disable/deactivate unused communication channels, TCP/UDP ports and services (e.g.,

SNMP, FTP, BootP, DHCP, etc.) on networked devices.

•  Create security zones for devices with common security requirements using barrier devices

(e.g. firewalls, data diodes).
