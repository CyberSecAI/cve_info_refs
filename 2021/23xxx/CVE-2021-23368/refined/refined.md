Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23368:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the `postcss` package during source map parsing. The regular expression used to extract the sourceMappingURL from CSS comments is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerable regular expression is located in the `getAnnotationURL()` function within the `lib/previous-map.js` file.
- The regex `/\/\\*\s\*# sourceMappingURL=(.\*)\s\*\\*\//` (and a slight variation `/\/\\*\s\*# sourceMappingURL=(.\*)\\*\//`) used to extract the sourceMappingURL is susceptible to ReDoS.
- Specifically, the `(.*)` part of the regex, combined with the surrounding optional whitespace `\s*`, can cause excessive backtracking when processing specially crafted input strings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can craft malicious CSS input strings that, when parsed by `postcss`, will cause the regular expression to take an excessive amount of time and CPU resources to process.
- This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) by making the system unresponsive to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the parsing of CSS files.
- Attackers need to provide malicious CSS content containing source map URLs with a large amount of whitespace characters to trigger the catastrophic backtracking.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply CSS to a system that uses a vulnerable version of `postcss`.
- This can be achieved in various scenarios, such as when processing user-submitted CSS in online tools or when dealing with untrusted CSS sources in server-side applications.
- No specific privileges or user interactions are needed.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects `postcss` versions >=7.0.0 <7.0.36 and >=8.0.0 <8.2.10.
- The fix involves changing the vulnerable regex to avoid the catastrophic backtracking issue by removing the optional whitespace `\s*` after `(.*)`.
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how to construct a malicious string to trigger the ReDoS.
- The vulnerability is considered a "medium" severity issue.

This information provides a detailed understanding of the vulnerability, its cause, impact, and how it can be exploited.
