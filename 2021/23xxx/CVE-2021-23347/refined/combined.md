### Threat Intelligence

EPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.
Check out the EPSS
[documentation](https://www.first.org/epss/articles/prob_percentile_bins)
for more details.

#### Introduced: 22 Feb 2021

[CVE-2021-23347  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-23347) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-79  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/cmd` to version 1.7.13, 1.8.6 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) the SSO provider connected to Argo CD would have to send back a malicious error message containing JavaScript to the user.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

4.7 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker requires privileges that provide significant (e.g., administrative) control over the vulnerable component allowing access to component-wide settings and files.

  **High**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**

Signed-off-by: jannfis jann@mistrust.net

Fixes <https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/code-scanning/46>

While I believe this is not a serious issue in the real world, and at least would require a rogue SSO backend for successful exploitation, it should be fixed.

Note on DCO:

If the DCO action in the integration test fails, one or more of your commits are not signed off. Please click on the *Details* link next to the DCO action for instructions on how to resolve this.

Checklist:

* Either (a) I've created an [enhancement proposal](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/new/choose) and discussed it with the community, (b) this is a bug fix, or (c) this does not need to be in the release notes.
* The title of the PR states what changed and the related issues number (used for the release note).
* I've included "Closes [ISSUE #]" or "Fixes [ISSUE #]" in the description to automatically close the associated issue.
* I've updated both the CLI and UI to expose my feature, or I plan to submit a second PR with them.
* Does this PR require documentation updates?
* I've updated documentation as required by this PR.
* Optional. My organization is added to USERS.md.
* I have signed off all my commits as required by [DCO](https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj/tree/master/community#contributing-to-argo)
* I have written unit and/or e2e tests for my change. PRs without these are unlikely to be merged.
* My build is green ([troubleshooting builds](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer-guide/ci/)).
