Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper HTML escaping of error messages received from the SSO provider within the Argo CD command-line interface (CLI).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. When a malicious error message containing JavaScript is sent back from the SSO provider to Argo CD, the CLI does not properly escape the HTML, allowing the JavaScript to execute in the user's context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the Argo CD CLI user. This can lead to various impacts depending on the actions the user is authorized to perform and how the system is configured. While the provided information doesn't specify particular impacts, common XSS attacks could include:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Credential theft
    *   Malicious actions on behalf of the user
    *   Redirection to phishing sites

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The attack vector is network-based. The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the response sent back by the SSO provider.
*   **SSO Provider Manipulation:** The attacker needs to compromise or control a SSO provider connected to Argo CD, in order to send a malicious error message containing Javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Compromised/Malicious SSO Provider:** The attacker needs access to, or control over, the SSO provider that the Argo CD instance uses. This control would allow them to craft and send a malicious error message back to the Argo CD CLI client.
*   **Network Reachability:** The attacker must be able to communicate with the Argo CD instance via the network.
*   **No user interaction:**  The attack does not require any user interaction to be successful

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability was fixed by properly escaping the HTML in the error message returned from the SSO provider.
* The fix was included in versions 1.7.13, 1.8.6, and higher.
* The severity is rated as medium with a CVSS score of 4.7 (Snyk) and 4.8 (NVD).
