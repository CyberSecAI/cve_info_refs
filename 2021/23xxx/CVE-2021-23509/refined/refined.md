Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-23509

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to a type confusion in the `json-ptr` library. Specifically, the `JsonPointer.set` function, when provided with an array as part of the path, fails to prevent prototype pollution, allowing attackers to modify the prototype of `Object`. This bypasses the protections that were intended to prevent prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is the ability to inject properties into the prototype of JavaScript objects, specifically `Object.prototype`.
- **Type Confusion:** The library incorrectly handles array inputs in the path parameter, leading to the bypass of prototype pollution prevention mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to several types of attacks:
    -   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting `Object.prototype` with unexpected values, the application can crash or become unusable by triggering JavaScript exceptions. For example, polluting `Object.prototype.toString` with an integer would break any code relying on `someobject.toString()`.
    -   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In scenarios where the codebase evaluates attributes of an object, such as `eval(someobject.someattr)`, an attacker can pollute the prototype and inject malicious code that will be executed by the application.
    -   **Property Injection:** Attackers can pollute properties used for informative or security purposes, like `someuser.isAdmin`, to gain unauthorized access or modify application behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `JsonPointer.set` function of the `json-ptr` library.
- Attackers manipulate the `pointer` parameter by providing arrays as part of the path, which bypasses the intended prototype pollution prevention. For example, `[['proto'], 'polluted']`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the vulnerable `JsonPointer.set` function, specifically the "path" argument.
- No prior authentication or special privileges are required as the vulnerability is triggered by input manipulation.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Alessio Della Libera of the Snyk Research Team.
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 3.0.0 of `json-ptr`
- The fix involves adding checks within the `setValueAtPath` and `unsetValueAtPath` functions to prevent setting values on `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype` properties, or their array forms. It also throws an error if the path segment is not a string or number.
- The fix was implemented in [this commit](https://github.com/flitbit/json-ptr/commit/5dc458fbad1c382a2e3ca6d62e66ede3d92849ca).
