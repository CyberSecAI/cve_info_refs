## How to fix?

Upgrade `org.webjars.npm:path-parse` to version 1.0.7 or higher.

## Overview

[org.webjars.npm:path-parse](https://www.npmjs.org/package/path-parse) is a Node.js path.parse() ponyfill

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via `splitDeviceRe`, `splitTailRe`, and `splitPathRe` regular expressions. ReDoS exhibits polynomial worst-case time complexity.

### PoC

```
var pathParse = require('path-parse');
function build_attack(n) {
    var ret = ""
    for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        ret += "/"
    }
    return ret + "◎";
}

for(var i = 1; i <= 5000000; i++) {
    if (i % 10000 == 0) {
        var time = Date.now();
        var attack_str = build_attack(i)
        pathParse(attack_str);
        var time_cost = Date.now() - time;
        console.log("attack_str.length: " + attack_str.length + ": " + time_cost+" ms")
 }
}

```
## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.

The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.

Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:

```
regex = /A(B|C+)+D/

```

This regular expression accomplishes the following:

* `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'
* `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
* `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'

The expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`

It most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:

```
$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test("ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD")'
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test("ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX")'
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total

```

The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.

Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as *catastrophic backtracking*.

Let's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: "ACCCX". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:

1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.

The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.

From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.

| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACCCX | 3 | 38 |
| ACCCCX | 4 | 71 |
| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136 |
| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553 |

By the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

| Hi,  I would like to report two Regular Expression Denial of Service (REDoS) vulnerabilities in `path-parse`.  It allows cause a denial of service when parsing crafted invalid paths.  You can execute the code below to reproduce the vulnerability.​  ``` var pathParse = require('path-parse'); function build_attack(n) {     var ret = ""     for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {         ret += "/"     }     return ret + "◎"; }  for(var i = 1; i <= 5000000; i++) {     if (i % 10000 == 0) {         var time = Date.now();         var attack_str = build_attack(i)         pathParse(attack_str);         var time_cost = Date.now() - time;         console.log("attack_str.length: " + attack_str.length + ": " + time_cost+" ms")  } } ```  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.  Best regards, Yeting Li​​​​ |

| If there aren't any other takers, I would be happy to maintain it, since the organisation that I work for, ForgeRock, also has interest in this package not having security vulnerabilities.  Alternatively, having multiple maintainers may be a good idea, for a higher chance of changes like this being made. |

| I have an extensive history with regexes from my Perl days. Even though node doesn't support `(?>...)`, I can think of one quick solution, which is replacing `[\s\S]*?` with a more specific pattern. |

| The regexes could stand a bit more tweaking to make them a little simpler.  `(\/?|)` is redundant and should just be `(\/?)`, for example. |

| [@jbgutierrez](https://github.com/jbgutierrez) [@ljharb](https://github.com/ljharb) Is there any update on fixing this vulnerability? There is already a PR open to fix this and there doesn't seem to be anyone disagreeing with the fix, so can we merge the PR and deploy v1.0.7 to get this security issue removed?  The resolve library is using this dependency, and the Angular CLI has started using resolve as a dependency since v11. Our security team does not want open vulnerabilities in our Angular codebase (regardless of its actual potential for misuse, which is the better approach to security anyways), so we are delaying on Angular v10 to avoid triggering this on our security scans. |

| [@n8ores](https://github.com/n8ores) It looks like [@jbgutierrez](https://github.com/jbgutierrez) just merged PR [#10](https://github.com/jbgutierrez/path-parse/pull/10) to fix the redos issue and he published v1.0.7 to the npm registry so you should be good there.  [@ljharb](https://github.com/ljharb) would just need to update browserify to point to the new dependency and ideally the Angular dependency issue should be fixed in the next minor version.  However, I'm not sure how to update the official [snyk.io](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-PATHPARSE-1077067) page for this vulnerability so that it shows the new fix version. Maybe [@yetingli](https://github.com/yetingli) could help with that? |
