Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of untrusted data within the `RunProcess` class of the `codeception/codeception` package. This class can be used as a gadget to execute arbitrary commands when user-supplied data is deserialized without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation before deserializing data, specifically when handling the `RunProcess` class. Deserialization of untrusted data allows for manipulation of the object's state and execution flow.
- **Gadget Exploitation:** The `RunProcess` class can be misused as a gadget, enabling attackers to trigger system commands via deserialization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server where the vulnerable application is running.
- **Complete Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The provided CVSS vector suggests a high impact on confidentiality and integrity with low impact on availability, which could lead to:
    - **Confidentiality Breach:** Exposure of sensitive data by gaining access to critical system information.
    - **Integrity Breach:** Unauthorized modification of files or system configurations.
    - **Availability Impact:** Disruptions in resource availability, which could affect legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based Attacks:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker can exploit it over a network.
- **Deserialization Trigger:** Attackers need to induce the vulnerable application to deserialize malicious data. This could occur wherever user-supplied serialized data is used, for example through user inputs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
- **Ability to Provide Malicious Data:** The attacker needs to be able to inject specially crafted serialized data that triggers the vulnerability.
- **No Authentication Needed**: The attacker doesn't require any prior authentication or privileges.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects `codeception/codeception` versions >=4.0.0 and <4.1.22 and versions < 3.1.3
- A proof of concept (PoC) exploit exists and is publicly available
- The fix for this vulnerability was to disable deserialization of the `RunProcess` class, as shown in the provided GitHub pull request.

This is a critical vulnerability due to its potential for arbitrary command execution and severe impact, which is reflected in the high CVSS scores provided by both Snyk and NVD.
