  "vulnerability_details": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-23440",
    "description": "The set-value npm package before versions 2.0.1, 3.0.3 and 4.0.1 is vulnerable to prototype pollution. A type confusion vulnerability can lead to a bypass of CVE-2019-10747 when the user-provided keys used in the path parameter are arrays.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a type confusion issue within the `set-value` package. When the 'path' parameter, intended to specify the location for setting a value, receives an array instead of a string, it bypasses the intended security checks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Prototype Pollution",
      "Type Confusion",
        "Bypass of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject properties into JavaScript Object prototypes. This could lead to:\n\t* Denial of service (DoS) by triggering JavaScript exceptions.\n\t* Remote code execution by tampering with the application source code.\n\t* Property injection which manipulates the codebase's expected behaviour",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves crafting a malicious input to the `set-value` function, specifically by providing an array as the path parameter.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the `path` parameter in the `set-value` function. This could happen when user-provided data is used to construct the path.",
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is triggered when the path components are not strings, leading to a bypass of input validation introduced to prevent prototype pollution. Patched versions include 2.0.1, 3.0.3, 4.0.1 and higher."
