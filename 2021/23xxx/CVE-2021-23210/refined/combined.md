# We have moved to GitLab!

As we [have previously announced](https://lists.archlinux.org/hyperkitty/list/arch-dev-public%40lists.archlinux.org/thread/WYXDTJ3TR2DWRQCDZK44BQDH67IDVGTS/) the flyspray bugtracker has been replaced by a GitLab based workflow!

Please report any new bugs there, you can click [here](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages) to go GitLab instead.

The bugtracker will remain available as a static copy so that links (for example the randomly picked [Task #56716](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/56716)) are still stable, migrated bugs have a closing comment pointing to the new URL on GitLab. If that is not sufficient you can also find a JSON formatted mapping from flyspray ID to GitLab URL [here](flyspray-id-mapping.json).
