Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23970:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stemmed from the inclusion of context-specific code within a shared jump table in the WebAssembly (Wasm) implementation. This was caused by a flawed patch (bug 1660862) that introduced the issue by patching context-specific code into a shared jump table.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Compartment Mismatch:** The core issue was that the shared jump table, intended to be context-agnostic and shared across threads, ended up with code that was tied to a specific context/thread.
- **Incorrect Context Handling:** The code was loading the JSContext from the main thread instead of the thread-local storage, leading to incorrect context being used in multithreaded scenarios.
- **Race Condition:** Due to the flawed patch and the context-specific code within the shared jump table, a race condition was created between threads, which resulted in incorrect code being executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Assertion Failures/Crashes:** The primary impact was crashing the browser due to assertion failures related to context mismatches when using multithreaded Wasm code.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** The advisory mentions a "slight risk of security exploit." Although not directly exploited in the described scenario, memory corruption is a possibility with the underlying issues that could lead to arbitrary code execution with sufficient effort.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Multithreaded WebAssembly:** The attack vector was through the use of multithreaded WebAssembly code. A malicious webpage could use multithreaded Wasm to trigger this bug.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to serve malicious Wasm:** The attacker needs the ability to serve or include malicious or crafted WebAssembly code in a webpage.
- **Knowledge of Multithreading:** An understanding of multithreading in Wasm would be needed to trigger this bug reliably.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was a regression caused by a previous patch intended to improve performance.
- The fix involved generating a context-agnostic interpreter stub, which would delegate to the correct context-specific stub, ensuring that threads would not execute code with the wrong context.
- The bug was triggered by using a large Wasm blob that utilized multiple threads.
- The issue was resolved by ensuring the context-specific interpreter stub is retrieved only when needed through a C++ call from a shared trampoline.
- The fix was uplifted to Firefox Beta and later released in Firefox 86.
