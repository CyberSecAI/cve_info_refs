## Summary

A security vulnerability affects the Bosch B426, B426-CN/B429-CN, and B426-M. The vulnerability is exploitable via the network interface. Bosch rates this vulnerability at 8.0 (High) and recommends customers to update vulnerable components with fixed software versions.

A second vulnerable condition was found when using http protocol, in which the user password is transmitted as a clear text parameter. Latest firmware versions allow only https.

If a software update is not possible in a timely manner, a reduction in the systems network exposure is advised. Internet-accessible systems should be firewalled. Additional protective steps like network isolation by VLAN.

These vulnerabilities were reported by Chizuru Toyama of TXOne IoT/ICS Security Research Labs of Trend Micro.

### Impact

Under certain circumstances, a malicious or unintended user could gain access to the B426 web server and access the configuration pages without needing to enter login credentials.

## Solution and Mitigations

### Software Updates

The recommended approach is to update the software of affected Bosch products to a fixed version. If an update is not possible in a timely manner, the mitigation approaches Firewalling and IP Filtering can be utilized. A list of affected and fixed firmware versions is available in the âAffected Productsâ section of this document. A fixed B426, B426-CN/B429-CN and B426-M versions are available on the Bosch Product Catalog

### Firewalling (Network)

It is advised that the devices should not be exposed directly to the internet or other insecure networks. This includes port-forwarding, which would not protect devices adequately. Firewalling a device significantly reduces its attack surface.

### Other

 Ensure that the "Web and Automation Security" setting for the B426 is enabled.
