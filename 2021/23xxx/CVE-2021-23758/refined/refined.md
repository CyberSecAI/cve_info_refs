{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the deserialization of arbitrary .NET classes within the `AjaxPro.2` package. This occurs because the application deserializes untrusted data without properly validating it, allowing an attacker to control the execution flow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector is through the network. The vulnerable component is exposed on the network, allowing attackers to exploit it remotely, potentially over the internet."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any prior privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability."
