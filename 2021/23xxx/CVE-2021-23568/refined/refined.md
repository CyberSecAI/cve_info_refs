Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-23568:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `extend` function in the `extend2` library performs an unsafe recursive merge, which allows for prototype pollution. This is due to the function not properly handling the `__proto__` property during the merging process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject properties into the `Object.prototype` by crafting a malicious JSON object with a `__proto__` property, which is then merged using the vulnerable `extend` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the `Object.prototype` with unexpected values, attackers can cause JavaScript exceptions, leading to application crashes and DoS. For example, modifying `Object.prototype.toString` to an integer would cause errors if the code relies on string conversion.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In some cases where the application uses eval on an attribute of an object, if the attacker pollutes that attribute via prototype pollution, they may be able to achieve RCE.
*   **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject or modify properties that the application relies on for informative value, including security properties like cookies or tokens, leading to privilege escalation or other security bypasses.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector involves providing a malicious JSON payload with a `__proto__` property to the vulnerable `extend` function.
*   The vulnerability is triggered during the recursive merge process of the `extend` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be able to provide or influence the input to the vulnerable `extend` function.
*   No special privileges are required. The attacker does not need to be authorized prior to attack.
*   User interaction is not required to exploit this vulnerability

**Additional Information:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability is to avoid copying the `__proto__` property during the merging process within the `extend` function. This can be achieved by adding a check to skip the `__proto__` property as shown in the commit.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions of `extend2` prior to 1.0.1.
* The vulnerability exists due to unsafe recursive merge.
* The vulnerable code is located in the index.js file of the library, specifically in the `extend` function.

**Relevant commit:**

*  The commit `aa332a59116c8398976434b57ea477c6823054f8` addresses this issue by adding a check to skip the `__proto__` property, thus preventing the prototype pollution.

**Fix:**
The fix for this issue is to upgrade `extend2` to version 1.0.1 or higher.
