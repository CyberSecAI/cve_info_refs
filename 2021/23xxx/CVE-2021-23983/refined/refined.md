  "CVE-2021-23983": {
    "Description": "By causing a transition on a parent node by removing a CSS rule, an invalid property for a marker could have been applied, resulting in memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.",
    "Root cause": "A transition on a parent node was triggered by removing a CSS rule, which could then apply an invalid property to a marker, leading to a memory corruption.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of CSS transitions with invalid properties",
      "Memory corruption due to out-of-bounds access"
    ],
    "Impact": "Memory corruption, potentially leading to an exploitable crash.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "A malicious webpage could trigger a CSS transition involving an invalid property on a ::marker element."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a webpage with specific CSS rules and transitions.",
        "Additional Details": "The vulnerability is triggered by a CSS transition on a parent node that results in the application of invalid properties on a ::marker pseudo-element, leading to an out-of-bounds read when accessing a property set. The specific invalid property being transitioned on was 'text-underline-offset', which although inheritable, is invalid on markers. The root cause was determined to be due to creating a transition with an empty effect leading to the vulnerability. The value used as an index for the out-of-bounds read was not controllable."
