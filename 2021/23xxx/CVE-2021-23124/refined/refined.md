- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of escaping in the `aria-label` attribute of the `mod_breadcrumbs` module.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the `aria-label` attribute, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of the user's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker could inject the malicious code through input that populates the breadcrumb module, which then becomes part of the `aria-label` attribute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to control the input data that is used to generate the breadcrumb navigation items.
