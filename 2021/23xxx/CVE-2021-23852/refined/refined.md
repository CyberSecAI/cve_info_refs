- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An authenticated attacker with administrator rights can call a specific URL with an invalid parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of an invalid URL parameter leading to uncontrolled resource consumption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The camera becomes unresponsive for a few seconds, causing a temporary Denial of Service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted URL with an invalid parameter to the camera via its web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated with administrator privileges on the affected Bosch IP camera.
