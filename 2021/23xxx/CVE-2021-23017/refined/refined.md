    "CVE": "CVE-2021-23017",
    "description": "A vulnerability exists in the NGINX resolver. A 1-byte memory overwrite can occur during DNS server response processing if the resolver directive is used, allowing an attacker to cause a worker process crash or arbitrary code execution via a specially crafted DNS response.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Oracle Communications Control Plane Monitor",
      "Oracle Communications Fraud Monitor",
	  "Oracle Communications Operations Monitor",

       "Oracle Communications Cloud Native Core Network Exposure Function",
	  "Oracle Communications Cloud Native Core Network Function Cloud Native Environment"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is an off-by-one error in the ngx_resolver_copy() function, which can occur when processing DNS server responses if the resolver directive is used in the NGINX configuration. This memory overwrite allows an attacker to cause a worker process crash or potentially arbitrary code execution via specially crafted DNS response.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "1-byte memory overwrite",
      "Off-by-one error"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful attack can cause worker process crashes, potentially leading to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network",
      "Forged UDP packets from a DNS server"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to forge UDP packets from a DNS server, and the target NGINX instance needs to have the 'resolver' directive used in its configuration.",
