Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The `record-like-deep-assign` package is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to its unsafe recursive merge functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unsafe Recursive Merge:** The package's deep assignment logic recursively merges properties from source objects into a target object. It doesn't properly handle the `__proto__` property, allowing an attacker to modify the prototype of `Object`.
*   **Prototype Pollution:** By injecting a `__proto__` property with malicious values into the source object, an attacker can modify the `Object.prototype`. This affects all JavaScript objects, potentially leading to various exploits.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting properties used by built-in functions such as `toString` or `valueOf`, an attacker can cause JavaScript exceptions leading to a DoS condition.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In cases where the code evaluates properties of an object (e.g., `eval(someobject.someattr)`), the attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code by polluting the prototype.
*  **Property Injection**:  The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens to gain privileges or alter intended behaviour.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker can supply a crafted JSON object containing a `__proto__` property that overwrites attributes on the `Object.prototype` via the `record-like-deep-assign` library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `record-like-deep-assign` function, specifically the source object being merged.
*   No user interaction or special privileges are required.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided text includes a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is classified as having a "high" severity by Snyk with a CVSS score of 7.3, and "critical" with a 9.8 by NVD.
*   The text lists the following prevention methods:
    *   Freezing the prototype (`Object.freeze(Object.prototype)`).
    *   Schema validation of JSON input.
    *   Avoiding unsafe recursive merge functions.
    *   Using objects without prototypes (`Object.create(null)`).
    *   Using `Map` instead of `Object`
