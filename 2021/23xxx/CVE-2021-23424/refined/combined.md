| Posting here as unable to contact maintainer. Doyensec Vulnerability Advisory  * Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in ansi-html * Affected Product: ansi-html <= 0.0.7 * Vendor: <https://github.com/Tjatse> * Severity: Low * Vulnerability Class: Denial of Service * Status: Open * Author(s): Ben Caller (Doyensec)  SUMMARY The npm package ansi-html uses a regular expression which is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). If an attacker provides a malicious string, ansi-html will get stuck processing the input for an extremely long time. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION The vulnerable regular expression is  ``` \033\[(\d+)*m  ```     [ansi-html/index.js](https://github.com/Tjatse/ansi-html/blob/99ec49e431c70af6275b3c4e00c7be34be51753c/index.js#L62)  Line 62 in [99ec49e](/Tjatse/ansi-html/commit/99ec49e431c70af6275b3c4e00c7be34be51753c)   |  | var ret = text.replace(/\033\[(\d+)\*m/g, function (match, seq) { | | --- | --- |      Due to the `(\d+)*` part, this regular expression has catastrophic backtracking when given a long string of digits.  The behaviour occurs as long as the digits are not followed immediately by an 'm'.  The complexity is exponential: increasing the length of the malicious string by one makes processing take about twice as long. REPRODUCTION STEPS In nodejs, run:  ``` require('ansi-html')('\x1b[0m\x1b[' + '0'.repeat(35)) ```  Notice that node hangs at 100% CPU. Increasing the number of spaces increases the processing time.  On my laptop that would take three minutes to complete, whereas  ``` require('ansi-html')('\x1b[0m\x1b[' + '0'.repeat(53)) ```  would take just over **one year** to complete. REMEDIATION Remove the asterisk from the regular expression on line 62.  =  Doyensec ([www.doyensec.com](http://www.doyensec.com)) is an independent security research and development company focused on vulnerability discovery and remediation.

However, when I run `yarn audit` after making these changes, I receive this error:  ``` An unexpected error occurred: "Unexpected audit response (Missing Metadata): false".  ```  The project compiles and running this command `cat node_modules/ansi-html/package.json` gives the expected output of ansi-html being inferred as ansi-html-community. But, yarn audit fails with a 400 error response from npm.  Anyone facing this issue? Any solutions? |

I first tried adding the fix to `frontend/package.json`, but, while this produced no errors, `cat frontend/node_modules/ansi-html/package.json` still showed version `0.0.7`. So I tried adding the fix to the root `package.json`, but after I did `rm -rf node_modules frontend/node_modules backend/node_modules ; yarn` I got:  ``` ‚ûú  locust-self-service git:(fix-cve-2021-23424) ‚úó rm -rf node_modules frontend/node_modules backend/node_modules ; yarn ; cat frontend/node_modules/ansi-html/package.json ‚û§ YN0000: ‚îå Project validation ‚û§ YN0057: ‚îÇ frontend: Resolutions field will be ignored ‚û§ YN0000: ‚îî Completed ‚û§ YN0000: ‚îå Resolution step ‚û§ YN0001: ‚îÇ Error: ansi-html@https://registry.yarnpkg.com/ansi-html-community/-/ansi-html-community-0.0.8.tgz#69fbc4d6ccbe383f9736934ae34c3f8290f1bf41 isn't supported by any available resolver     at Xc.getResolverByDescriptor (/Users/cpete0624/work/locust-self-service/.yarn/releases/yarn-3.0.2.cjs:294:5330)     at Xc.bindDescriptor (/Users/cpete0624/work/locust-self-service/.yarn/releases/yarn-3.0.2.cjs:294:4719)     at reduceDependency (/Users/cpete0624/work/locust-self-service/.yarn/releases/yarn-3.0.2.cjs:294:3379)     at co.reduceHook (/Users/cpete0624/work/locust-self-service/.yarn/releases/yarn-3.0.2.cjs:295:3206)     at p (/Users/cpete0624/work/locust-self-service/.yarn/releases/yarn-3.0.2.cjs:303:6768)     at async Promise.all (index 65) ‚û§ YN0000: ‚îî Completed ‚û§ YN0000: Failed with errors in 0s 192ms  ``` |

| If you are using yarn and `ansi-html` is only a *transitive* dependency, you shouldn't need to install it yourself. Just using  ``` "resolutions": {   "ansi-html": "https://registry.yarnpkg.com/ansi-html-community/-/ansi-html-community-0.0.8.tgz", }  ```  should be enough. |

Override ansi-html with ansi-html-community in package.json     `"overrides": { "ansi-html": "https://registry.yarnpkg.com/ansi-html-community/-/ansi-html-community-0.0.8.tgz" },` 2. Delete your package-lock.json and node modules folder 3. npm install    `npm i` |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## How to fix?

Upgrade `ansi-html` to version 0.0.9 or higher.

## Overview

[ansi-html](https://www.npmjs.org/package/ansi-html) is an An elegant lib that converts the chalked (ANSI) text to HTML.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). If an attacker provides a malicious string, it will get stuck processing the input for an extremely long time.

### PoC

```
require('ansi-html')('x1b[0mx1b[' + '0'.repeat(35))

```
## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.

The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.

Let‚Äôs take the following regular expression as an example:

```
regex = /A(B|C+)+D/

```

This regular expression accomplishes the following:

* `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'
* `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
* `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'

The expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`

It most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:

```
$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test("ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD")'
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test("ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX")'
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total

```

The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.

Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn‚Äôt match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as *catastrophic backtracking*.

Let's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: "ACCCX". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:

1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.

The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.

From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.

| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACCCX | 3 | 38 |
| ACCCCX | 4 | 71 |
| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136 |
| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553 |

By the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed ‚Äúremotely exploitable‚Äù and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

| I'll wait a bit on this one.  Given that our use case directly consumes errors from Webpack's stats, the risk of hitting a ReDoS is low. I do notice that `ansi-html` is not really maintained anymore, so we might swap to other alternatives/do something ourselves instead in the long run. |

This is the same fix that was implemented for [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/releases/tag/v4.1.1).

| [@pmmmwh](https://github.com/pmmmwh) Thank you for your answer. Since webpack-dev-server have patched it with the same community library, I guess we could try to rely on it too: <https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/releases/tag/v4.1.1>. It could be considered a temporary fix though. |

| Posting here as unable to contact maintainer. Doyensec Vulnerability Advisory  * Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in ansi-html * Affected Product: ansi-html <= 0.0.7 * Vendor: <https://github.com/Tjatse> * Severity: Low * Vulnerability Class: Denial of Service * Status: Open * Author(s): Ben Caller (Doyensec)  SUMMARY The npm package ansi-html uses a regular expression which is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). If an attacker provides a malicious string, ansi-html will get stuck processing the input for an extremely long time. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION The vulnerable regular expression is  ``` \033\[(\d+)*m  ```     [ansi-html/index.js](https://github.com/Tjatse/ansi-html/blob/99ec49e431c70af6275b3c4e00c7be34be51753c/index.js#L62)  Line 62 in [99ec49e](/Tjatse/ansi-html/commit/99ec49e431c70af6275b3c4e00c7be34be51753c)   |  | var ret = text.replace(/\033\[(\d+)\*m/g, function (match, seq) { | | --- | --- |      Due to the `(\d+)*` part, this regular expression has catastrophic backtracking when given a long string of digits.  The behaviour occurs as long as the digits are not followed immediately by an 'm'.  The complexity is exponential: increasing the length of the malicious string by one makes processing take about twice as long. REPRODUCTION STEPS In nodejs, run:  ``` require('ansi-html')('\x1b[0m\x1b[' + '0'.repeat(35)) ```  Notice that node hangs at 100% CPU. Increasing the number of spaces increases the processing time.  On my laptop that would take three minutes to complete, whereas  ``` require('ansi-html')('\x1b[0m\x1b[' + '0'.repeat(53)) ```  would take just over **one year** to complete. REMEDIATION Remove the asterisk from the regular expression on line 62.  =  Doyensec ([www.doyensec.com](http://www.doyensec.com)) is an independent security research and development company focused on vulnerability discovery and remediation.

However, when I run `yarn audit` after making these changes, I receive this error:  ``` An unexpected error occurred: "Unexpected audit response (Missing Metadata): false".  ```  The project compiles and running this command `cat node_modules/ansi-html/package.json` gives the expected output of ansi-html being inferred as ansi-html-community. But, yarn audit fails with a 400 error response from npm.  Anyone facing this issue? Any solutions? |
