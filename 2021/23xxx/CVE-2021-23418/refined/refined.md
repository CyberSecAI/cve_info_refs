Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23418:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of the `xmlrpclib.Fault` class to parse untrusted XML data without proper sanitization or protection. This makes the application susceptible to XML External Entity (XXE) injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **XXE Injection:** The application parses XML input without disabling the processing of external entities, which allows an attacker to inject malicious XML containing references to external entities.
- **Unsafe XML Parsing:** The use of `xmlrpclib.Fault` directly to process XML content from untrusted sources is the primary weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could exploit this to read local files, potentially accessing sensitive data like passwords or private user information.
- **Denial of Service:** By accessing resources that don't stop returning data, attackers could impact application availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The primary attack vector is through crafting malicious XML payloads that are processed by the vulnerable `xmlrpclib.Fault` parser.
- The vulnerability can be exploited over the network if the application exposes an XML RPC interface.
- User interaction is required for successful exploitation, likely by triggering a function that parses attacker-controlled XML data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to send XML data:** The attacker needs to be able to send data to a component of the application that parses XML using the vulnerable function.
- **Knowledge of XML:** The attacker needs to be familiar with XML and XXE attacks.

**Additional Details from the Provided Content:**

- **Patch:** The vulnerability was addressed by monkey-patching the `xmlrpclib` using `defusedxml.xmlrpc.monkey_patch()`.
- **Affected Code:** The vulnerable code was located in `glances/compat.py`.
- **Fix Commit:** The fix was introduced in commit `9d6051be4a42f692392049fdbfc85d5dfa458b32`.
- **Fix:** The fix was implemented by calling `defusedxml.xmlrpc.monkey_patch()` to protect against XXE attacks.
- **Severity:** Snyk rated the vulnerability as medium with a CVSS score of 6.3 while NVD rated it critical with a CVSS score of 9.8.
