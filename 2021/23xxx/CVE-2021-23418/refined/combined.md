| First idea, do not use the shell=True option. split the command line  ``` In [1]: from subprocess import Popen In [6]: cmd = 'cat README.rst | grep glances | wc -l > /tmp/titi.txt'  In [7]: Popen(cmd, shell=True) Out[7]: <subprocess.Popen at 0x7f8b46c8c310>  In [13]: cmd_pipe = [c.split('>')[0] for c in cmd.split('|')]  In [14]: cmd_pipe Out[14]: ['cat README.rst ', ' grep glances ', ' wc -l ']  In [15]: cmd_redir = cmd.split('>')[1]  In [16]: cmd_redir Out[16]: ' /tmp/titi.txt'  ```  and uses stdout for redirection:  ``` with open('temp.txt', 'w') as output:     server = subprocess.Popen('./server.py', stdout=output)     server.communicate()  ```  and this for pipe:  ``` output=`dmesg | grep hda` p1 = Popen(["dmesg"], stdout=PIPE) p2 = Popen(["grep", "hda"], stdin=p1.stdout, stdout=PIPE) p1.stdout.close()  # Allow p1 to receive a SIGPIPE if p2 exits. output = p2.communicate()[0]  ``` |

# XML External Entity (XXE) Injection Affecting [glances](/package/pip/glances) package, versions **[,3.2.1)**

### Severity

 Recommended 0.0medium010

CVSS assessment made by Snyk's Security Team. [Learn more](/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-GLANCES-1311807#cvss)

### Threat Intelligence

EPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.
Check out the EPSS
[documentation](https://www.first.org/epss/articles/prob_percentile_bins)

#### Introduced: 18 Jun 2021

[CVE-2021-23418  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-23418) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-611  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `Glances` to version 3.2.1 or higher.

## Overview

[Glances](https://pypi.org/project/Glances) is an A cross-platform curses-based monitoring tool

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) Injection via the use of Fault to parse untrusted XML data, which is known to be vulnerable to XML attacks.

## Details

XXE Injection is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input.
XML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing. When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.

Attacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier.

For example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element- username.

```
<xml>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
   <username>John</username>
</xml>

```

An external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML entity that would fetch the content of `/etc/passwd` and display it to the user rendered by `username`.

```
<xml>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
   <username>&xxe;</username>
</xml>

```

Other XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading to Denial of Service.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

6.3 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. For example, a successful exploit may only be possible during the installation of an application by a system administrator.

  **Required**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**
