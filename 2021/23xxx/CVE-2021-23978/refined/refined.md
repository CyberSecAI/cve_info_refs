Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2021-23978:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Memory safety bugs were present in Firefox 85, Firefox ESR 78.7 and Thunderbird 78.7. These bugs showed evidence of memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory safety bugs leading to memory corruption.
- Use-after-free, data races, integer overflows, and race conditions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Potential for arbitrary code execution.
- Memory corruption.
- Information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
- The specific attack vector is not mentioned but, given the nature of memory corruption bugs, it's likely to involve crafted web content or malicious input that triggers the vulnerable code paths within the browser or email client.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to trigger the memory corruption bugs. This could potentially be achieved through malicious websites, crafted email content, or other malicious inputs handled by the browser or Thunderbird.

**Additional notes:**
- The content specifies that the fix for this CVE is included in Firefox 86, Firefox ESR 78.8, and Thunderbird 78.8.
- The description mentions that "some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code."
