Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23326:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `exec` and `execSync` in the `load-git.ts` file of the `@graphql-tools/git-loader` package. These functions directly execute shell commands based on user-provided input without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection (CWE-77). By crafting malicious input for the `ref` and `path` parameters of the `loadFromGit` and `loadFromGitSync` functions, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands into the `git show` command.
- **Unsafe use of `exec` and `execSync`:** These functions are known to be vulnerable when processing user-controlled input, as they interpret the input as shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server or the user's machine running the vulnerable code with the privileges of the user executing the application. This can lead to a full system compromise, data breaches, or other malicious activities.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The vulnerability has low impacts on Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. While an attacker can access some restricted information, modify data, and cause performance reduction or interruptions in resource availability, there is not a direct or serious loss to the impacted component.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `ref` and `path` parameters passed to the `loadFromGit` and `loadFromGitSync` functions.
- An attacker can inject malicious commands through these parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Interaction Required:** The attacker would typically need user interaction to pass malicious parameters to the functions. However, if this function is exposed in a service this can be done remotely.
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker requires low privileges, enough to execute the vulnerable code.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by replacing `exec` and `execSync` with `execFile` and `execFileSync`, which do not interpret the input as a shell command, preventing command injection. The fix is present in version 6.2.6 of `@graphql-tools/git-loader`.

**Summary:**
CVE-2021-23326 is a command injection vulnerability in the `@graphql-tools/git-loader` package. It results from the unsafe use of `exec` and `execSync` which can lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited. The vulnerability is fixed in version 6.2.6 by switching to the safer `execFile` and `execFileSync` functions.
