## How to fix?

Upgrade `org.webjars.npm:prismjs` to version 1.23.0 or higher.

## Overview

[org.webjars.npm:prismjs](http://prismjs.com/) is a lightweight, robust, elegant syntax highlighting library.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the `prism-asciidoc`, `prism-rest`, `prism-tap` and `prism-eiffel` components.

## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.

The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.

Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:

```
regex = /A(B|C+)+D/

```

This regular expression accomplishes the following:

* `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'
* `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
* `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'

The expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`

It most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:

```
$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test("ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD")'
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test("ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX")'
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total

```

The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.

Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as *catastrophic backtracking*.

Let's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: "ACCCX". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:

1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.

The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.

From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.

| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACCCX | 3 | 38 |
| ACCCCX | 4 | 71 |
| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136 |
| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553 |

By the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

| Thank you for reporting! I'll fix them immediately.  [@yetingli](https://github.com/yetingli) How did you find the vulnerabilities? Some of the patterns in question contain backreferences (and assertions) and I don't know any existing technique for the static analysis of RE that can handle that. ~~Did you go through the patterns by hand or do you know/~~(I looked at your previous work) did you create a tool that does the analysis? |

'*100+'!'` is also an attack one, because the sub-pattern `( ?\/[a-z?]([ :]("[^"]*"|\S+))?)*` is ambiguous. So the fix for the 6th vulnerability is still incomplete (e.g., the string `'if'+'/? '*100+'!'` still works). |

Some of the patterns in question contain backreferences (and assertions) and I don't know any existing technique for the static analysis of RE that can handle that. ~~Did you go through the patterns by hand or do you know/~~(I looked at your previous work) did you create a tool that does the analysis?

| I just understood what you mean by strings like `'if'+'/? '*100+'!'`. I took them as literal strings (`"'if'+'/? '*100+'!'"`) and not a python-like expression to generate strings.  I verified and fixed the 6th vulnerability for your attack string.  Yes, I use my tool to detect ReDos vulnerabilities. After a time, I will release my tool and welcome to use it :)  I'm looking forward to it but in that case, I have a question: There are 2 more vulnerabilities in `prism-batch.js` (same file as a 6th one). They are in the regexes in [line 28](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/blob/38f42dd668a7bf388dfe0f5ed4b07aacb23b0255/components/prism-batch.js#L28) and [line 62](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/blob/38f42dd668a7bf388dfe0f5ed4b07aacb23b0255/components/prism-batch.js#L62). They are vulnerable for the same reason the regexes on line 41 you pointed out is (they all contain the sub pattern `(?: ?\/[a-z?](?:[ :](?:"[^"]*"|\S+))?)*`). Did you intentionally omit this or did your tool fail to detect this?  If your tool failed to detect this because it couldn't extract the regexes from the source code, then I can help you with this. I can modify Prism's test suite to extract all of the 2500 unique regexes Prism uses (even the dynamically generated ones) and output all of them into a JSON file (or similar) (like I did [here](https://github.com/RunDevelopment/refa/blob/f95e967409da3d77de1028d8cde2e428e4a6aa2b/tests/helper/prism-regex-data.ts#L3)). I don't want to push you to spend more time on Prism than necessary, so feel free to decline if you aren't interested.  I can help to detect whether the repaired patterns are safe.  Thank you for your continued help! All of my fixes are in [#2584](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/2584).  I can't reproduce the 3rd vulnerability. The attack string doesn't work and I just don't see ambiguity that could cause exponential backtracking.  You can make the string longer, for example, the attack string `'= '*50000` took 24763 ms.  The sub-pattern `(?:=+ +)+=+` is ambiguity, I am willing to suggest that you replace `(?:=+ +)+=+` with `=+ +=+`  This fix is equivalent, and the repaired regex is safe and efficient.  For example, for the attack string `'= '*50000`, the vulnerable regex took 24763 ms and the fixed one only took 1 ms.  I analyzed the pattern and the problem is the following:  First of all. The pattern does not backtrack exponentially. All words of the language `'= '*n` (I'm using your notation) are rejected after O(n^2) steps.  Measurments  | n | t = time to reject `'= '*n` | `t/(n*n)*1e6` (scaling for nicer numbers) | | --- | --- | --- | | 50 | 0.021ms | 8.540 | | 100 | 0.077ms | 7.724 | | 200 | 0.303ms | 7.573 | | 500 | 1.907ms | 7.628 | | 1000 | 7.622ms | 7.622 | | 2000 | 30.796ms | 7.699 | | 5000 | 193.134ms | 7.725 | | 10000 | 776.411ms | 7.764 |   Code used:  ``` const { performance } = require("perf_hooks"); const measure = (fn, samples = 1) => { 	const start = performance.now(); 	for (let i = samples; i > 0; i--) { 		fn(); 	} 	return (performance.now() - start) / samples; };  const samples = 10; const re = /(\s*)(?:=+ +)+=+(?:(?:\r?\n|\r)\1.+)+(?:\r?\n|\r)\1(?:=+ +)+=+(?=(?:\r?\n|\r){2}|\s*$)/; // warmup measure(() => re.test("= "), 100);  const measurements = []; const ns = [50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000]; for (const n of ns) { 	const text = "= ".repeat(n); 	const t = measure(() => re.test(text), samples); 	measurements.push([ 		n, 		t, 		t / n**2 * 1e6 // scaled up by a constant factor to get nicer numbers 	]); }  measurements.forEach(([n, t, r]) => { 	console.log(`| ${n} | ${t.toFixed(3)}ms | ${r.toFixed(3)} |`) }); ```  Run with Node.js v13.12.0 but previous versions will also work.  That being said, I don't think that this can actually be fixed. The problem is that each suffix of the input string takes O(n) steps to reject and it seems like the regex engine is forced to try O(n) many suffixes. Even extremely simple regexes like `/a+b/` show this O(n^2) behavior for inputs like `'a'*n`.  I also want to point out that `(?:=+ +)+=+` and `=+ +=+` do **not** accept the same language but `(?:=+ +)+=+` and `=+ [ =]*=` do. I will replace all occurrences of `(?:=+ +)+=+` with `=+ [ =]*=` for now. While `=+ [ =]*=` will still reject your attack string in O(n^2) time, it does so twice as fast as `(?:=+ +)+=+` in my tests. |

[Here](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/files/5365350/all-patterns-map.zip) is a JSON of all 2587 unique regexes. Each regex is mapped to all of its occurrences in Prism language definitions. All regexes were extracted from the most recent commit in [#2584](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/2584).  If you need/want anything else, please don't hesitate to ask. This is a huge improvement for Prism, so I'm really thankful for the work you're doing. |

| Thank you [@yetingli](https://github.com/yetingli)!  Sorry for the delay. I have looked at the files and analyzed them. Changed regexes Before I show the results, one question: Why did some regexes change? None of the regexes in your JS files had flags. I went through a few regexes and it seems like none of them actually used the flags but I still wonder. The other change I noticed is more severe: Non-capturing groups were replaced with capturing groups. This is a huge issue because this changed the groups that backreferences were pointing to. Example of a changed regex ``` From /((?:^|\r?\n|\r)([\t ]*)(?:[~-]|[&!]?=)).*,[\t ]*(?:(?:\r?\n|\r)\2[\t ]+.*,[\t ]*)*(?:(?:\r?\n|\r)\2[\t ]+.+)/ To /((^|\r?\n|\r)([\t ]*)([~-]|[&!]?=)).*,[\t ]*((\r?\n|\r)\2[\t ]+.*,[\t ]*)*((\r?\n|\r)\2[\t ]+.+)/  ```   There are no other changes that have been made to the regexes.  I also want to point out that the second change (non-capturing -> capturing) is not consistent across regexes. The second change is significantly more likely for the regexes with higher file numbers. Extraction While the script files were very nice in demonstrating the issue, they also make it hard to fix the issues because I had no idea where the regexes are coming from. The first thing I did was to extract the regex and the [x,y,z] tuple (the strings that generate the attack string `x+y*n+z`) from all scripts. I then added the location of each regex (the array of strings each regex had in the JSON I send you). Measuring I then measured the execution time of each regex on generated attack strings `x+y*n+z` to determine the runtime complexity of the regexes. This can easily be done because the runtime of a regex will either be linear, polynomial or exponential.  Note: With linear, I mean `Θ(n)`. With polynomial, I mean `Θ(n^p)` with `p>=2`.  The runtime of both the extracted regex and the original regex were measured. I also measure the runtime of an anchored version of the regex (= `/^<extracted regex>/`) to determine the whether the polynomial runtime is due to the pattern being matched against `O(n)` suffixes of the string. Results 5 regexes were changed enough to affect their runtime. This was usually due to a backreference not referring to the right group anymore.  5 regexes have exponential runtime. 4 of those, I already detect (and fixed) with my method in [#2590](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/2590). The remaining one (`Prism.languages.asciidoc.macro`) was fixed.  2 regexes have linear runtime. One attack string didn't work because a prefix of it was accepted. The other attack string didn't work because the regex had Prism lookbehind group (just a normal capturing group) that prevented polynomial runtime. Polynomial Now to the polynomial. 104 regexes have polynomial runtime. I further subdivided this into 3 categories. The main idea is that some of the polynomial runtime isn't caused by backtracking but by the regex engine moving the pattern across the string to find a match. Even if the pattern only looks at each character once to reject a suffix of the string, it has to do so for `O(n)` many times due to being moved. (Example: `a*b` for strings `"a"*n`.) This is why I also measured an anchored version of each regex.  95 regexes have `Θ(n^2)` runtime because of moving. This is the majority of all regexes.  1 regex has `Θ(n^3)` runtime because of moving and polynomial (`Θ(n^2)`) backtracking.  8 regexes have polynomial backtracking not affected by moving. Problems with your method I want to point out that your method seems to favor polynomial runtime over exponential backtracking. Some of the patterns reported as polynomial also have attack strings that can cause exponential backtracking. Examples: ``` /"(?:[^\\$"]|\\[\s\S]|\$(?:(?=")|\$+|[^"${])|\$\{(?:[^{}"]|"(?:[^\\"]|\\[\s\S])*")*\})*"/ // xyz = ['"', '$', '']  /(["'])(?:(?!\1)[^\\\r\n]|\\z(?:\r\n|\s)|\\(?:\r\n|[\s\S]))*\1|\[(=*)\[[\s\S]*?\]\2\]/ // xyz = ['"', '\\z ', ''] (JS strings, so the backslash is used to escape characters)  /("|')((?!\1|\$\{)[^\\]|\\.|\$\{([^<()"']|\(([^<()"']|\(([^<()"']|\(([^<()"']|\(([^\s\S])*\)|<(?!#--)|<#--([^-]|-(?!->))*-->|"([^\\"]|\\.)*"|'([^\\']|\\.)*')*\)|<(?!#--)|<#--([^-]|-(?!->))*-->|"([^\\"]|\\.)*"|'([^\\']|\\.)*')*\)|<(?!#--)|<#--([^-]|-(?!->))*-->|"([^\\"]|\\.)*"|'([^\\']|\\.)*')*\)|<(?!#--)|<#--([^-]|-(?!->))*-->|"([^\\"]|\\.)*"|'([^\\']|\\.)*')*?\})*\1/ // xyz = ['"', '${}', '']  ```   This is concerning because people may be inclined to ignore fixing patterns that run in "only `O(n^2)`". This may cause some exponential backtracking to never be found and fixed.  I also want to point out that your method has failed to point out a lot of other patterns with exponential backtracking. Examples: ``` /(^|[^\\](?:\\\\)*)(["'])(?:\\[\s\S]|\$\([^)]+\)|`[^`]+`|(?!\2)[^\\])*\2/ // xyz = ['"', '$( )', '']  /"(?:[^\\$"]|\\[\s\S]|\$(?:(?=")|\$+|[^"${])|\$\{(?:[^{}"]|"(?:[^\\"]|\\[\s\S])*")*\})*"/ // xyz = ['"', '$', '']  /("|')(?:#\{[^}]+\}|\\(?:\r\n|[\s\S])|(?!\1)[^\\\r\n])*\1/ // xyz = ['"', '#{ }', '']  ```   It also failed to find a lot of cases of polynomial backtracking. See [#2597](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/2597) for examples. Closing thoughts While not perfect, your method has found a lot of cases of exponential and polynomial backtracking. All cases of exponential backtracking have been fixed in [#2590](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/2590) and I plan to fix all non-moving polynomial backtracking regexes in [#2597](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/2597).  Files [Here is a JSON of the results](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/files/5436054/grouped.zip).  [Here is all the code](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/files/5436061/prismredos.zip) I used to produce these results (scripts are supposed to be executed in the order extract -> measure -> group). |

| Many thanks for your further verification and repair! [@RunDevelopment](https://github.com/RunDevelopment)  Before I show the results, one question: Why did some regexes change? Non-capturing groups were replaced with capturing groups. This is a huge issue because this changed the groups that backreferences were pointing to.  I'm very sorry, these changes have brought you great inconvenience to fix the issues. I want to explain why I have to make these changes (non-capturing -> capturing). Existing static analysis techniques cannot handle non-capturing and backreferences, etc. well. Although the existing dynamic fuzzing methods can process non-capturing and backreferences, etc., the detection is very time-consuming. Meanwhile, for dynamic methods, there will be false negatives.  So I would like to try a combination of dynamic and static methods, that is, some regexes are directly checked by static methods (preferred), and the rest are checked by dynamic fuzzing. I want to try to change the initial regex (e.g., non-capturing -> capturing) so that it can be detected by static methods as much as possible. Thank you for pointing out the problem (`This is a huge issue because this changed the groups that backreferences were pointing to`), it really cannot be replaced mechanically!  I want to point out that your method seems to favor polynomial runtime over exponential backtracking. Some of the patterns reported as polynomial also have attack strings that can cause exponential backtracking.  This may be related to the detection strategy I mentioned earlier. If I use the dynamic fuzzing method directly, there will be no such problem. It seems that I still need to make a further trade-off between detection efficiency and effect.  I also want to point out that your method has failed to point out a lot of other patterns with exponential backtracking.  On the one hand, there are false negatives as mentioned above, and on the other hand, some characters (e.g., `\xA0-\uFFFF`) or features (e.g., negative lookbehind `(?<!pattern)`) are temporarily not supported by my tool.  I really appreciate your responses :) There is no doubt that your reply is a great help to the further improvement of my tools. thank you so much again for the terrific work. |

| I'm glad that my results could be of help.  Existing static analysis techniques cannot handle non-capturing and backreferences, etc. well.  I suppose that's the reason flags disappeared as well?  Regarding the non-capturing groups. They can easily be converted to capturing ones if backreferences are also changed so that they still point to the right group.  Here is a little JS function that does exactly that. Given the source of the regex (everything between the `//`) and whether the `u` flag is active for the regex (regexes parse slightly differently with that flag), it will return the given source without non-capturing groups. I used the regexpp library for parsing.  ``` const { RegExpParser, visitRegExpAST } = require("regexpp");  /**  * @param {string} source   * @param {boolean} unicode   * @returns {string}  */ function toCapturing(source, unicode) { 	const patternAst = new RegExpParser().parsePattern(source, undefined, undefined, unicode);  	/** @type {Map<import("regexpp/ast").CapturingGroup, number>} */ 	const groupNumbers = new Map(); 	let groupCounter = 0; 	visitRegExpAST(patternAst, { 		onGroupEnter() { 			groupCounter++; 		}, 		onCapturingGroupEnter(node) { 			groupCounter++; 			groupNumbers.set(node, groupCounter); 		} 	});  	/** @type {{ start: number; end: number; text: string; }[]} */ 	const changes = []; 	visitRegExpAST(patternAst, { 		onGroupEnter(node) { 			changes.push({ 				start: node.start, 				end: node.start + "(?:".length, 				text: "(" 			}); 		}, 		onBackreferenceEnter(node) { 			changes.push({ 				start: node.start, 				end: node.end, 				text: "\\" + groupNumbers.get(node.resolved) 			}); 		} 	});  	changes.reverse(); 	for (const { start, end, text } of changes) { 		source = source.substring(0, start) + text + source.substring(end); 	}  	return source; }  // example toCapturing(/(?:)(a)\1/.source, false) // returns '()(a)\\2' ```   Flags are harder to remove.  I don't want to shamelessly promote my own work but you *could* use my library [refa](https://github.com/RunDevelopment/refa). It can parse a JS regex to get my AST format. With the AST, a modified version of refa's `JS.toLiteral` function could create a regex that is equivalent to the original regex but doesn't use any flags. I.e. `/(a|A)+(?=b)/i` will be converted to `/([Aa]|[Aa])+(?=[Bb])/`. The main limitation is that my AST format doesn't support backreferences.  If you were using existing static analyzers that only support ASCII regexes (e.g. RXXR2), then the AST could be transformed to derive an ASCII regex from any JS regex.  That being said, this is probably too much work for too little gain especially if your tool wasn't focused on JS regexes. I just wanted to point out that it is possible. |

#### Introduced: 18 Feb 2021

[CVE-2021-23341  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-23341) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-400  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses
## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `org.webjars:prismjs`.

## Overview

[org.webjars:prismjs](http://prismjs.com/) is a lightweight, robust, elegant syntax highlighting library.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the `prism-asciidoc`, `prism-rest`, `prism-tap` and `prism-eiffel` components.

## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.

The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.

Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:

```
regex = /A(B|C+)+D/

```

This regular expression accomplishes the following:

* `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'
* `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
* `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'

The expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`

It most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:

```
$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test("ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD")'
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test("ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX")'
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total

```

The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.

Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as *catastrophic backtracking*.

Let's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: "ACCCX". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:

1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.

The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.

From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.

| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACCCX | 3 | 38 |
| ACCCCX | 4 | 71 |
| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136 |
| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553 |

By the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

| I'm still analyzing [the results](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/issues/2583#issuecomment-710030539) I got from [@yetingli](https://github.com/yetingli), so a few more regexes might have to be changed. I'll merge this once I'm done.  but all of the tests pass  Yeah. Most of the changes don't change the language the regex matches. |
