Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-23980:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a combination of factors related to how `bleach.clean` processes specific tags and comments when the `strip_comments` argument is set to `False`. Specifically, it involves the interaction of `svg` or `math` tags, `p` or `br` tags, and certain "eject tags" (`style`, `title`, `noscript`, `script`, `textarea`, `noframes`, `iframe`, or `xmp`) with HTML comments. The core issue is that the parser doesn't consistently treat the end tag of `<p>` or `<br>` as a namespace breaker within `math` or `svg`, which leads to incorrect processing of subsequent tags. When the resulting output is later parsed by a browser, it can result in the execution of injected scripts due to unexpected tag nesting and comment handling.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Mutation XSS:** The vulnerability allows for a mutation cross-site scripting (mXSS) attack. The output of bleach is modified by browser parsing in a way that malicious script can be executed.
- **Incorrect Namespace Handling:** The `bleach` library improperly handles tag namespaces (`math` and `svg`), particularly with respect to closing tags (`</p>` and `<br>`) and how they interact with comments and the subsequent "eject tags".
- **Inconsistent Parsing:** The library's parsing behavior is inconsistent between initial processing and how the resulting output is parsed by a browser leading to different tag structures and interpretations.
- **Comment Stripping Bypass:** When `strip_comments=False` is used, the library fails to prevent comment tags from being used as a way to inject HTML code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the application using the `bleach` library. This can allow an attacker to:
- Steal user session cookies.
- Redirect users to malicious websites.
- Modify content on the page.
- Perform other actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious HTML code that includes `<math>` or `<svg>` tags, `<p>` or `<br>` tags, comment delimiters, and "eject tags" such as `<style>` and `<script>`.
- The injected HTML is processed by `bleach.clean` with `strip_comments=False` and the necessary tags allowed.
- The output of `bleach.clean` is then rendered in a web browser. The browser reparses the output, causing the mutation that triggers the XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to submit or inject HTML content that will be processed by the vulnerable `bleach.clean` function.
- The attacker also needs to know or be able to determine that the application is using `bleach.clean` with the specific vulnerable configuration: allowing `math`/`svg`, allowing `p`/`br`, allowing "eject tags", and `strip_comments=False`.
- No special privileges required, just the ability to inject the specific HTML payload.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when using non-default configurations of `bleach.clean()`.
- A strong Content Security Policy (CSP) can help mitigate the risk.
- The fix involves escaping HTML comments by default.
