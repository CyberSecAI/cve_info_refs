Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23507:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a prototype pollution issue arising from an incomplete fix in the `object-path-set` library's `setPath` method. The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `setPath` method did not properly sanitize or validate the input path, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the object's prototype. This was possible due to the use of bracket notation for property access, which coerces keys to strings, allowing an array representation of a property path to bypass string checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core issue is the ability to modify the `Object.prototype` by injecting properties using the `setPath` method.
*   **Incomplete Fix:** The initial attempt to fix a previous prototype pollution vulnerability was insufficient, specifically by checking string representations of the path components, which could be bypassed by providing an array of string representations of the path components.
*   **Type Confusion:** The vulnerability exploits type confusion in JavaScript where an array value can bypass string checks and validation. This occurs because the `===` operator returns `false` if the operands are different types and bracket notation for property access coerces keys to strings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By modifying properties like `toString` or `valueOf` on `Object.prototype`, an attacker can cause JavaScript exceptions, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject properties that the application relies on for security, like isAdmin flags or tokens, potentially granting elevated privileges.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In scenarios where the application evaluates object properties (e.g., using `eval`), prototype pollution can be leveraged to execute malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **`setPath` method:** The primary attack vector is through the vulnerable `setPath` function of the `object-path-set` library.
*   **Manipulating Path:** The attacker needs to control the path argument of `setPath` in order to set the property on the `__proto__`.
*   **Bypassing String Checks:** The attacker needs to provide an array representation of the path to bypass string checks in the vulnerable code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control over Path Input:** The attacker must be able to control the `path` parameter of the `setPath` function.
*   **Ability to call the vulnerable function:** The attacker needs to have a way to call the vulnerable `setPath` function, either through a direct call or an indirect call via a component using this library.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is a bypass of a previous fix.
*   The fix involves converting path components to strings before checking them for unsafe properties.
*   The vulnerability can lead to denial of service, remote code execution, or property injection.
*   The vulnerable versions are < 1.0.2 of the `object-path-set` package.
*   Snyk assigned the ID **SNYK-JS-OBJECTPATHSET-2388576** to this vulnerability.
*   The Snyk blog post highlights other related vulnerabilities found due to type confusion.

**Summary**

CVE-2021-23507 is a prototype pollution vulnerability in the `object-path-set` library where a type confusion vulnerability can be leveraged to bypass previous security fixes. Attackers can exploit the `setPath` method by providing an array as the path argument to pollute object prototypes leading to potential DoS, RCE or privilege escalation.
