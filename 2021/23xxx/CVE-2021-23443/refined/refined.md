Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23443:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a type confusion issue within the `edge.js` templating engine. Specifically, when an array is provided as input to be rendered, the input sanitization is bypassed. This occurs because the escaping mechanism expects either a string or a `SafeValue` object, and doesn't properly handle arrays.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS. The type confusion allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the rendered output.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize input when it's an array, leading to the bypass.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** By injecting malicious scripts, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** XSS can be used to steal cookies and hijack user sessions.
- **Data Exposure:** Sensitive information can be exposed.
- **Access to Privileged Services:**  Attackers may gain access to privileged services.
- **Malware Delivery:** XSS can be used to deliver malware.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates a reflected XSS where the malicious payload is included as input to the templating engine, which is then reflected back to the user's browser.
- The malicious payload is injected into the template via the `greeting` parameter, which is then not properly sanitized if provided as an array.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input that is passed to the `edge.js` template rendering engine.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious JavaScript payload.
- User interaction is required, as the user needs to visit a page or application that includes the vulnerable code.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided github commit ([https://github.com/edge-js/edge/commit/fa2c7fde86327aeae232752e89a6e37e2e469e21](https://github.com/edge-js/edge/commit/fa2c7fde86327aeae232752e89a6e37e2e469e21)) shows the fix which modifies the `escape` function to properly handle arrays and stringify them before escaping.
- The vulnerability affects versions of `edge.js` prior to 5.3.2.
- Snyk assigned a CVSS score of 5.4 (Medium) and NVD assigned a score of 6.1 (Medium).

The vulnerability can be mitigated by upgrading `edge.js` to version 5.3.2 or higher, where the fix for this issue is included.
