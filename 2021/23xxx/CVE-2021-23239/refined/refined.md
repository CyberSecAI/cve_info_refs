Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2021-23239:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A race condition in the `sudoedit` functionality within the Sudo application when creating new files. Specifically, the code checks the parent directory's existence and type using `stat()`. A non-privileged user can exploit this by creating a symlink in a writable directory at the parent path after the initial file existence check but before the `stat()` call, which bypasses the intended restriction.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Race Condition:** The vulnerability stems from the time gap between the initial file existence check and the subsequent check with `stat()`.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Allows a local unprivileged user to perform arbitrary directory-existence tests based on `sudoedit` behavior.
*  **Inadequate Path Validation:** `sudoedit` permits the editing of files in a directory controlled by a non-privileged user when the target file does not exist yet. It checks for symlinks in directories, but the check is susceptible to a race condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is **information disclosure**. An unprivileged user can determine the existence of directories they would not normally have access to. While the attacker can use a symlink in a location where a file will be created to trigger the vulnerability, they cannot write to arbitrary locations using this vulnerability, because the file creation happens with `O_CREAT` which does not follow symlinks.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have access to the affected machine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a local, unprivileged user on the system.
*   They need to have the ability to win a race condition to create a symlink in a directory they control that is a parent directory in a path that root will write to.
*   They must have `sudoedit` privileges to edit a file as root using a target path that doesn't yet exist.

**Additional notes from the content:**

*   The vulnerability was present in multiple versions of sudo prior to 1.9.5.
*   Fixes involve modifying the behavior of `sudo_edit_open()` to not follow symlinks.
*   Several vendors like Fedora, Debian, SUSE, and NetApp have acknowledged and patched the vulnerability in their products.
*   The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2021-23239 with a CVSS v3.1 score of 2.5 (LOW).
