- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The login routine allows authentication using the password hash instead of the actual password. This is further compounded by a separate vulnerability (CVE-2021-23858) that exposes password hashes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Use of password hash instead of password for authentication (CWE-836)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass the standard login process and gain unauthorized access to the system by using a known password hash, which can be obtained from another vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks, exploiting the web server of the affected devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to reach the webserver on the affected device and needs to have obtained the password hash through the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-23858.
