Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23407:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-controlled file names within the `elFinder.Net.Core` package. Specifically, when renaming files, the application does not properly validate the provided name, allowing directory traversal sequences (e.g., "../").

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal (CWE-22):** The core weakness is the ability to navigate outside of the intended file storage directory by injecting "../" sequences into the file name during a rename operation.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The application fails to sanitize user input before using it to construct file paths, which enables the traversal vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can write files to locations outside of the designated directory, potentially overwriting existing files. This is often referred to as a 'Zip-Slip' vulnerability when exploiting via archive extraction.
*  **Information Disclosure:** While not the focus of the provided information, the description does note that directory traversal can lead to information disclosure, where an attacker could read sensitive files from the system if they have the ability to traverse to them.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** If an attacker can overwrite critical configuration or executable files with malicious content, this could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via network requests to the application's web interface.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must rename a file using the applicationâ€™s UI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
*   **Application UI Access:** The attacker needs access to the application's file management interface to initiate the rename operation.
*   **Basic Understanding of File Systems:** Knowledge of directory structures and traversal techniques (like using "../") is needed.

**Technical Details:**

* The provided code diffs show how the issue was addressed. Primarily, the changes focus on using `PathHelper.SafelyCombine` instead of `Path.Combine` and adding checks for `InvalidFileNameException` and `InvalidDirNameException`.
*   The Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability by renaming a file using "../" to place the file outside of the intended directory.
* The changes within the file `elFinder.Net.Core/Connector.cs` indicate an additional check of path for `putCmd` where `putCmd.Encoding == "hash"`.
*   The changes include the addition of `InvalidDirNameException` and `InvalidFileNameException` exceptions, and new checks for these.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of `elFinder.Net.Core` prior to `1.2.4`.
*   The vulnerability is rated as high severity.
*  The Snyk information provides a CVSS v3.1 score of 7.5, which is considered high.

The provided information gives a clear understanding of the directory traversal vulnerability in `elFinder.Net.Core`, its exploitation, and the fix implemented in version 1.2.4
