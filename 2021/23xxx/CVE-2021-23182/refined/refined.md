- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cleartext storage of sensitive information in memory. Specifically, OSDP reader master keys are stored in cleartext in the memory of the Gallagher Command Centre Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Sensitive information (OSDP reader master keys) are stored in cleartext in memory, making them discoverable in server memory dumps.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker who obtains a memory dump of the Command Centre Server could potentially extract the OSDP reader master keys, which could then be used for further malicious activities such as unauthorized access. This could lead to high impact on confidentiality and integrity.
- **Attack vectors:**  An attacker would need to obtain a memory dump of the affected Command Centre Server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs privileged access (High PR) to obtain the memory dump.
