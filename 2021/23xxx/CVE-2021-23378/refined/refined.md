- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `picotts` package uses the `child_process.exec` function without sanitizing user-controlled input passed to the `say` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary command injection vulnerability exists due to the lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system running the vulnerable application. This could lead to full compromise of the system, including loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `say` function of the `picotts` package. The attacker needs to be able to control the input provided to this function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `say` function. This could happen remotely if the application is exposed to network, or locally if the attacker has access to influence the input of the application. No privileges or user interaction is required.
