Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23957:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Firefox for Android handled `intent` URL schemes within sandboxed iframes. Specifically, it allowed an iframe, even with the "allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" sandbox attribute, to initiate a navigation to another app (e.g., Chrome) using an `intent` URL without requiring user interaction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Iframe Sandbox Bypass:** The primary weakness was the ability to bypass the intended restrictions of the iframe sandbox. The "allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" attribute should have prevented top-level navigations without user interaction, but this was circumvented by using `intent` URLs.
- **Lack of User Interaction Enforcement:** The browser failed to enforce user interaction before launching the intent URL, allowing a malicious iframe to force redirects to other applications.
- **Android Intent Handling:** The Android-specific `intent` URL scheme was not correctly handled within the context of a sandboxed iframe, leading to the bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Forced Redirection:** An attacker could force a user to be redirected to a malicious page in another application (like Chrome). This bypass could occur without user interaction.
- **Malvertising Campaign:** The vulnerability was actively exploited by malvertisers to force redirections, indicating that this exploit was used in the wild for financial gain.
- **Exposure to Malicious Content:** Users could be exposed to unwanted or malicious content by this vulnerability

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious iframe:** An attacker could inject a malicious iframe into a website.
- **Intent URL Scheme:** The attacker would use a crafted `intent` URL within the iframeâ€™s JavaScript code to trigger the unwanted redirect.
  Example: `location.href = "intent://malicious_landing_page/#Intent;scheme=https;package=com.android.chrome;end";`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Injection Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to inject a malicious iframe into a website or serve a webpage containing the malicious iframe. This could happen through malicious ads.
- **JavaScript Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript within the malicious iframe.
- **Targeted Firefox on Android Users:** The attack is specific to Firefox on Android.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was actively exploited in a real-world malvertising campaign.
- The issue was fixed by preventing the handling of intent URLs within subframe requests in the `AppLinksInterceptor` of Android Components (AC).
- The fix was included in AC version 70.
- The fix was included in Firefox 85 and later versions but not backported to Firefox ESR 68.

The vulnerability is rated as "moderate" impact, likely because it was limited to Android.
