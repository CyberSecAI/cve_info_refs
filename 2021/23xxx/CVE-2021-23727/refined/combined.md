Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-1dae017601
2022-01-16 01:17:23.607899
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : python-celery
Product : Fedora 35
Version : 5.2.3
Release : 2.fc35
URL : <https://celeryproject.org>
Summary : Distributed Task Queue
Description :
An open source asynchronous task queue/job queue based on
distributed message passing. It is focused on real-time
operation, but supports scheduling as well.

The execution units, called tasks, are executed concurrently
on one or more worker nodes using multiprocessing, Eventlet
or gevent. Tasks can execute asynchronously (in the background)
or synchronously (wait until ready).

Celery is used in production systems to process millions of
tasks a day.

Celery is written in Python, but the protocol can be implemented
in any language. It can also operate with other languages using
web hooks.

The recommended message broker is RabbitMQ, but limited support
for Redis, Beanstalk, MongoDB, CouchDB and databases
(using SQLAlchemy or the Django ORM) is also available.

#### Introduced: 9 Dec 2021

[CVE-2021-23727  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-23727) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-78  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `celery` to version 5.2.2 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Stored Command Injection. It by default trusts the messages and metadata stored in backends (result stores). When reading task metadata from the backend, the data is deserialized. Given that an attacker can gain access to, or somehow manipulate the metadata within a celery backend, they could trigger a stored command injection vulnerability and potentially gain further access to the system.

### PoC

Example of modified metadata as stored in the result stores:

```
'status': 'FAILURE',
'result': json.dumps({
  'exc_module': 'os',
  'exc_type': 'system',
  'exc_message': 'id'
  })
}

```

Reproduction steps in a Python shell:

```
from celery.backends.base import Backend
from celery import Celery
b = Backend(Celery())
exc = {'exc_module':'os',  'exc_type':'system', 'exc_message':'id'}
b.exception_to_python(exc)

```

The result would be an output of `os.system('id')`.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

6.6 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker requires privileges that provide significant (e.g., administrative) control over the vulnerable component allowing access to component-wide settings and files.

  **High**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).
