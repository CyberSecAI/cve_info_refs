- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Exposure of sensitive OSDP key material to unauthorized Command Centre operators.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive OSDP key material which could be used to compromise OSDP readers and potentially gain unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the Command Centre server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to have valid Command Centre operator credentials (i.e. be a logged-in user) to exploit the vulnerability.
