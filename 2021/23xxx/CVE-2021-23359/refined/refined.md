- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `port-killer` package uses the `child_process.exec` function without proper sanitization of user-provided input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary command injection vulnerability due to unsanitized input passed to `child_process.exec`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system where the vulnerable package is used. In the provided PoC, this leads to the creation of a file (`touch success`). However, the impact could be much more severe, including data exfiltration, system compromise, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through user-controlled input that is passed to the vulnerable `port-killer` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to control the input that is passed to the `port-killer` function. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the vulnerable system, just the ability to provide input to the vulnerable function.
