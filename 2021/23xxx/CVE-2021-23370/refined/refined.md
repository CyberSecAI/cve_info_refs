Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23370:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a Prototype Pollution issue stemming from the way the `swiper` library handles object merging. Specifically, the `extendDefaults` function in `swiper` is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to an unsafe recursive merge. When merging objects, it doesn't properly sanitize or check for the presence of `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype` properties in the source object, which allows an attacker to inject properties onto the `Object.prototype`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsafe Recursive Merge:** The `extendDefaults` function in the `swiper` library uses a recursive merge process without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject properties into the `Object.prototype`.
*   **Prototype Pollution:** The ability to modify the `Object.prototype` through the vulnerable merge function, which allows an attacker to add or modify properties that are then inherited by all JavaScript objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting properties used by the codebase, such as `toString` or `valueOf`, an attacker can cause JavaScript exceptions, leading to denial of service.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the codebase evaluates an attribute of a polluted object, and then executes it (e.g., using `eval`), the attacker can achieve remote code execution.
*   **Property Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary properties into the `Object.prototype`, potentially leading to privilege escalation or other unexpected behavior based on how the application uses object properties. For instance, an attacker could inject an `isAdmin` property, which, if not checked appropriately, could lead to the attacker gaining administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the `extendDefaults` function of the `swiper` library. By providing a malicious JSON payload that contains a `__proto__` property, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
*   This can occur when the application uses the `swiper` library and incorporates user-controlled data in the `extendDefaults` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to control the input that is being passed into the vulnerable `extendDefaults` function of the `swiper` library. This usually requires the attacker to have some control over data, often in JSON format, that is used to configure the library.
*   The attacker does not need any privileges on the system to exploit the vulnerability.
*   No user interaction is required for the exploitation.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of the `swiper` package before 6.5.1 (for npm) and before 6.5.7 (for org.webjars.npm:swiper).
*   The vulnerability can be exploited through network-based attacks (remotely exploitable).

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade the `swiper` library to version 6.5.1 or higher (for npm package), or 6.5.7 or higher (for org.webjars.npm:swiper) or 10.2.0 or higher (for `org.webjars.bowergithub.nolimits4web:swiper`).
*   Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions and sanitize input.
*   Consider using objects without prototypes (e.g., `Object.create(null)`) to prevent prototype pollution.
*   Use `Map` instead of `Object` where feasible to avoid prototype inheritance issues.
*  Freeze the prototype using `Object.freeze(Object.prototype)`.
*  Implement schema validation of JSON input.
