- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of restrictions on the types of files that can be uploaded. Specifically, the `maps_srv.js` component allows the upload of a malicious NodeJS file via the `uploadBackgroud` action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted File Upload (CWE-434). The system fails to validate the file type being uploaded, allowing an attacker to upload a file with a dangerous type such as a malicious NodeJS file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload malicious code or execute arbitrary commands on the system where IPM is installed. This can lead to complete control over the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker sends a specially crafted packet to the IPM software to initiate the file upload via the `uploadBackgroud` action in `maps_srv.js`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the IPM software to exploit this vulnerability.
