Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-23969:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect handling of redirects when generating Content Security Policy (CSP) violation reports. Specifically, when a CSP violation occurred due to a blocked resource loaded after a redirect, the violation report incorrectly included the *destination* URL of the redirect instead of the *origin* or the *pre-redirect* URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The primary weakness is that the full redirect URL, which might contain sensitive information (such as authentication tokens, session IDs, or user-specific paths), could be exposed in the CSP violation report.
*   **CSP Bypass:** While not a direct bypass of CSP, the vulnerability undermines the privacy guarantees CSP intends to provide. The ability to observe redirect destinations can be used to map internal application structure.
*   **Incorrect URL Handling:** The vulnerability arises from incorrect processing of URLs during redirects when creating the violation report. The user agent should use the pre-redirect URL, or strip to the origin as specified in the W3C CSP spec.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Attackers can potentially obtain sensitive information embedded in redirect URLs, including OAuth tokens or session IDs.
*   **Cross-Origin Information Leakage:** By injecting content into iframes, the attacker may be able to trick a website into exposing information from redirects that are blocked by CSP, but still reported.
*   **Reduced Privacy:** The vulnerability can leak information about which services a user prefers and can reveal parts of a web application's structure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Client-Side Navigation:** The vulnerability is triggered when a client-side script (e.g., JavaScript) initiates a navigation that results in a CSP violation.
*   **Redirects:** The attacker needs to cause a redirect to occur that will violate the CSP.
*   **Iframes:** The attacks require injection of content into an iframe.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Inject or Control Content:** The attacker needs to be able to either inject malicious content into a website or control a website in a way that it causes a redirect to a resource blocked by the CSP.
*  **Knowledge of Target Site:** The attacker needs to know what domain is targeted to create specific redirects to cause a CSP violation and receive the report.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Firefox, Firefox ESR, and Thunderbird, as confirmed by multiple sources.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the CSP violation report contains the origin of the resource being loaded or the pre-redirect URL and not the destination of the redirect.
*   The vulnerability has a high impact because of the potential for leaking sensitive information.

The fix for this issue is to use the requested URL before any redirects occurred or to strip the final redirect URL down to the origin.
