Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23413:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the `jszip` library handles filenames within a ZIP archive. Specifically, the library uses a regular JavaScript object to store files, making it vulnerable to prototype pollution. If a crafted ZIP file contains filenames that match properties on the `Object.prototype` (e.g., `__proto__`, `toString`, etc.), these properties could be overwritten or modified, causing unexpected behavior or denial-of-service conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is prototype pollution, which occurs because the library was using regular JavaScript objects as dictionaries to store files. These objects inherit from `Object.prototype`, and attacker-controlled keys can overwrite inherited properties.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By crafting a zip file with filenames that overwrite `Object.prototype` methods, an attacker can cause the application using `jszip` to crash when these methods are subsequently called, or cause other unexpected behavior leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Application Crash:**  The most immediate impact is the potential for the application using the vulnerable library to crash. As demonstrated in the provided PoC, accessing `zip.files.toString()` will throw an error if the `toString` property is overridden by a file within the archive.
- **Unexpected Behavior:** The prototype pollution can result in unpredictable program behavior as fundamental methods and properties of objects may be altered, potentially leading to data corruption.
- **Denial of Service:** The crash will lead to the service/application being unavailable for use, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted ZIP File:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker providing a specially crafted ZIP file to an application using the `jszip` library. This ZIP file will contain filenames designed to overwrite properties of the base `Object.prototype`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide ZIP File:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable application with a crafted ZIP file. This could be through file uploads, data streams, or any other means by which the application processes ZIP files.
- **No Prior Authentication Required:**  The vulnerability does not require prior authentication or access to sensitive parts of the system to carry out the attack (Privileges Required: None)
- **Remote Exploitation:** This vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network. (Attack Vector: Network)

**Mitigation**

The vulnerability was mitigated in `jszip` version 3.7.0 by using `Object.create(null)` to create the files object which does not inherit from `Object.prototype`. Additionally, a test was added to ensure that the prototype is not modified.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as a CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), which aligns with a denial-of-service vulnerability.
- The CVSS score of 5.3 (Medium) accurately reflects the impact of the vulnerability and the accessibility by external attackers.

The provided information also includes discussion around the fix being backported to older versions which was subsequently merged in the later `3.7.1` release.
