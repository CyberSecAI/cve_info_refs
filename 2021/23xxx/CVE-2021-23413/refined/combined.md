Out of curiosity was there actually a report of such an issue as a file named *toString* that prompted this change? I ask because this actually introduced a bug in my code that uses jszip because i used *hasOwnProperty* on the *files* just like your own code above but now that throws because there is no such member.

Sorry, something went wrong.

[CVE-2021-23413  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-23413) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-400  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `jszip` to version 3.7.0 or higher.

## Overview

[jszip](https://www.npmjs.org/package/jszip) is a Create, read and edit .zip files with JavaScript <http://stuartk.com/jszip>

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS). Crafting a new zip file with filenames set to Object prototype values (e.g `__proto__,` `toString`, etc) results in a returned object with a modified prototype instance.

### PoC

```
const jszip = require('jszip');

async function loadZip() {
// this is a raw buffer of demo.zip containing 2 empty files:
// - "file.txt"
// - "toString"
const demoZip = Buffer.from('UEsDBBQACAAIANS8kVIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIACAAdG9TdHJpbmdVVA0AB3Bje2BmY3tgcGN7YHV4CwABBPUBAAAEFAAAAAMAUEsHCAAAAAACAAAAAAAAAFBLAwQUAAgACADDvJFSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAAgAGZpbGUudHh0VVQNAAdPY3tg4FJ7YE9je2B1eAsAAQT1AQAABBQAAAADAFBLBwgAAAAAAgAAAAAAAABQSwECFAMUAAgACADUvJFSAAAAAAIAAAAAAAAACAAgAAAAAAAAAAAApIEAAAAAdG9TdHJpbmdVVA0AB3Bje2BmY3tgcGN7YHV4CwABBPUBAAAEFAAAAFBLAQIUAxQACAAIAMO8kVIAAAAAAgAAAAAAAAAIACAAAAAAAAAAAACkgVgAAABmaWxlLnR4dFVUDQAHT2N7YOBSe2BPY3tgdXgLAAEE9QEAAAQUAAAAUEsFBgAAAAACAAIArAAAALAAAAAAAA==', 'base64');

const zip = await jszip.loadAsync(demoZip);
zip.files.toString(); // this will throw
return zip;
}
loadZip();

```
## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.

Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).
* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Aws%3A20171108)

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.3 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**

[@Stuk](https://github.com/Stuk) we could use `for(filename of Object.keys(this.files)) {` here instead, but it seems `jszip` is targetting es3 in `jshintrc`.

We could set this to `es6` but I assume this would break for a number of users and you would want to avoid that?

This is the error that comes up if I change it:

```
   ./lib/object.js
    182 |        for (filename of Object.keys(this.files)) {
                               ^ 'for of' is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).

```

Yeah, there's a bigger task for upgrading the tooling and browser compatibility for this library. The approach here looks good.

I tried removing the `Object.create(null)` fix, to see if this test failed and it didn't, so I don't think this is actually catching the issue?

That's a good point - but I'm not entirely sure how to test this change because essentially this change is about making sure `toString` / `__proto__` / `__constructor__` etc are not available in the first place.

I guess I could add a test that shows that `toString` raises an error - but I'm not sure how useful that would be in the long run?

The reasoning for this test specifically was to show that files with names that shadow standard Object method names can still be accessed correctly

#### Introduced: 18 Apr 2021

[CVE-2021-23413  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-23413) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-400  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses
## How to fix?

Upgrade `org.webjars:jszip` to version 3.7.1 or higher.

## Overview

[org.webjars:jszip](https://www.npmjs.org/package/jszip) is a Create, read and edit .zip files with JavaScript <http://stuartk.com/jszip>

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS). Crafting a new zip file with filenames set to Object prototype values (e.g `__proto__,` `toString`, etc) results in a returned object with a modified prototype instance.

### PoC

```
const jszip = require('jszip');

async function loadZip() {
// this is a raw buffer of demo.zip containing 2 empty files:

## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.

Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).
* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Aws%3A20171108)

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.3 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**
