Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23180:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A null pointer dereference in the `file_extension()` function within `file.c`. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs at line 337 where the code attempts to dereference a potentially null pointer returned by `strchr(buf, '#')`. This happens when a malformed URI is provided as input, leading to `strchr` returning NULL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The code doesn't check if the pointer returned by `strchr()` is NULL before attempting to dereference it. This lack of null check leads to a crash when `strchr` returns NULL because the character '#' is not found in the buffer `buf`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The null pointer dereference causes the program to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not directly stated, the GitHub Advisory mentions "may lead to execute arbitrary code" which is a typical risk for null pointer dereference in software. However, the primary impact seems to be DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed URI Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a malformed URI as input to the `htmldoc` tool. This input is processed by `file_extension()` function. The malformed URI lacks the '#' character that the code expects to find.
- **Fuzzing:** The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing, which indicates that automated testing can easily trigger it with crafted inputs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Level Access:** The attacker needs to provide a malformed URI to the `htmldoc` application, implying the need for some level of interaction with the vulnerable application, however, no special privileges are required.
- **Understanding of Input Formats:** The attacker would need to understand or discover the format of URIs that causes the null pointer dereference, though this seems to be easily triggered as shown by fuzzing.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by `chibataiki` and addressed by `michaelrsweet` with commit `19c582f`.
- The fix involves a null check on the return of `strchr(buf, '#')`, preventing dereference of the null pointer.
- Red Hat Bugzilla entry indicates that the issue affects various community distributions such as Fedora and EPEL.

In summary, CVE-2021-23180 is a null pointer dereference vulnerability in `htmldoc` triggered by malformed URI input, leading to denial of service. While the Github advisory mentioned potential arbitrary code execution, the primary impact is a crash and denial of service.
