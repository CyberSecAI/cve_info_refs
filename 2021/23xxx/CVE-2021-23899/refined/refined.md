Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities addressed in `com.mikesamuel:json-sanitizer` versions prior to 1.2.2, which are related to CVE-2021-23899:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the insufficient input sanitization within the OWASP json-sanitizer library. Specifically, crafted inputs can bypass the sanitizer's logic, leading to the generation of malicious outputs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **HTML/XML Injection:** The sanitizer may emit closing `</script>` tags or `]]>` delimiters for crafted input, which can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or XML into embedding documents.
2.  **Invalid JSON Output/Exceptions:** The sanitizer may output invalid JSON or throw an undeclared exception when processing specially crafted inputs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **HTML/XML Injection:**
    *   Attackers can inject malicious HTML/XML, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks in web applications that use the library.
    *   This could allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript, steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or deface web pages.
2.  **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   The invalid JSON output or uncaught exceptions can cause the application to malfunction or crash if it is not prepared to handle such scenarios, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector involves providing specially crafted JSON inputs to the `json-sanitizer` library. These inputs are designed to exploit the parser's weaknesses and cause it to produce malicious outputs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the input that is being processed by the vulnerable version of the `json-sanitizer` library.
*   The attacker does not need to be in a privileged position, as the vulnerability resides in the input processing logic of the library.

**Additional Notes**

*   The commit message `Tests for fixes for previously undisclosed vulnerabilities` and the discussion thread indicate that these vulnerabilities were found by fuzzing.
*   The provided content references CVE-2021-23899 and CVE-2021-23900, but only CVE-2021-23899 is being analyzed here.
*   The fix for these vulnerabilities is included in version 1.2.2 of the library.

In summary, the vulnerability in `com.mikesamuel:json-sanitizer` versions prior to 1.2.2 stems from improper handling of malicious inputs, leading to potential XSS attacks and denial-of-service conditions. This was addressed in version 1.2.2.
