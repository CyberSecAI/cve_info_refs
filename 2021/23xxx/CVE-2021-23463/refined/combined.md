| In researching this vulnerability, I found that the JdbcResultSet.getSQLXML() method is unsupported in all versions of H2 prior to 1.4.198. It appears that this only effects version 1.4.198 to 2.0.201, can we get the vulnerability updated so that it doesn't show that this effects older versions of H2? |

| The [CVE-2021-23463](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-23463) references this github page, I am not sure who reported or "confirmed" that it effected all previous versions of H2, but it is incorrect. I don't have access to the CVE page to make adjustments and I don't know who would.  Maven uses the CVE report to tag builds with vulnerabilities, and so all of the maven builds are miss-tags [on this page](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.h2database/h2). |

| You'd have to contact MITRE, they are the only ones who can update those entries. The person who requested the CVE likely said "all versions" which is very common to see in researcher and vendor disclosures, even if all versions were not tested. |

| Only 1.4.198, 1.4.199, and 1.4.200 are affected. (There is no version with build id 201.)  This vulnerability can only affect application when it calls one of these methods to read values from untrusted sources. If application doesn't call them (most applications don't call them), it is safe. If application calls them, but all XML values were generated by this application and they can't contain references to external pages, it is still safe. |

#### Introduced: 30 Oct 2021

[CVE-2021-23463  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-23463) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-611  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `com.h2database:h2` to version 2.0.202 or higher.

## Overview

[com.h2database:h2](http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) is a database engine

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) Injection via the `org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLXML` class object, when it receives parsed string data from `org.h2.jdbc.JdbcResultSet.getSQLXML()` method. If it executes the `getSource()` method when the parameter is `DOMSource.class` it will trigger the vulnerability.

## Details

XXE Injection is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input.
XML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing. When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.

Attacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier.

For example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element- username.

```
<xml>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
   <username>John</username>
</xml>

```

An external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML entity that would fetch the content of `/etc/passwd` and display it to the user rendered by `username`.

```
<xml>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
   <username>&xxe;</username>
</xml>

```

Other XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading to Denial of Service.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

8.1 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker requires privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges has the ability to access only non-sensitive resources.

  **Low**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 520 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2857016.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

| In researching this vulnerability, I found that the JdbcResultSet.getSQLXML() method is unsupported in all versions of H2 prior to 1.4.198. It appears that this only effects version 1.4.198 to 2.0.201, can we get the vulnerability updated so that it doesn't show that this effects older versions of H2? |

| The [CVE-2021-23463](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-23463) references this github page, I am not sure who reported or "confirmed" that it effected all previous versions of H2, but it is incorrect. I don't have access to the CVE page to make adjustments and I don't know who would.  Maven uses the CVE report to tag builds with vulnerabilities, and so all of the maven builds are miss-tags [on this page](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.h2database/h2). |

| You'd have to contact MITRE, they are the only ones who can update those entries. The person who requested the CVE likely said "all versions" which is very common to see in researcher and vendor disclosures, even if all versions were not tested. |

| Only 1.4.198, 1.4.199, and 1.4.200 are affected. (There is no version with build id 201.)  This vulnerability can only affect application when it calls one of these methods to read values from untrusted sources. If application doesn't call them (most applications don't call them), it is safe. If application calls them, but all XML values were generated by this application and they can't contain references to external pages, it is still safe. |

NetApp has a long-held and ongoing commitment to compliance with the ever-evolving set of global, regional, and data security and privacy standards and regulations. We uphold this commitment through self-assessments and rigorous audits by independent accredited third parties. These audits validate the adherence of our products and services to the requirements of such standards as ISO/IEC 27001, the GDPR, and the Common Criteria. These assessments help demonstrate NetApp’s integration of internationally recognized processes and best practices in our business, enabling customers to use our products and services regardless of their compliance needs.

NetApp supplies information for each compliance offering (listed at left) that includes a list of in-scope software and hardware and links to the relevant certificates and auditor’s reports.

| **Hello, I am threedr3am of [SecCoder Security Lab](https://www.seccoder.club/) (contact@seccoder.club).**  **We found a security vulnerability(SCSL-2021-1001) in the [H2-Database-Engine jar](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.h2database/h2) when using this component to connect to the h2 database , The returned data content field is parsed through SQLXML, which will cause the client XXE ([https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/XML\_External\_Entity\_(XXE)\_Processing](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/XML_External_Entity_%28XXE%29_Processing)).**   * Oracle mysql jdbc also recently fixed a similar security vulnerability, please refer to: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-2471> * This is their fix commit: [mysql/mysql-connector-j@4993d57](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-j/commit/4993d5735fd84a46e7d949ad1bcaa0e9bb039824)  vulnerability detail: When analyzing the data returned by the database, the org.h2.jdbc.JdbcResultSet class provides the getSQLXML(java.lang.String) method, which parses the string data into an object of the org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLXML class.

| Dear all,  this issue has been detected by our vulnerability scanner durint our last deployment Mid of October. This is rated as an high issue, which needs to be fixed by end of year. I guess many other companies will be also affected by this issue, that's why a quick fix by end of November would be very helpful.  Can some developers pick this up asap and share some updates in the next days?  Thanks and best regards, Sascha |

| The CVE has a score of 8.1 or 9.1, [depending on who you're asking](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23463). It can't just be ignored by anyone using H2, especially now that dependabot has started complaining about the dependency! You'll probably hear more very soon, given how annoying dependabot can be :)  So, folks *have to* upgrade to a quite backwards incompatible 2.0 release from 1.4. Given that 2.0 can't read the 1.4 file format, that's really a significant problem.  I've tried numerous times to throw money at the problem, and I'm not alone, see [#3048](https://github.com/h2database/h2database/issues/3048). But you don't seem to accept money 😅. So, is there any other way that would help convince maintainers to make an exception for this case, or even better, implement a branching strategy going forward?  My offer from [#3048](https://github.com/h2database/h2database/issues/3048) stands... |

| Migration from 1.4.196 to 1.4.197 and so on also requires a dump and restore, otherwise database will be corrupted (with exception for upgrade from 1.4.198 to a bugfix release 1.4.199). Various, but not all very old releases also require that step.  We made various changes to make upgrade much simpler for new versions and upgrade from 2.0.202 to new releases shouldn't be that complicated. But we can't fix data format and SQL export format of old releases and in some cases we can't even determine data types of some columns from H2 1.\* in reliable way.  At this time, a pull request in Hibernate ORM with a fix for an old issue [HHH-14180](https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-14180) can help a lot I guess. Some other projects are already updated. |

| Irrespective of the numbering scheme, all I'm saying is, if there were branches off each of these (major?) releases disguised as patch release numbers, then people could upgrade to get urgent fixes such as this one without having to deal with all the hassle of upgrading the rest.  To illustrate: A CVE this severe may need production patching. People can't risk taking down production by introducing 500 new features hastily just to get access to a CVE fix. That's how a 1.4.198.1, 1.4.199.1, 1.4.200.1 release (or whatever numbering scheme) would help a lot.  On a branch, automated tests and everything else still works as it used to, 2 years ago, untouched. So once the branching and branch releasing infrastructure is set up, then backports only consist of backporting the actual fix. I think this would definitely be worth it for important CVEs and bugs, no? |

I think this would definitely be worth it for important CVEs and bugs, no?  The back-port does not even need to be done by the H2 core team itself. Any interested developer could do it and submit a PR. But without a H2 branch, right now this is a futile attempt: I can write a PR against 1.4.200 but will never be able to publish it: my own repo is irrelevant and the official repo runs as a rolling release. |

| [@lukaseder](https://github.com/lukaseder) We need a stable base for patch releases and a some infrastructure for them, because internally there is no x.y.z scheme, releases are numbered sequentially, 197, 198, 199, 200 and so on. Hypothetically we can produce patch releases in the future, but only for H2 2.0+ and after some changes in their internal numbers.  The current plan is to fix unexpected regressions in 2.0.202 and publish a patch release in the near future (2.0.204 or something like it). These fixes by itself need a lot of time.  I guess nobody has a time to mess with 1.4.\* on our side. 1.4.200 is a completely outdated beta-quality version not really suitable for persistent databases, 1.4.199 is more reliable. Unfortunately, a bugfix release for 1.4.200 wasn't built when it was needed (like 1.4.199 was released to fix problems in buggy 1.4.198). Some people still use 1.4.197 or even 1.4.196, and these versions aren't affected by this vulnerability.  I should say again: if somebody wants to help, please, take a look on `H2Dialect`, `H2IdentityColumnSupport`, `H2SequenceSupport`, etc. in Hibernate ORM; their outdated state is the largest blocker for adoption of H2 2.0. |

| From what I'm reading here, it confirms that the advise we give customers for years now is still correct: don't use H2 for production deployments. Only for local/testing/demo applications. We stuck with 1.4.193 as any later version caused pains and showed unacceptable bugs. We're looking into postgresql as a free alternative, otherwise stick with mysql or the big name DBs when you plan to run critical production services. (however much we love the free and simple H2...!) |

| [@consultantleon](https://github.com/consultantleon), While I am not going to discuss suitability of H2 for various applications, I just wonder what do you mean by "unacceptable bugs"? If for some reason you think, that those dozens and dozens of bugs, that have been fixed since 1.4.193 were acceptable, but any new regressions are not, then good luck in your search for that bug-free database with pain-free upgrades and zero cost.  BTW, as a consultant you should be able to advise you clients on how to back-port vulnerability fix and build a patched version yourself. All it takes is to cherry-pick a single commit from one branch to another. The problem arises when you need to publish "official" patched builds for multiple versions (1.4.193 1.4.197, 1.4.199, ...?). Some may argue, that home-made patch just won't cut it for a company "Foo", but I doubt, if they would ever select any software, not backed by a company (and H2 is not), in a first place.  P.S. Don't forget to write that 1-star review on Yelp 😄. |

| [@katzyn](https://github.com/katzyn) and [@andreitokar](https://github.com/andreitokar) - if someone helps with the logistics; figuring out the right commit to branch off and such, getting tests and build to pass, would you be willing to assist the community in pushing a release with just this fix - say `1.4.200.1`?  Noting your comments on release numbering, perhaps it is sufficient for the community that this still identifies itself as `200`, even if the jars are named `1.4.200.1` (and arguably `1.4.199.1` if some have identified that they weren't supposed to use `200`)? Would such a compromise work?  I note [@wclarkpk](https://github.com/wclarkpk) seems to be working on it. I'm wondering how the community can help reduce the effort for you to make it as easy as possible to cut and push a release so we can avoid repeat work by the large number of folks who are possibly using `1.4` and are not yet ready to make the breaking-ish migration to `2.0.x`. |

| If you don't use affected methods of `java.sql.SQLXML` interface in your application you can safely ignore this vulnerability. It cannot be exposed if these methods aren't called. (Hibernate ORM doesn't call them by itself, BTW.)  More or less stable 1.4.199 has at least three security issues, all of them were discussed here, on GitHub, and nobody cares about other two. Why you want to fix only one that doesn't affect almost all applications? Other issues also affect only few applications, and yours may be not affected, but anyway.  Unfortunately, a fix of one of them cannot be backported to 1.4 series of releases without massive changes, it doesn't affect single-user applications, but it will be very strange to create a patch release for an outdated version that will still have security problems. |

| [@katzyn](https://github.com/katzyn) Thanks. I was not aware of other vulnerabilites in `1.4.200` or `1.4.199`. There are [none other that are filed against the CPE](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search/results?adv_search=true&isCpeNameSearch=true&query=cpe%3A2.3%3Aa%3Ah2database%3Ah2%3A1.4.200%3A*%3A*%3A*%3A*%3A*%3A*%3A*) for `1.4.200` [(or `1.4.199`](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search/results?adv_search=true&isCpeNameSearch=true&query=cpe%3A2.3%3Aa%3Ah2database%3Ah2%3A1.4.199%3A*%3A*%3A*%3A*%3A*%3A*%3A*)) at least. People rely on scanning tools to report issues with their transitives, due to the scale of most software - that is why this one is drawing more attention (rightly or wrongly). If there are indeed others such as [CVE-2018-14335](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wm64-883p-84j3 "CVE-2018-14335") (in changelog for `2.0.202`), they are filed incorrectly with Mitre/NIST NVD (or not at all), as that one is only reported specifically against `1.4.197`, not later versions.  I agree that the particular issue here doesn't affect everyone - for my particular usage I was intending to suppress with commentary and perhaps add static analysis rule to fail builds if this function is used (doesn't protect from libraries using it without some difficulty). Nevertheless, it does leave lingering risk for folks to have it there in case they start using that feature in future, and neglect some other practices.  I disagree with you that it is strange, since it's common practice to backport fixes when a new release makes breaking changes. However it depends what these other security issues are and their relative severity, likelihood of exploitation, available mitigations etc. It might be perfectly reasonable to patch a high/critical rated vulnerability while leaving a lower severity one unpatched (risk vs. effort/value).  Since I can't find those other ones, I can't really comment other than in general, however. If you can point me to the "difficult to backport" one, possible I'd better understand what you're getting at. |

| `GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE` gives access not only to DML, but also to DDL commands on the specified table to the specified unprivileged user. For example, it can drop this table, change its constraints or do something else. Backport of fix for this issue is too complicated. |

| In researching this vulnerability, I found that the JdbcResultSet.getSQLXML() method is unsupported in all versions of H2 prior to 1.4.198. It appears that this only effects version 1.4.198 to 2.0.201, can we get the vulnerability updated so that it doesn't show that this effects older versions of H2? |

| The [CVE-2021-23463](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-23463) references this github page, I am not sure who reported or "confirmed" that it effected all previous versions of H2, but it is incorrect. I don't have access to the CVE page to make adjustments and I don't know who would.  Maven uses the CVE report to tag builds with vulnerabilities, and so all of the maven builds are miss-tags [on this page](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.h2database/h2). |

| You'd have to contact MITRE, they are the only ones who can update those entries. The person who requested the CVE likely said "all versions" which is very common to see in researcher and vendor disclosures, even if all versions were not tested. |

| Only 1.4.198, 1.4.199, and 1.4.200 are affected. (There is no version with build id 201.)  This vulnerability can only affect application when it calls one of these methods to read values from untrusted sources. If application doesn't call them (most applications don't call them), it is safe. If application calls them, but all XML values were generated by this application and they can't contain references to external pages, it is still safe. |

| [@andreitokar](https://github.com/andreitokar) can this be backported to 1.4? Once we have a 1.4.201 release we can have Snyk and NIST adjust the CVE (did this before). |

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| In researching this vulnerability, I found that the JdbcResultSet.getSQLXML() method is unsupported in all versions of H2 prior to 1.4.198. It appears that this only effects version 1.4.198 to 2.0.201, can we get the vulnerability updated so that it doesn't show that this effects older versions of H2? |

| The [CVE-2021-23463](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-23463) references this github page, I am not sure who reported or "confirmed" that it effected all previous versions of H2, but it is incorrect. I don't have access to the CVE page to make adjustments and I don't know who would.  Maven uses the CVE report to tag builds with vulnerabilities, and so all of the maven builds are miss-tags [on this page](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.h2database/h2). |

| Only 1.4.198, 1.4.199, and 1.4.200 are affected. (There is no version with build id 201.)  This vulnerability can only affect application when it calls one of these methods to read values from untrusted sources. If application doesn't call them (most applications don't call them), it is safe. If application calls them, but all XML values were generated by this application and they can't contain references to external pages, it is still safe. |

| In researching this vulnerability, I found that the JdbcResultSet.getSQLXML() method is unsupported in all versions of H2 prior to 1.4.198. It appears that this only effects version 1.4.198 to 2.0.201, can we get the vulnerability updated so that it doesn't show that this effects older versions of H2? |

| The [CVE-2021-23463](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-23463) references this github page, I am not sure who reported or "confirmed" that it effected all previous versions of H2, but it is incorrect. I don't have access to the CVE page to make adjustments and I don't know who would.  Maven uses the CVE report to tag builds with vulnerabilities, and so all of the maven builds are miss-tags [on this page](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.h2database/h2). |

| Only 1.4.198, 1.4.199, and 1.4.200 are affected. (There is no version with build id 201.)  This vulnerability can only affect application when it calls one of these methods to read values from untrusted sources. If application doesn't call them (most applications don't call them), it is safe. If application calls them, but all XML values were generated by this application and they can't contain references to external pages, it is still safe. |

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

| In researching this vulnerability, I found that the JdbcResultSet.getSQLXML() method is unsupported in all versions of H2 prior to 1.4.198. It appears that this only effects version 1.4.198 to 2.0.201, can we get the vulnerability updated so that it doesn't show that this effects older versions of H2? |

| The [CVE-2021-23463](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-23463) references this github page, I am not sure who reported or "confirmed" that it effected all previous versions of H2, but it is incorrect. I don't have access to the CVE page to make adjustments and I don't know who would.  Maven uses the CVE report to tag builds with vulnerabilities, and so all of the maven builds are miss-tags [on this page](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.h2database/h2). |

| You'd have to contact MITRE, they are the only ones who can update those entries. The person who requested the CVE likely said "all versions" which is very common to see in researcher and vendor disclosures, even if all versions were not tested. |

| Only 1.4.198, 1.4.199, and 1.4.200 are affected. (There is no version with build id 201.)  This vulnerability can only affect application when it calls one of these methods to read values from untrusted sources. If application doesn't call them (most applications don't call them), it is safe. If application calls them, but all XML values were generated by this application and they can't contain references to external pages, it is still safe. |

| [@andreitokar](https://github.com/andreitokar) can this be backported to 1.4? Once we have a 1.4.201 release we can have Snyk and NIST adjust the CVE (did this before). |

| Hey folks,  I've been getting *a lot* of value out of H2 throughout my work on jOOQ, using H2:   * As the primary integration test database for quick feedback, along with MySQL * As the default dialect to interpret DDL for code generation and other purposes * As highly standards compliant test database to play around with syntax, etc.   In short, I wouldn't be where I am without H2. I'd love to pay for your service via my company, hoping that H2's excellent service will continue for many years. Given that there isn't a company behind H2, I thought you might still be interested in accepting sponsorships either through github (similar to <https://github.com/testcontainers>, where Data Geekery / jOOQ is also a sponsor), or Patreon, or some other channel? I'm sure many others will follow if this is advertised well enough.  Of course, an actual licensed H2 professional edition would be even better, but I had already discussed this with you in the past, and we concluded that it won't happen :) |

| I've noticed there's a donation button at the bottom of this page: <https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html> Why have I never seen it?? 😁  Is that still the recommended approach here? I would personally prefer a subscription over a one-shot payment. Also, it seems to go to [@thomasmueller](https://github.com/thomasmueller), who has created H2. While Thomas obviously deserves a big share, I currently had [@katzyn](https://github.com/katzyn) in mind, who has been exceptionally helpful (to me). Will the donation get distributed? |

Indeed, the bulk of work is being done by [@katzyn](https://github.com/katzyn) these days, with [@andreitokar](https://github.com/andreitokar) also making some excellent contributions.  thomas seems to be busy with other stuff these days, I'm not sure what happens with that donation button. |

Unfortunately I'm not aware of anyone readily available for such, the current primary contributors all have full time jobs.

| In researching this vulnerability, I found that the JdbcResultSet.getSQLXML() method is unsupported in all versions of H2 prior to 1.4.198. It appears that this only effects version 1.4.198 to 2.0.201, can we get the vulnerability updated so that it doesn't show that this effects older versions of H2? |

| The [CVE-2021-23463](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-23463) references this github page, I am not sure who reported or "confirmed" that it effected all previous versions of H2, but it is incorrect. I don't have access to the CVE page to make adjustments and I don't know who would.  Maven uses the CVE report to tag builds with vulnerabilities, and so all of the maven builds are miss-tags [on this page](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.h2database/h2). |

| You'd have to contact MITRE, they are the only ones who can update those entries. The person who requested the CVE likely said "all versions" which is very common to see in researcher and vendor disclosures, even if all versions were not tested. |

| Only 1.4.198, 1.4.199, and 1.4.200 are affected. (There is no version with build id 201.)  This vulnerability can only affect application when it calls one of these methods to read values from untrusted sources. If application doesn't call them (most applications don't call them), it is safe. If application calls them, but all XML values were generated by this application and they can't contain references to external pages, it is still safe. |

Besides many dozens of fixed bugs, performance improvements,

more adherence to a standard SQL syntax and type system, there are

Some new features:

* Complete re-work of INFORMATION\_SCHEMA to be more in-line with the standard
* Support for new types: ARRAY, ROW, JAVA\_OBJECT
* Numerous bit, string, array and system functions implemented
* Standard-based access to generated keys
* JDBC 4.2 compliance
* Support for JDK 7 is dropped
* PageStore is discontinued

MVStore changes:

* Descending MVMap and TransactionMap cursor
* Disk space reclamation algorithm improvements

Between version 1.4.200 and version 2.0.202 there have been considerable changes, such that a simple update is

not possible.

The official way to upgrade is to do a BACKUP of your existing database **USING YOUR CURRENT VERSION OF H2.**

Then create a fresh database **USING THE NEW VERSION OF H2**, then perform a SCRIPT to load your data.

As we continue to tout the key elements of security including key management,
we understand the challenges and value of timeliness as it applies to adoption
and deployment. Due to such challenges we provide integration guides where we
walk through the configuration/provisioning of âkeyâ elements such as key
managers, FPolicy, and other security laden integration solutions.
