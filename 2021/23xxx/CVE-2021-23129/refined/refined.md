- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing filtering of messages displayed to users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when alert messages are displayed to the user. An attacker could likely inject malicious code into the message input, which would then be rendered on the user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the message content that is displayed to the user to inject malicious scripts.
