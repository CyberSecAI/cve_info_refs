Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof of conceptEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

[CVE-2021-23348  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-23348) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-77  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `portprocesses` to version 1.0.5 or higher.

## Overview

[portprocesses](https://www.npmjs.org/package/portprocesses) is a This tool letes you list and kill processes on a specified port.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Command Injection. If (attacker-controlled) user input is given to the `killProcess` function, it is possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
This is due to use of the `child_process` `exec` function without input sanitization.

## PoC (provided by reporter):

```
var portprocesses = require('portprocesses');

portprocesses.killProcess('$(touch success)');

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

6.3 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker requires privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges has the ability to access only non-sensitive resources.

  **Low**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**

# Arbitrary Command Injection

Moderate

[fishcharlie](/fishcharlie)
published
GHSA-vm67-7vmg-66vm
Mar 31, 2021

## Package

npm

portprocesses
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 1.0.4

## Patched versions

1.0.5

## Description

### Impact

An Arbitrary Command Injection vulnerability was reported in `portprocesses` impacting versions <= 1.0.4.

### Example (Proof of Concept)

The following example demonstrates the vulnerability and will run `touch success` therefore creating a file named `success`.
