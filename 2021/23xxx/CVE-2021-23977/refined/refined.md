Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-23977:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability exists in Firefox for Android.
*   The vulnerability occurs when a malicious application manipulates file system resources while Firefox is attempting to access them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **TOCTOU:** A malicious application can create a symlink pointing to sensitive Firefox data files within the `/data/data/org.mozilla.firefox/` directory after Firefox has checked for the file's existence, but before Firefox accesses it.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** Firefox does not validate the file path to prevent external loading of internal files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Data Theft:** A malicious application can read private files belonging to the Firefox application, including:
    *   Shared preferences files (e.g., `org.mozilla.firefox_preferences.xml`) that may contain sensitive information like FCM Push Tokens, `fxa_push_scope`, Leanplum data, and other application settings.
    *  Potentially access other files within the  `/data/data/org.mozilla.firefox/` directory.
*   **Abuse of File Permissions:** By creating the symlink and setting file permissions, the attacker makes the target file readable by Firefox.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Application:** The attacker must have a malicious application installed on the same device as Firefox for Android.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The malicious application creates a file (e.g., `test.html`) inside its data directory, then uses a symlink to point that file to a sensitive file in the Firefox app's data directory.
*   **Intent Trigger:** The malicious app uses an Android intent to request Firefox to load the crafted file (symlink).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Installed Malicious App:** The attacker must be able to install a malicious application on the victim's Android device.
*   **Basic Android Development Knowledge:** The attacker needs the ability to create an Android app, including creating symlinks.
*   **File System Access:** The malicious app needs to have access to its own data directory on the Android file system.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 86 by preventing file:// and content:// URLs from being loaded via intents, particularly from the application's data directory.
*   The issue is specific to Firefox for Android; other operating systems are not affected.
* The vulnerability was rated as sec-moderate.
