Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-23850:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A buffer overflow exists in the recovery image's telnet interface when handling a specially crafted TCP/IP packet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow, indicating that the overflow occurs in the memory allocated for function calls on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A crafted TCP/IP packet can cause the telnet interface to crash.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The buffer overflow can potentially be exploited to achieve remote code execution by overwriting adjacent memory regions on the stack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is performed over a network via TCP/IP.
*   **Recovery Image:** The vulnerability is located in the recovery image. The recovery image is only loaded when booting the device into recovery mode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access or Administrative Access:** The attacker needs either physical access to the device to boot into recovery mode or administrative privileges to issue a command that forces the device to boot into recovery mode.
*   **Network Access:**  After the device is in recovery mode, the attacker needs network access to send the malicious TCP/IP packet.

**Additional Information:**

*   The recovery image is used for firmware upload in case of a damaged main firmware.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Andrey Muravitsky from Kaspersky ICS CERT.
*   Affected products are Bosch CPP Firmware on CPP4, CPP6, CPP7, and CPP7.3 platforms.
*   Mitigations include updating to the fixed firmware and general security measures such as XSS/CSRF protection and physical protection of the cameras.
*   A software update is provided to fix the vulnerability.
