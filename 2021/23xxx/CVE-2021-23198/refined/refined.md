The provided content is related to CVE-2021-23198.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. Specifically, the affected product has a feature where the password can be specified, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary operating system commands through a specific parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- OS Command Injection (CWE-78):  The software fails to properly sanitize or neutralize special elements within user-controlled input, which are used in constructing operating system commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Complete compromise of the product: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands. This can lead to:
    - Full control over the system.
    - Data breaches
    - System unavailability
    - Other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
- Input parameter manipulation: An attacker can inject malicious OS commands through a specific parameter where a password can be specified.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attacker with network access to the affected system.
- No special authentication or user interaction is needed (Low attack complexity).
