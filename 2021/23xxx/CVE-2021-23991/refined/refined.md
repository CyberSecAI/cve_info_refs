Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23991:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from Thunderbird's improper handling of OpenPGP keys with invalid subkeys. Specifically, Thunderbird was automatically importing updated keys, including new subkeys, without adequately verifying the validity of those subkeys using the RNP library. Even if RNP flagged a subkey as invalid, Thunderbird would silently accept it and attempt to use it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Subkey Validation:** Thunderbird did not properly validate the subkeys using the RNP library, leading to the acceptance of invalid subkeys.
*   **Automatic Key Import:** Thunderbird automatically imports keys with an already trusted fingerprint when it detects an update to a key, which can be abused by attackers.
*   **Silent Acceptance of Invalid Subkeys:** Even when RNP identified a subkey as invalid, Thunderbird would import it without notifying the user or taking action to prevent its usage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could craft a malicious OpenPGP key with an invalid subkey. If a Thunderbird user imported this key, Thunderbird would try to use the invalid subkey for email encryption, but RNP would reject it, causing the encryption process to fail, preventing the user from sending encrypted emails.
*   **Key Poisoning:** An attacker could send a crafted version of a trusted user's key with an invalid subkey. Thunderbird would import this, and the user would not be able to send encrypted emails to the trusted user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email:** An attacker could send an email containing a crafted OpenPGP key as an attachment.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker could potentially intercept and modify a legitimate key during a key refresh operation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to send email:** The attacker must be able to send emails to the victim.
*   **Knowledge of victim's trusted keys:** The attacker should know the fingerprint of the victim's already trusted keys to craft a malicious version.
*   **Manipulation of OpenPGP keys:** The attacker must be able to create OpenPGP keys containing invalid subkeys.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Cure53.
*   The fix involved using new RNP APIs to check the validity of keys and subkeys.
*   The fix prevents the use of invalid keys and user IDs.
*   The fix still allows for automatic import of keys, but the invalid key details will no longer result in DoS.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Thunderbird 78.9.1
*   The vulnerability is related to CVE-2021-23993 which also deals with DoS due to invalid subkeys.
