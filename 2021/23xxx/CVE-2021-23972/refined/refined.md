Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-23972

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Firefox handles HTTP authentication warnings in conjunction with cached redirects.
- The `nsHttpChannelAuthProvider::CheckForSuperfluousAuth` function was only being called for network responses, not for cached responses. This meant that if a redirect to a malicious URL with HTTP Auth was cached, the warning would not be displayed, bypassing the intended security mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Missing check for cached redirects**: The primary vulnerability is the lack of a check for superfluous authentication in cached HTTP responses. The check, `nsHttpChannelAuthProvider::CheckForSuperfluousAuth`, was not being called for cached redirects.
- **Bypass of HTTP Auth phishing warning**: This allowed an attacker to bypass the warning prompt designed to protect against HTTP authentication spoofing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing attacks**: Attackers could craft a URL that uses HTTP authentication to redirect to a malicious site. If a user had previously visited a legitimate website that redirects to the attacker's site, that redirect would be cached. When the user would then visit the malicious link, the browser wouldn't display the warning, potentially tricking the user into entering credentials on a phishing page.
- **Credential theft**: Successful exploitation would allow attackers to steal user credentials when they are entered on a fake login prompt.
- **Low severity:** While dangerous, this vulnerability is considered low severity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URLs with HTTP Auth**: The attack involves crafting a URL with an embedded HTTP authentication part (e.g., `https://www.phishingtarget.com@evil.com`).
- **Cached Redirects:** The exploit relies on the user having previously visited a site that redirects to the attacker's malicious site, thus caching the redirect.
- **User interaction**: The user needs to click on the malicious link after the redirect has been cached.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to create malicious URLs**: Attackers need to create URLs using HTTP authentication.
- **Ability to host a malicious website or service**: Attackers need a web server or service that can be redirected to by a legitimate site.
- **Targeted User:** The attacker needs a user to have previously visited a site that redirects to the attacker's malicious site to cache the redirect.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was not related to the use of emoji in the URL, as initially suggested, but rather to the caching of redirects.
- The fix involves ensuring that `nsHttpChannelAuthProvider::CheckForSuperfluousAuth` is called for cached responses as well.
- The fix is present in Firefox 86 and later versions.
