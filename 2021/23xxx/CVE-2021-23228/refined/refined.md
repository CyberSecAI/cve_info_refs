Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-23228:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize user-controlled input in the  “.NET Request.QueryString”, which leads to a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application reflects user-provided input without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the page's output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser session.
- This could lead to various attacks like:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirection to malicious sites
    - Stealing sensitive information

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker would need to craft a malicious URL containing the payload in the query string parameter of the vulnerable page.
- The attacker would then need to trick a user into clicking the malicious URL, typically through phishing or social engineering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with a JavaScript payload.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking the malicious link.
- The attacker doesn't need prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory specifies this vulnerability is present in error pages returned by the application.
- The CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 7.5, indicating a high severity. The CVSS vector string is AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N, which breaks down to:
    - Attack Vector: Network
