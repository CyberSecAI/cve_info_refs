{
  "CVE-2021-23840": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the output length argument of EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_EncryptUpdate and EVP_DecryptUpdate functions when the input length is near the platform's maximum permissible integer length.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow leading to negative output length values and potential application crash.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Applications may behave incorrectly or crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "Attacker supplies input length close to maximum permissible for an integer",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to supply input with a specific length to trigger the vulnerability."
