#### Description

Calls to EVP\_CipherUpdate, EVP\_EncryptUpdate and EVP\_DecryptUpdate may overflow the output length argument in some cases where the input length is close to the maximum permissable length for an integer on the platform. In such cases the return value from the function call will be 1 (indicating success), but the output length value will be negative. This could cause applications to behave incorrectly or crash. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-1971

The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those
name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which
compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function
behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer
dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses
the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names
between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certiﬁcate 2) When
verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via
the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control
both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can
trick a client or server into checking a malicious certiﬁcate against a malicious CRL then this may occur.
Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certiﬁcate.
This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certiﬁcate and CRL being veriﬁed. OpenSSL’s
s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the “-crl_download” option which implements
automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note
that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct
encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that
OpenSSL’s parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are
affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed
in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).

Node.js versions before 10.23.1, 12.20.1, 14.15.4, 15.5.1 are vulnerable to a use-after-free bug
in its TLS implementation. When writing to a TLS enabled socket, node::StreamBase::Write calls
node::TLSWrap::DoWrite with a freshly allocated WriteWrap object as ﬁrst argument. If the DoWrite
method does not return an error, this object is passed back to the caller as part of a StreamWriteResult
structure. This may be exploited to corrupt memory leading to a Denial of Service or potentially other
exploits.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-8625

BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are conﬁgured to use GSS-
TSIG features. In a conﬁguration which uses BIND’s default settings the vulnerable code path is
not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting valid values for the tkey-
gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credentialconﬁguration options. Although the default conﬁguration is not
vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well
as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers.
The most likely outcome of a successful exploitation of the vulnerability is a crash of the named
process. However, remote code execution, while unproven, is theoretically possible. Affects: BIND
9.5.0 -> 9.11.27, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.11, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.27-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 ->

An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello message

it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension then a
NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack. A server is only
vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which is the default conﬁguration). OpenSSL
TLS clients are not impacted by this issue. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions are affected by this issue.
Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this

Vulnerability CVE-2021-3450

The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT ﬂag enables additional security checks of the certiﬁcates present
in a certiﬁcate chain.
It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to
disallow certiﬁcates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added
as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a
previous check to conﬁrm that certiﬁcates in the chain are valid CA certiﬁcates was overwritten. This
effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certiﬁcates must not be able to issue other certiﬁcates. If a
“purpose” has been conﬁgured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certiﬁcate is
a valid CA. All of the named “purpose” values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore,
where a purpose is set the certiﬁcate chain will still be rejected even when the strict ﬂag has been
used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certiﬁcate veriﬁcation routines, but it can
be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly
set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT veriﬁcation ﬂag and either not set a purpose for the certiﬁcate
veriﬁcation or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL
versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to
OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected

Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page
Generation (‘Cross-site Scripting’)

Vulnerability CVE-2021-3711

In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function
EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The ﬁrst time, on en-
try, the “out” parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the “outlen” parameter is populated with the buffer
size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufﬁciently sized
buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the “out”
parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of
the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the ﬁrst call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can
be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overﬂow when
EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A
malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause

Vulnerability CVE-2021-3712

ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which
contains a buffer holding the string data and a ﬁeld holding the buffer length. This contrasts with
normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL
(0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL’s own “d2i”
functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the
ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING
structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures
which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the “data” and “length” ﬁelds in the
ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous
OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING
byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been
directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where
that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application
without NUL terminating the “data” ﬁeld, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can
also occur during name constraints processing of certiﬁcates (for example if a certiﬁcate has been
directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and
the certiﬁcate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures).
It can also occur in the
X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor
can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of
the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing
a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such
as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in
OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y).

proxy can trick libcurl to use the wrong session ticket resume for the host and thereby circumvent
the server TLS certiﬁcate check and make a MITM attack to be possible to perform unnoticed. Note
that such a malicious HTTPS proxy needs to provide a certiﬁcate that curl will accept for the MITMed

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22901

curl 7.75.0 through 7.76.1 suffers from a use-after-free vulnerability resulting in already freed memory
being used when a TLS 1.3 session ticket arrives over a connection. A malicious server can use
this in rare unfortunate circumstances to potentially reach remote code execution in the client. When
libcurl at run-time sets up support for TLS 1.3 session tickets on a connection using OpenSSL, it
stores pointers to the transfer in-memory object for later retrieval when a session ticket arrives. If
the connection is used by multiple transfers (like with a reused HTTP/1.1 connection or multiplexed
HTTP/2 connection) that ﬁrst transfer object might be freed before the new session is established on
that connection and then the function will access a memory buffer that might be freed. When using
that memory, libcurl might even call a function pointer in the object, making it possible for a remote
code execution if the server could somehow manage to get crafted memory content into the correct
place in memory.

settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly
setting values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential conﬁguration options. Although
the default conﬁguration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND
is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with
Active Directory domain controllers. For servers that meet these conditions, the ISC SPNEGO
implementation is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on the CPU architecture for which BIND
was built: For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platforms, this ﬂaw can be used to trigger a buffer
over-read, leading to a server crash. For named binaries compiled for 32-bit platforms, this ﬂaw can
be used to trigger a server crash due to a buffer overﬂow and possibly also to achieve remote code
execution. We have determined that standard SPNEGO implementations are available in the MIT and
Heimdal Kerberos libraries, which support a broad range of operating systems, rendering the ISC
implementation unnecessary and obsolete. Therefore, to reduce the attack surface for BIND users,
we will be removing the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND 9.11 and 9.16 (it
had already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally remove something from a stable
ESV (Extended Support Version) of BIND, but since system libraries can replace the ISC SPNEGO
implementation, we have made an exception in this case for reasons of stability and security.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-32803

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary
File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufﬁcient symlink protection. node-tar aims to guarantee
that any ﬁle whose location would be modiﬁed by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part,
achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent
unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when
directories are created. This logic was insufﬁcient when extracting tar ﬁles that contained both a
directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the
directory being created and added to the node-tar directory cache. When a directory is present in the
directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where
node-tar checks for symlinks occur. By ﬁrst creating a directory, and then replacing that directory
with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially
allowing an untrusted tar ﬁle to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary
ﬁles into that location, thus allowing arbitrary ﬁle creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in
releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-32804

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.1, 5.0.6, 4.4.14, and 3.3.2 has a arbitrary File
Creation/Overwrite vulnerability due to insufﬁcient absolute path sanitization. node-tar aims to prevent
extraction of absolute ﬁle paths by turning absolute paths into relative paths when the preservePaths
ﬂag is not set to true. This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute ﬁle paths
contained in a tar ﬁle. For example /home/user/.bashrc would turn into home/user/.bashrc. This
logic was insufﬁcient when ﬁle paths contained repeated path roots such as ////home/user/.bashrc.
node-tar would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute ﬁle path with
repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. ///home/user/.bashrc) would still resolve to an absolute
path, thus allowing arbitrary ﬁle creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2,
4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a
custom onentry method which sanitizes the entry.path or a filter method which removes entries
with absolute paths. See referenced GitHub Advisory for details. Be aware of CVE-2021-32803 which
ﬁxes a similar bug in later versions of tar.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37701

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.16, 5.0.8, and 6.1.7 has an arbitrary ﬁle
creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any ﬁle
whose location would be modiﬁed by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by
ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary
stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are
created. This logic was insufﬁcient when extracting tar ﬁles that contained both a directory and a
symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive
entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both
\ and / characters as path separators, however \ is a valid ﬁlename character on posix systems.
By ﬁrst creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to
bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar ﬁle to symlink
into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary ﬁles into that location, thus allowing
arbitrary ﬁle creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive
ﬁlesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at FOO, followed by a symbolic link named foo, then
on case-insensitive ﬁle systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from
the ﬁlesystem, but not from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit.
A subsequent ﬁle entry within the FOO directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic
link, thinking that the directory had already been created. These issues were addressed in releases
4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches
for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version
of node-tar. If this is not possible, a workaround is available in the referenced GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37712

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary ﬁle
creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any ﬁle
whose location would be modiﬁed by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by
ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary
stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are
created. This logic was insufﬁcient when extracting tar ﬁles that contained both a directory and a
symlink with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on
Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same ﬁle system entities as their 8.3 “short
path” counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include a directory with one form of the
path, followed by a symbolic link with a different string that resolves to the same ﬁle system entity,
followed by a ﬁle using the ﬁrst form. By ﬁrst creating a directory, and then replacing that directory
with a symlink that had a different apparent name that resolved to the same entry in the ﬁlesystem, it
was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted
tar ﬁle to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary ﬁles into that location,
thus allowing arbitrary ﬁle creation and overwrite. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18,
5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for
these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37713

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary ﬁle
creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any ﬁle
whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. This is, in part,
accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that
contain .. path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This
logic was insufﬁcient on Windows systems when extracting tar ﬁles that contained a path that was not
an absolute path, but speciﬁed a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as C:some\path.
If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example D:\extraction\dir, then the result
of path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath) would resolve against the current working
directory on the C: drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a .. portion of the
path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as C:../foo, and was not properly sanitized
by the logic that checked for .. within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects
users of node-tar on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and
6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues.
If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar.
There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization
procedures that node-tar now does. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions
of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-39134

@npmcli/arborist, the library that calculates dependency trees and manages the node_modules
folder hierarchy for the npm command line interface, aims to guarantee that package dependency con-
tracts will be met, and the extraction of package contents will always be performed into the expected
folder. This is, in part, accomplished by resolving dependency speciﬁers deﬁned in package.json man-
ifests for dependencies with a speciﬁc name, and nesting folders to resolve conﬂicting dependencies.
When multiple dependencies differ only in the case of their name, Arborist’s internal data structure saw
them as separate items that could coexist within the same level in the node_modules hierarchy. How-
ever, on case-insensitive ﬁle systems (such as macOS and Windows), this is not the case. Combined
with a symlink dependency such as file:/some/path, this allowed an attacker to create a situation in
which arbitrary contents could be written to any location on the ﬁlesystem. For example, a package
pwn-a could deﬁne a dependency in their package.json ﬁle such as "foo": "file:/some/path". An-
other package, pwn-b could deﬁne a dependency such as FOO: "file:foo.tgz". On case-insensitive
ﬁle systems, if pwn-a was installed, and then pwn-b was installed afterwards, the contents of foo.tgz
would be written to /some/path, and any existing contents of /some/path would be removed. Anyone
using npm v7.20.6 or earlier on a case-insensitive ﬁlesystem is potentially affected. This is patched in
@npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-39135

@npmcli/arborist, the library that calculates dependency trees and manages the node_modules
folder hierarchy for the npm command line interface, aims to guarantee that package dependency
contracts will be met, and the extraction of package contents will always be performed into the
expected folder. This is accomplished by extracting package contents into a project’s node_modules
folder. If the node_modules folder of the root project or any of its dependencies is somehow replaced
with a symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies to any arbitrary location on
the ﬁle system. Note that symbolic links contained within package artifact contents are ﬁltered out, so
another means of creating a node_modules symbolic link would have to be employed. 1. A preinstall
script could replace node_modules with a symlink. (This is prevented by using --ignore-scripts.)
2. An attacker could supply the target with a git repository, instructing them to run npm install
--ignore-scripts in the root. This may be successful, because npm install --ignore-scripts is
typically not capable of making changes outside of the project directory, so it may be deemed safe.
This is patched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above. For more
information including workarounds please see the referenced GHSA-gmw6-94gg-2rc2.

# [R1] LCE 6.0.9 Fixes Multiple Third-party Vulnerabilities

High

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Tenable Log Correlation Engine leverages third-party software to help provide underlying functionality. Two separate third-party components (OpenSSL, jQuery) were found to contain vulnerabilities, and updated versions have been made available by the providers.

Out of caution and in line with good practice, Tenable opted to upgrade the bundled OpenSSL and jQuery components to address the potential impact of these issues. LCE 6.0.9 updates OpenSSL to version 1.1.1k and jQuery to version 3.5.1 to address the identified vulnerabilities.

### Solution

Tenable has released Log Correlation Engine 6.0.9 to address these issues. The installation files can be obtained from the Tenable Downloads Portal (https://www.tenable.com/downloads/log-correlation-engine).

*This page contains information regarding security vulnerabilities that may impact Tenable's products. This may include issues specific to our software, or due to the use of third-party libraries within our software. Tenable strongly encourages users to ensure that they upgrade or apply relevant patches in a timely manner.*

*Tenable takes product security very seriously. If you believe you have found a vulnerability in one of our products, we ask that you please work with us to quickly resolve it in order to protect customers.
Tenable believes in responding quickly to such reports, maintaining communication with researchers, and providing a solution in short order.*

*For more details on submitting vulnerability information, please see our [Vulnerability Reporting Guidelines](/security/report) page.*

*If you have questions or corrections about this advisory, please email
[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#721316041b011d001b17013206171c13101e175c111d1f)*

OpenSSL Security Advisory [16 February 2021]
============================================
Null pointer deref in X509\_issuer\_and\_serial\_hash() (CVE-2021-23841)
====================================================================
Severity: Moderate
The OpenSSL public API function X509\_issuer\_and\_serial\_hash() attempts to
create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained
within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors
that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer
field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL
pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack.
The function X509\_issuer\_and\_serial\_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL
itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly
and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted
sources.
OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these
versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j.
OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL
1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support
customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade
to 1.1.1j.
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 15th December 2020 by Tavis Ormandy from
Google. The fix was developed by Matt Caswell.
Incorrect SSLv2 rollback protection (CVE-2021-23839)
====================================================
Severity: Low
OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a
server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS
versions then a check is made for a version rollback attack when unpadding an
RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are
supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than
SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special
form of padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has
occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2, and yet this
is the version that is being requested).
The implementation of this padding check inverted the logic so that the
connection attempt is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it
is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if a version
rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a
connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made.
Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected by this
issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must:
1) have configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default),
2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default),
3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite
list)
OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to
this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation of the
RSA\_padding\_check\_SSLv23() function. This also affects the RSA\_SSLV23\_PADDING
padding mode used by various other functions. Although 1.1.1 does not support
SSLv2 the RSA\_padding\_check\_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the
RSA\_SSLV23\_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function
or use that padding mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no
support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a
security issue in that version.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium
support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should
upgrade to 1.1.1j.
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 21st January 2021 by D. Katz and Joel
Luellwitz from Trustwave. The fix was developed by Matt Caswell.
Integer overflow in CipherUpdate (CVE-2021-23840)
=================================================
Severity: Low
Calls to EVP\_CipherUpdate, EVP\_EncryptUpdate and EVP\_DecryptUpdate may overflow
the output length argument in some cases where the input length is close to the
maximum permissable length for an integer on the platform. In such cases the
return value from the function call will be 1 (indicating success), but the
output length value will be negative. This could cause applications to behave
incorrectly or crash.
OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these
versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j.
OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL
1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support
customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade
to 1.1.1j.
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 13th December 2020 by Paul Kehrer. The fix
was developed by Matt Caswell.
Note
====
OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Extended
support is available for premium support customers:
https://www.openssl.org/support/contracts.html
OpenSSL 1.1.0 is out of support and no longer receiving updates of any kind.
The impact of these issues on OpenSSL 1.1.0 has not been analysed.
Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1.

# [R1] Nessus Network Monitor 5.13.1 Fixes Multiple Third-party Vulnerabilities

Medium

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Nessus Network Monitor leverages third-party software to help provide underlying functionality. One of the third-party components (OpenSSL) was found to contain vulnerabilities, and updated versions have been made available by the providers.

Out of caution and in line with good practice, Tenable opted to upgrade the bundled OpenSSL components to address the potential impact of these issues. Nessus Network Monitor 5.13.1 updates OpenSSL to version 1.1.1k to address the identified vulnerabilities.

### Solution

Tenable has released Nessus Network Monitor 5.13.1 to address these issues. The installation files can be obtained from the Tenable Downloads Portal (https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus-network-monitor).

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 520 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2857016.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 54 new security patches plus additional third party patches noted below for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  41 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html#FMW)

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security updates are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the Critical Patch Update April 2022 to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2022 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2853458.2](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2853458.2).

#### Description

Server or client applications that call the SSL\_check\_chain() function during or after a TLS 1.3 handshake may crash due to a NULL pointer dereference as a result of incorrect handling of the "signature\_algorithms\_cert" TLS extension. The crash occurs if an invalid or unrecognised signature algorithm is received from the peer. This could be exploited by a malicious peer in a Denial of Service attack. OpenSSL version 1.1.1d, 1.1.1e, and 1.1.1f are affected by this issue. This issue did not affect OpenSSL versions prior to 1.1.1d. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1g (Affected 1.1.1d-1.1.1f).

#### Description

The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL\_NAME\_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL\_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL\_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL\_NAME\_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS\_RESP\_verify\_response and TS\_RESP\_verify\_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s\_server, s\_client and verify tools have support for the "-crl\_download" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 419 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2809080.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 38 new security patches for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  30 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html#FMW)

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security updates are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the Critical Patch Update October 2021 to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update October 2021 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2796575.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2796575.1).

#### Description

The OpenSSL public API function X509\_issuer\_and\_serial\_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509\_issuer\_and\_serial\_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 497 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [January 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2832416.1).

**Please note that on December 10, 2021, Oracle released a Security Alert for Apache Log4j vulnerabilities [CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2021-44228.html). Customers should review the Alert if they have not already done so.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 7 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.  6 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpujan2022verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the January 2022 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update January 2022 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2817011.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2817011.1).

Package        : openssl
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-1551 CVE-2021-23840 CVE-2021-23841
Debian Bug     : 947949

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure
Sockets Layer toolkit. An overflow bug in the x64_64 Montgomery squaring
procedure, an integer overflow in CipherUpdate and a NULL pointer
dereference flaw X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() were found, which could
result in denial of service.

Additional details can be found in the upstream advisories
<https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20191206.txt> and
<https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20210216.txt> .

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.1d-0+deb10u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.

For the detailed security status of openssl please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openssl>

###### medium

* [Information](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2021-3449)

#### Description

An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature\_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature\_algorithms\_cert extension then a NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack. A server is only vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which is the default configuration). OpenSSL TLS clients are not impacted by this issue. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1j).

#### Description

The X509\_V\_FLAG\_X509\_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a "purpose" has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named "purpose" values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509\_V\_FLAG\_X509\_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected 1.1.1h-1.1.1j).

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 342 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2788740.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 391 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2765149.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.
