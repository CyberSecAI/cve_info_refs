Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2021-23908:

**1. Verification:**

The provided document directly mentions CVE-2021-23908 as one of the vulnerabilities discovered in their research. It also provides some context: "Message Type MultiSvSetAttributes can be used to set the Attributes of Sv... If the new type and the old type are different, a type confusion vulnerability is triggered." This aligns with the official description of CVE-2021-23908 which is a type confusion vulnerability in the `MultiSvSetAttributes` function.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Type confusion in the handling of attributes within the `MultiSvSetAttributes` function of the HiQnet protocol. The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of the data type when modifying an attribute of an Sv (State Variable).

*   **Weakness:** The system allows modification of an Sv attribute with a different type from the original. Specifically, it is possible to set an attribute with a new type and value without any check against the previous type.

*  **Technical Details:**
    *  The vulnerability lies in the function `CHiQnetPayloadMultiSvSetAttributes::SetSVsAttributes`.
    *  When a client uses the `MultiSvSetAttributes` message, the new attribute type is taken from the payload.
    *  If the new type doesn't match the old type, a type confusion vulnerability is triggered.
    * The code will consider a class (e.g., `CSvClassOnOffUByte`) as a different class (e.g., `CSvLong64` or `CSvBlock`) and use the new type's function to process the Sv.
    *   When the new type is 0xA, a heap overflow occurs due to the `CSvLong64::SetDefaultValue` function attempting to write 8 bytes past the original buffer (offset 0x60).
    * When the new type is 0x8, a larger heap overflow occurs via the `CSvBlock::SetDefaultValue` function, allowing the attacker to write arbitrary data with an arbitrary length to adjacent structures.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Heap overflow:** This type confusion leads to a heap overflow because when the data types are misinterpreted,  the system performs an out-of-bounds write.
    * **Arbitrary code execution:** The heap overflow allows an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory structures, including virtual function tables. By overwriting the virtual function table, attackers can gain arbitrary code execution.

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The attacker sends a crafted HiQnet message with the `MultiSvSetAttributes` type.
    *   The payload of the message contains an incorrect attribute type which is different from the original, along with a new value for the attribute.
    *  This malicious message has to be sent through TCP/UDP port 3804.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs access to the head unit's internal network to send HiQnet messages through TCP/UDP port 3804, which is exposed to the CSB (Country Specific Board).
    *  The attacker needs knowledge of the HiQnet protocol and the structure of messages and objects that are to be manipulated.

**3. Additional Information:**

*   The document describes a method to bypass ASLR and achieve arbitrary code execution even without full knowledge of the binary, using a memory leak to discover the addresses of critical function calls from libc and the program itself.
* The report details how a remote code execution vulnerability can lead to control over the head unit, anti-theft bypass, and even vehicle control through CAN messages.
*  The researchers were able to successfully gain a reverse shell on the Linux system with root privileges.
