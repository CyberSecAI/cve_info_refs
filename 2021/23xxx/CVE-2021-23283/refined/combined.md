application is installed and to the application is restricted to legitimate users only. Ensure that the
users are restricted to only the privilege levels necessary to complete their job roles/functions.

General Security Best Practices

•  Restrict exposure to external networks for all control system devices and/or systems and

ensure that they are not directly accessible from the open Internet.

•  Deploy control system networks and remote devices behind barrier devices (e.g. firewalls,

data diodes) and isolate them from business networks.

•  Remote access to control system networks should be made available on a strict need-to-use
basis. Remote access should use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs),
updated to the most current version available.

•  Regularly update/patch software/applications to latest versions available, as applicable.
•  Enable audit logs on all devices and applications.
•  Disable/deactivate unused communication channels, TCP/UDP ports and services (e.g.,

SNMP, FTP, BootP, DHCP, etc.) on networked devices.

•  Create security zones for devices with common security requirements using barrier devices

(e.g. firewalls, data diodes).

•  Change default passwords following initial startup. Use complex secure passwords or

passphrases.

•  Perform regular security assessments and risk analysis of networked control systems.
