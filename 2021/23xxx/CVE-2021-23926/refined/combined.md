## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 419 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2809080.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 38 new security patches for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  30 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html#FMW)

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security updates are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the Critical Patch Update October 2021 to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update October 2021 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2796575.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2796575.1).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : xmlbeans
Version        : 2.6.0+dfsg-1+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-23926

The XML parsers used by XMLBeans did not set the properties needed to protect
the user from malicious XML input. Vulnerabilities include the possibility for
XML Entity Expansion attacks which could lead to a denial-of-service. This
update implements sensible defaults for the XML parsers to prevent these kind
of attacks.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.0+dfsg-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xmlbeans packages.

For the detailed security status of xmlbeans please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/xmlbeans>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 349 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2880220.1).

**Please note that since the release of the April 2022 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released a Security Alert for Oracle E-Business Suite [CVE-2022-21500 (May 19, 2022)](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2022-21500.html). Customers are strongly advised to apply the July 2022 Critical Patch Update for Oracle E-Business Suite, which includes patches for this Alert as well as additional patches.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

# Apache POI™ - the Java API for Microsoft Documents

## Project News

### 8 January 2025 - POI 5.4.0 available

The Apache POI team is pleased to announce the release of 5.4.0.
Several dependencies were updated to their latest versions to pick up security fixes and other improvements.

A summary of changes is available in the
[Release Notes](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/poi/release/RELEASE-NOTES.txt).
A full list of changes is available in the [change log](changes.html#5.4.0).
People interested should also follow the [dev list](help/index.html) to track progress.

See the [downloads](download.html#POI-5.4.0) page for more details.

POI requires Java 8 or newer since version 4.0.1.

### 11 November 2024 - Avoid log4j-api 2.24.1

While testing a potential Apache POI 5.4.0 release, we discovered a serious bug in
log4j-api 2.24.1. This leads to NullPointerExceptions when you use a version of log4j-core that is not of
the exact same version (2.24.1). We recommend that users avoid log4j 2.24.1 and use the latest
2.24.x version where this issue is fixed again.

XMLBeans release 5.2.2 had the problematic log4j-api 2.24.1 dependency and thus
can lead to such issues if used in some other context. In the meantime a version 5.3.0
of XmlBeans was released which avoids this issue.

Please direct any queries to the Log4j Team. The main issue is
[Issue 3143](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/3143).

### 4 March 2022 - CVE-2022-26336 - A carefully crafted TNEF file can cause an out of memory exception in Apache POI poi-scratchpad versions prior to 5.2.0

Description:

A shortcoming in the HMEF package of poi-scratchpad (Apache POI) allows an attacker to cause an Out of Memory exception.
This package is used to read TNEF files (Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange Server).
If an application uses poi-scratchpad to parse TNEF files and the application allows untrusted users to supply them, then a carefully crafted file can cause an Out of Memory exception.

Mitigation:

Affected users are advised to update to poi-scratchpad 5.2.1 or above
which fixes this vulnerability. It is recommended that you use the same versions of all POI jars.

### 10+16+18 December 2021- Log4j vulnerabilities CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046 and CVE-2021-45105

The Apache POI PMC has evaluated the security vulnerabilities reported
for Apache Log4j.

POI 5.1.0 and XMLBeans 5.0.2 only have dependencies on log4j-api 2.14.1.
The security vulnerabilities are not in log4j-api - they are in log4j-core.

If any POI or XMLBeans user uses log4j-core to control their logging of their application,
we strongly recommend that they upgrade all their log4j dependencies to the latest
version (currently v2.20.0) - including log4j-api.

### 13 January 2021 - CVE-2021-23926 - XML External Entity (XXE) Processing in Apache XMLBeans versions prior to 3.0.0

Description:

When parsing XML files using XMLBeans 2.6.0 or below, the underlying parser
created by XMLBeans could be susceptible to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.

This issue was fixed a few years ago but on review, we decided we should have a CVE
to raise awareness of the issue.

Mitigation:

Affected users are advised to update to Apache XMLBeans 3.0.0 or above
which fixes this vulnerability. XMLBeans 4.0.0 or above is preferable.

### 20 October 2019 - CVE-2019-12415 - XML External Entity (XXE) Processing in Apache POI versions prior to 4.1.1

Description:

When using the tool XSSFExportToXml to convert user-provided Microsoft
Excel documents, a specially crafted document can allow an attacker to
read files from the local filesystem or from internal network resources
via XML External Entity (XXE) Processing.

Mitigation:

Apache POI 4.1.0 and before: users who do not use the tool XSSFExportToXml
are not affected. Affected users are advised to update to Apache POI 4.1.1
which fixes this vulnerability.

This issue was discovered by Artem Smotrakov from SAP

### 26 March 2019 - XMLBeans 3.1.0 available

The Apache POI team is pleased to announce the release of XMLBeans 3.1.0.
Featured are a handful of bug fixes.

The Apache POI project has unretired the XMLBeans codebase and is maintaining it as a sub-project,
due to its importance in the poi-ooxml codebase.

A summary of changes is available in the
[Release Notes](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/xmlbeans/trunk/CHANGES.txt?view=markup).
People interested should also follow the [POI dev list](help/index.html) to track progress.

The XMLBeans [JIRA project](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/XMLBEANS) has been reopened and feel free to open issues.

POI 4.1.0 uses XMLBeans 3.1.0.

XMLBeans requires Java 6 or newer since version 3.0.2.

### 11 January 2019 - Initial support for JDK 11

We did some work to verify that compilation with Java 11 is working and
that all unit-tests pass.

See the details in the [FAQ entry](help/faq.html#faq-N102B0).

## Mission Statement

The Apache POI Project's mission is to create and maintain Java APIs for manipulating various file formats
based upon the Office Open XML standards (OOXML) and Microsoft's OLE 2 Compound Document format (OLE2).
In short, you can read and write MS Excel files using Java.
In addition, you can read and write MS Word and MS PowerPoint files using Java. Apache POI is your Java Excel
solution (for Excel 97-2008). We have a complete API for porting other OOXML and OLE2 formats and welcome others to participate.

OLE2 files include most Microsoft Office files such as XLS, DOC, and PPT as well as MFC serialization API based file formats.
The project provides APIs for the [OLE2 Filesystem (POIFS)](components/poifs/) and
[OLE2 Document Properties (HPSF)](components/hpsf/).

Office OpenXML Format is the new standards based XML file format found in Microsoft Office 2007 and 2008.
This includes XLSX, DOCX and PPTX. The project provides a low level API to support the Open Packaging Conventions
using [openxml4j](components/oxml4j/index.html).

For each MS Office application there exists a component module that attempts to provide a common high level Java api to both OLE2 and OOXML
document formats. This is most developed for [Excel workbooks (SS=HSSF+XSSF)](components/spreadsheet/).
Work is progressing for [Word documents (WP=HWPF+XWPF)](components/document/) and
[PowerPoint presentations (SL=HSLF+XSLF)](components/slideshow/).

The project has some support for [Outlook (HSMF)](components/hsmf/index.html). Microsoft opened the specifications
to this format in October 2007. We would welcome contributions.

There are also projects for
[Visio (HDGF and XDGF)](components/diagram/index.html),
[TNEF (HMEF)](components/hmef/index.html),
and [Publisher (HPBF)](components/hpbf/).

As a general policy we collaborate as much as possible with other projects to
provide this functionality. Examples include: [Cocoon](https://xml.apache.org/cocoon) for
which there are serializers for HSSF;
[Open Office.org](https://www.openoffice.org) with whom we collaborate in documenting the
XLS format; and [Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) /
[Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org),
for which we provide format interpretors. When practical, we donate
components directly to those projects for POI-enabling them.

### Why should I use Apache POI?

A major use of the Apache POI api is for [Text Extraction](text-extraction.html) applications
such as web spiders, index builders, and content management systems.

So why should you use POIFS, HSSF or XSSF?

You'd use POIFS if you had a document written in OLE 2 Compound Document Format, probably written using
MFC, that you needed to read in Java. Alternatively, you'd use POIFS to write OLE 2 Compound Document Format
if you needed to inter-operate with software running on the Windows platform. We are not just bragging when
we say that POIFS is the most complete and correct implementation of this file format to date!

You'd use HSSF if you needed to read or write an Excel file using Java (XLS). You'd use
XSSF if you need to read or write an OOXML Excel file using Java (XLSX). The combined
SS interface allows you to easily read and write all kinds of Excel files (XLS and XLSX)
using Java. Additionally there is a specialized SXSSF implementation which allows to write
very large Excel (XLSX) files in a memory optimized way.

### Components

The Apache POI Project provides several component modules some of which may not be of interest to you.
Use the information on our [Components](components/) page to determine which
jar files to include in your classpath.
