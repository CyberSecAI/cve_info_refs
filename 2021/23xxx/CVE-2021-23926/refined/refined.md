{
  "CVE-2021-23926": {
    "Description": "The XML parsers used by XMLBeans did not set the properties needed to protect the user from malicious XML input. Vulnerabilities include the possibility for XML Entity Expansion attacks which could lead to a denial-of-service.",
    "Root cause": "Improper configuration of XML parsers used by XMLBeans leading to XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "Disclosure of sensitive information or Denial of Service (DoS) via XML entity expansion.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker must be able to send malicious XML input to the vulnerable service or product.",
	"Additional Information": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper security configurations on the XML parsers used by XMLBeans. This can lead to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, potentially causing information disclosure or denial of service via entity expansion. The fix involves setting sensible defaults for the XML parsers to prevent such attacks, and the recommended mitigation involves upgrading to Apache XMLBeans 3.0.0 or above."
