Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-23434

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a type confusion issue in how the `object-path` library handles path components when they are arrays.
- Specifically, when the code checks for the `__proto__` property using the strict equality operator (`===`), it fails when the provided path component is an array like `['__proto__']` because the types are different, thus bypassing the intended security check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject or modify properties on the `Object.prototype`, affecting all JavaScript objects.
- **Type Confusion:** The use of the strict equality operator (`===`) leads to a bypass of security checks when path components are arrays, because `['__proto__'] === '__proto__'` evaluates to false.
- **Bypass of CVE-2020-15256 Fix:** This vulnerability bypasses the fix implemented for a previous prototype pollution vulnerability (CVE-2020-15256) in the same library.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting `Object.prototype` with unexpected values or functions, an attacker can cause JavaScript exceptions, leading to a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In scenarios where the code evaluates attributes of objects (e.g., using `eval`), an attacker could inject malicious code via prototype pollution.
- **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject or modify existing properties of objects, which may lead to privilege escalation or unauthorized access to sensitive information (cookies, tokens, etc.).

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can control the `path` parameter passed to the `set` function or similar functions in the `object-path` library.
- By providing an array as a path component, such as `[['__proto__'], 'someProperty']`, they can bypass the checks designed to prevent prototype pollution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input of the `path` parameter when calling functions in `object-path`.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of `object-path` prior to 0.11.6 (for npm package) or 0.11.8 (for maven package).
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) is provided which demonstrates how the `set` function can be used to pollute the prototype.
- The vulnerability can be triggered both using standard `set` function or the `withInheritedProps` variant.
- The fix involves ensuring that all path components are converted to strings before checks against `__proto__` etc.

This vulnerability is a client-side issue which can affect application servers, web servers and web browsers.
