{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists in the implementation of the QuickClean feature of McAfee Total Protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application is susceptible to a denial-of-service vulnerability through the abuse of directory junctions. Specifically, an attacker can create a directory junction that, when processed by the QuickClean feature, results in the deletion of an arbitrary file, leading to a denial-of-service condition.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service condition on the affected system due to the deletion of critical files.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access to the system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. They also need the ability to create directory junctions."
