- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `stat` function in the `roar-pidusage` package uses the `child_process.exec` function without sanitizing user input. This allows for arbitrary command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary command injection via unsanitized user input.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system. The provided PoC demonstrates creation of a file but more malicious commands can be executed.
- **Attack vectors**: User-controlled input is passed to the `stat` function, which executes a command using `child_process.exec`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to control the input passed to the `stat` function of the vulnerable package. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable at the network level. No privileges or user interaction is required for the attack.
