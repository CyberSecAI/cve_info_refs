Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-23401

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `make_safe_url` function in `flask_user/user_manager__utils.py` fails to properly sanitize URLs, allowing attackers to bypass URL validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Open Redirect:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to redirect a user to an arbitrary URL by manipulating the input provided to the `make_safe_url` function.
- **Insufficient URL Sanitization:** The function does not adequately handle multiple backslashes (`\`) or forward slashes (`/`) in the URL, which can be used to bypass the intended URL sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can redirect users to malicious websites, potentially leading to phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other harmful activities.
- The vulnerability can be used to gain access to sensitive information or to conduct other malicious activities by redirecting a user to a fake login page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must be able to influence the input provided to the `make_safe_url` function, which is called when constructing redirect URLs.
- The attacker provides a malicious URL with multiple backslashes or forward slashes, such as `/////evil.com/path` or `\\\evil.com/path`.
- The victim must click on the crafted malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs to initiate the redirect.
- User interaction is required as the victim needs to click the crafted malicious link.
- The vulnerability is only exploitable if an alternative WSGI server other than `Werkzeug` is used, or the default behaviour of `Werkzeug` is modified using `autocorrect_location_header=False`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the `flask-user` package.
- There is no fixed version for this vulnerability at the time of the report.
- The vulnerability is assigned a medium severity score.
- The probability of exploitation in the wild is low (0.1%, 44th percentile according to EPSS).
