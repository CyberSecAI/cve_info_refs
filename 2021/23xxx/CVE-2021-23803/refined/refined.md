{
  "CVE-2021-23803": {
    "Description": "There is a way to bypass `allowFunctions` that will affect the security of the application. When the template is set to allow/disallow the use of certain functions, adding control characters (x00-x08) after the function will bypass these restrictions.",
    "Root cause": "The template engine did not properly sanitize function names, allowing control characters to bypass restrictions set by `allowFunctions`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Access Control Bypass",
       "Improper Input Validation",
      "CWE-863"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could execute arbitrary PHP functions that are not explicitly allowed, leading to potential remote code execution, data compromise, and denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "By inserting control characters (x00-x08) after a function name within a Latte template.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to control the content of a Latte template being processed by the vulnerable application. No authentication is needed."
