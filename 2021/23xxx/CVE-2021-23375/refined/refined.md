- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `kill` function in the `psnode` library uses the `child_process.exec` function without sanitizing user-provided input, leading to command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system where the vulnerable code is running. The provided PoC creates a file, but any other command could be executed, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Attacker-controlled input is passed to the vulnerable `kill` function. Specifically, input given as a process name to kill is passed unsanitized to the `exec` command
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to control the input provided to the `kill` function. No other privileges are required.
