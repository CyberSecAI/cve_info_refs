Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-23958:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the browser's incorrect handling of screen-sharing state when a tab is closed. Specifically, the browser could prematurely blur or hide the closing tab, and briefly show the content of the next active tab, while still sharing the screen. This creates a small window of opportunity to capture the content of the next tab.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Screen Sharing State Transfer:** The core issue is the improper transfer of the screen-sharing state between tabs during a close action. The browser incorrectly continues capturing the screen for a brief period after the sharing tab is closed, which includes content from the next tab that becomes active.
*   **Timing Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is timing-dependent, meaning the exploit relies on a brief window of opportunity after a tab is closed. This makes reliable reproduction difficult but doesn't eliminate the risk.
*   **Privacy Violation:** The primary risk is the unauthorized disclosure of information from one tab to another by capturing the content of the wrong tab.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The most significant impact is the leakage of potentially sensitive information from the tab that becomes active after the screen-sharing tab is closed. This could expose private data, user activities, or other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker would need a malicious web page that initiates a screen-sharing session.
*   **Tab Closing Event:** The attacker would then have the victim close the screen-sharing tab while another tab is in the foreground.
*   **Screen Capture:** The attacker uses JavaScript to capture screen content and exfiltrate the content of another tab by exploiting the short window during which the screen share is still active but the sharing tab has been closed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Initiate Screen Sharing:** An attacker needs to create a web page that can trigger the screen-sharing feature of the browser.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user into initiating screen sharing and closing a tab.
*   **JavaScript Execution:** The attacker's web page needs to execute JavaScript to capture the screen content at the correct moment.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is fixed by preventing the premature blurring of closing tabs involved in screen sharing.
*   **Intermittent Issue:** The bug is noted as being intermittent, which means the exploit may not work every time, but it is still a risk.
*   **Not an ESR uplift:** The fix was not considered for an uplift to the ESR version of Firefox.

In summary, CVE-2021-23958 is a moderate-severity privacy vulnerability stemming from improper management of screen-sharing state during tab closure, potentially leaking content from adjacent tabs.
