Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-23219:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the internal microcontroller of NVIDIA GPUs and Tegra hardware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability allows an attacker with elevated privileges to access protected information by exploiting and loading vulnerable microcode.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may lead to information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is local (AV:L).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker requires OS administrative/kernel rights (PR:H) and has to have a high level of access (AC:H), with no user interaction required (UI:N). The scope of impact is unchanged (S:U).

**Affected Products:**
*   Maxwell (except GM206)
*   Tegra X1
*   Tegra X1+

**Note:**
*   Ampere products are not affected.
*   In an environment where the GPU is virtualized (for example, vGPU), the vulnerability is not exploitable.
*   If the hypervisor is compromised or there is direct GPU access with bare metal or pass-through, Turing, Volta, Pascal, or Maxwell products can be exposed.
