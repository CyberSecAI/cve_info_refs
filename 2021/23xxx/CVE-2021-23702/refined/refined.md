Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23702:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a Prototype Pollution issue within the `object-extend` package. The `object-extend` library is susceptible to prototype pollution due to unsafe recursive merge logic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The library's merge function allows an attacker to inject properties into the `Object.prototype` via the `__proto__` property. This is achieved through unsafe recursive merging when a source object contains a `__proto__` property.
- **Unsafe Recursive Merge:** The merge function recursively copies properties from a source object to a target object. It does not properly validate or sanitize the property names during this merge process which allows an attacker to inject `__proto__` and modify the prototype of `Object` by injecting new properties or modifying existing ones.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By altering properties like `toString` or `valueOf` on `Object.prototype`, the application might crash or behave unexpectedly when these functions are used.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the application evaluates a property from an object and an attacker can control the value of this property by polluting the `Object.prototype` with malicious values, it may be possible to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Property Injection:** By injecting properties into the prototype, an attacker can potentially manipulate the application logic.  For example by setting an `isAdmin` property to true on the `Object.prototype` , an attacker may achieve admin privileges.
- **Information Disclosure:** Although not directly mentioned, information disclosure could occur if an attacker pollutes a property that is relied upon for its informative value.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through manipulating the input of the `object-extend` function to include a `__proto__` property with a malicious payload.
- Any data that is merged using `object-extend` could potentially be an attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to influence the input to the `object-extend` function.  This could be through client-side code or by controlling the data that is merged within the application.
- No specific user interaction is required

**Additional Details:**

- The Snyk article provides a detailed explanation of prototype pollution, including examples of how it can be exploited.
- It explains the two main ways prototype pollution occurs (unsafe object merge and property definition by path), although this specific vulnerability is caused by the unsafe object merge.
- It lists different types of attacks possible by prototype pollution (DoS, RCE, and property injection).
- It discusses prevention techniques, such as freezing the prototype, schema validation, and using `Map` instead of `Object`.
- It includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability with `__proto__`.
- It provides CVSS scores, indicating a high severity (7.6 by Snyk and 9.8 by NVD).
