Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23384:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `removeTrailingSlashes()` function within the `koa-remove-trailing-slashes` middleware. It improperly handles URLs containing multiple trailing slashes by using a relative redirect instead of an absolute one.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Open Redirect:** The middleware redirects users based on the input URL. When a URL with multiple trailing slashes like `https://example.com///attacker.example/` is provided, it results in a redirect to `attacker.example` because it's treated as relative.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious URL with multiple trailing slashes, causing the application to redirect users to an arbitrary, attacker-controlled domain. This can be used for phishing attacks, session hijacking, or other malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via a network connection.
- The attacker manipulates the URL by inserting multiple trailing slashes before a malicious domain in the URL path.
- The user needs to click on the malicious link or otherwise interact with the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- No privileges are needed to execute the attack, and no special user action is needed besides clicking on the link.

**Additional Details:**
- The proof-of-concept (PoC) code provides an easy way to reproduce the vulnerability. It shows a basic Koa server using the middleware that is vulnerable.
- The vulnerability affects versions of `koa-remove-trailing-slashes` prior to 2.0.2.
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-601 (URL Redirection to Untrusted Site).
