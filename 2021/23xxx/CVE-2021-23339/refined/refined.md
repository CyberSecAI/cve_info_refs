- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the affected versions of `com.typesafe.akka:akka-http-core` allowing multiple `Transfer-Encoding` headers in HTTP requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** HTTP Request Smuggling due to improper handling of multiple `Transfer-Encoding` headers. This is related to CWE-444, Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially smuggle requests by exploiting the inconsistent interpretation of the `Transfer-Encoding` header, which could lead to various impacts including but not limited to:
    - Confidentiality: Access to some restricted information is obtained, though the attacker does not have fine-grained control over what information is obtained.
    - Integrity: Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the extent of modification.
    - Availability: Reduced performance or interruptions in resource availability can occur.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can be remote.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any prior authorization. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability and the attack complexity is rated as high, requiring effort in preparation or execution.
