Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The `x-assign` package is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to an unsafe recursive merge function in its `assign` method. This function doesn't properly sanitize or validate input, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the `Object.prototype`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unsafe Recursive Merge:** The `assign` function recursively merges objects without proper checks, allowing the `__proto__` property to be modified if it exists in the source object.
- **Prototype Pollution:** By manipulating the `__proto__` property, an attacker can modify the prototype of all JavaScript objects, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential security issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting properties like `toString` or `valueOf` on the `Object.prototype`, an attacker can cause JavaScript exceptions and lead to a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In specific scenarios where the code evaluates an object's attribute and executes it (e.g., using `eval`), an attacker can inject malicious code.
- **Property Injection:** Attackers can manipulate properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security-related properties (e.g., user privileges).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a malicious input object with the `__proto__` property during the merge operation of the `x-assign` function

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to control the input provided to the `x-assign` function.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the `x-assign` package, and no fix is available as of the provided information.
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates how an attacker can pollute the prototype by injecting a `polluted` property.
