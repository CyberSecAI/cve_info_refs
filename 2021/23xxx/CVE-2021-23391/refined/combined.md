## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `calipso`.

## Overview

[calipso](https://github.com/cliftonc/calipso) is a Calipso is a simple NodeJS content management system based on Express, Connect & Mongoose.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (Zip Slip). It is possible for a malicious module to overwrite files on an arbitrary file system through the module install functionality.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.3 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker's path is via read/write/execute capabilities.

  **Local**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**

## Calipso

Calipso is a simple NodeJS content management system, built along
similar themes to Drupal and Wordpress, that is designed to be fast,
flexible and simple.

For additional details, including installation instructions, please
visit the home page: [http://calip.so/](http://calip.so/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=calipso&utm_campaign=github)

If you would like to contribute, please take a look at the issues list
as this will have the most up to date view of work that needs to be done
for the next minor release. Otherwise, please just pm myself (cliftonc),
dennis (dennishall) or dale (dtan) and we can suggest some places for
you to start.

[![Build Status](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/59f8c81a0290503423ce6d446b90052197a02142b73a431360a756b95f9bdd8a/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f636c6966746f6e632f63616c6970736f2e706e67)](https://travis-ci.org/cliftonc/calipso)

### Quick Install

If you want to try it out as quickly as possible, please install
MongoDB, ensure that you have the right compilers installed (for OSX,
XCode4 will work, for Ubuntu, the build-essential and libssl-dev
packages) and then use NPM:

```
        npm install calipso -g
        calipso site /var/www/MySite
        cd /var/www/MySite
        calipso server
```

Note the server will output an installation password during install to prevent
some other person from installing your server.
The output will look something like this:

```
Installation Password: "5ng/joSjSXS9RsERDXVGk40Ih2PP5YC/7w==" (inside quotes)

```

#### NOTE: Mongoose upgraded to 3.6.x

This causes the sort api to change. In order to run under SmartOS mongoose had to be upgraded
to in turn upgrade mongodb to 1.3.x.
When sorting rather than

```
query.sort('column', 1).sort('column2', -1)
```

Use

```
query.sort('column -column2')
```

Instead.

#### Using environment variables

The site will respond to a environment variable called MONGO\_URI. If MONGO\_URI is set
then the configuration storage will move from the /conf folder into the mongodb database
pointed to by the MONGO\_URI. This allows easy deployment of a calipso site to a nodejs
hosting provider. To re-install or install, calipso will ask for an installation password
which is a randomly generated string which will be logged to your log file.
Copy this string and paste it into the UI to proceed. The system will overwrite and adjust
the username/password your specify for the admin which previously was a little bit of a problem.
To "re-install" use your mongo command shell to update the settings in the database as follows:

```
db.confs.update({environment:'development'},{$set:{"configuration.installed":false}})
```

or

```
db.confs.update({environment:'production'},{$set:{"configuration.installed":false}})
```

#### Using node v0.5.3 and later

Since node v0.5.3 has removed `require.paths`, in order to
`require(‘lib/calipso’)`, you must include the following to
your file:

```
var rootpath = process.cwd() + '/',
  path = require('path'),
  calipso = require(path.join(rootpath, 'lib/calipso'));
```

```
That also goes for including anything that is based on the root path of the project directory.

```

### Development Steps

```
To get running in development mode (not the site mode outlined on the front page) - e.g. so you can make changes to core and submit pull requests:

1.  Fork the repository
2.  Clone from your fork (replace YOURNAME!): git clone git@github.com:YOURNAME/calipso.git
3.  Run 'npm install -d' in the clone folder to install all of the dependencies.
4.  Run 'node app' to run Calipso from the source folder.

Note that the bin/calipso command line script is really designed to allow people who just want to use Calipso to build sites to use it, it isn't used in the dev process.  As always, any questions please do shout.

```

### Calipso Command Line Client

```
The commands currently supported from the command line client are:

```

#### Commands That Run Anywhere

```
        calipso                            : Show this help file.
        calipso site <name|folder>         : Create site in folder.
```

#### Commands That Run In Site Folder

The most important of these at the moment is ‘modules check’ (this will
ensure that all modules have all of their dependencies installed via
npm), and should be run on site install.

```
        calipso install                    : Re-run site install.

        calipso cluster --port=3000        : Run as cluster.
        calipso server --port=3000         : Run as a single server.

        calipso modules list               : List installed modules.
        calipso modules check              : Check installation of all modules.
        calipso modules install *mod@ver   : Install module@version, or reinstall module.
        calipso modules download github    : Download module from github (e.g. cliftonc/calipso-elastic)
        calipso modules enable *mod        : Enable module.
        calipso modules disable *mod       : Disable module.

        calipso themes list                : List installed themes.
        calipso themes uninstall *theme    : Remove theme (delete from disk)
        calipso themes download *url       : Download (url: http://, gh: cliftonc/calipso-site-theme, repo: calipso-site).
```
