Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23391:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction, also known as a "Zip Slip" vulnerability. This occurs during the module install process within the `calipso` package.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The `calipso` application does not properly validate filenames within a downloaded archive (specifically ZIP files). When extracting the archive, it's possible to use relative path names (e.g., `../../../../../../tmp/foo.txt`) to write files outside the intended module directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can overwrite existing files or create new files on the server's filesystem.
*   **Code Execution (potential):** By writing malicious files, an attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution if they can overwrite or create files that are executed by the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Module Download:** An attacker crafts a malicious module in a ZIP archive, which contains files with path traversal sequences in their names.
*   **Module Installation:** The attacker uses the `calipso modules download` command to download the malicious module. This process triggers the vulnerable archive extraction code, which extracts the malicious module content to arbitrary file system locations.
*   **Command-Line Utility:** The vulnerability is exploited through the `calipso` command-line utility, which has a modules download feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not need any prior access or special privileges on the system.
*   **Ability to Supply a Malicious ZIP Archive URL:** The attacker must be able to provide a URL pointing to a malicious ZIP file.
*   **Local Access (as per CVSS):** The Snyk analysis indicates the vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack, but requires read/write/execute capabilities to the local machine.
* **User interaction is not required:** The user does not need to do anything to trigger the vulnerability other than execute the vulnerable calipso command.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** A PoC is provided, demonstrating the download of an `evil.zip` archive and the resulting arbitrary file write to `/tmp/foo.txt`.
*   **Exploit Maturity:** Snyk indicates that a published code exploit is available.
*   **No Fix:** The content mentions there is no fixed version for `calipso`, indicating that the vulnerability remains unpatched in the last available version.
*   **CVSS Metrics:**
    *   Snyk: CVSS v3.1 score of 7.3 (High)
    *   NVD: CVSS v3.1 score of 7.1 (High)

**Summary:**
The vulnerability in `calipso` allows an attacker to write arbitrary files to the system by exploiting the archive extraction functionality during module installation. The attacker does this by providing a malicious ZIP archive that uses path traversal to write outside of the module install directory. The vulnerability is exploitable without any privileges and can lead to significant consequences if the attacker is able to overwrite files that cause code execution on the system.
