    "summary": "The provided content describes CVE-2021-23449, a sandbox escape vulnerability in the `vm2` npm package. The vulnerability is caused by a prototype pollution attack vector, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the host machine. The vulnerability is present in `vm2` versions prior to 3.9.4.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a result of a Prototype Pollution attack vector. Specifically, it involves the manipulation of `__proto__` attributes of JavaScript objects to overwrite or pollute an application's object prototype, potentially leading to remote code execution.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Prototype Pollution vulnerability in JavaScript",
         "Unsafe handling of Object recursive merge",
         "Property definition by path can be manipulated to alter the prototype chain of objects"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to:\n   - Disclosure of sensitive information\n   - Addition or modification of data\n   - Denial of Service (DoS)\n   - Execution of arbitrary code on the host machine",
      "attack_vectors": [
         "Network: The vulnerable component is network accessible, allowing attackers from the entire internet to attempt exploitation.",
        "Prototype Pollution via:\n    - Unsafe Object recursive merge\n    - Property definition by path"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not require any prior authorization or privileges to exploit the vulnerability and can interact with the vulnerable system without user interaction.",
        "remediation": "Upgrade `vm2` to version 3.9.4 or higher.\n Additionally, consider the following mitigation measures:\n    - Freeze the prototype using `Object.freeze (Object.prototype)`.\n    - Require schema validation of JSON input.\n    - Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.\n   - Use objects without prototypes (e.g., `Object.create(null)`).\n   - Use `Map` instead of `Object`."
