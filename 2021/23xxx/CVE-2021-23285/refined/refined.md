- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient validation of input from certain resources by the IPM Infrastructure software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser session. This could lead to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions. The impact is rated as low for confidentiality and integrity, with no impact on availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack requires local subnet access and administrator interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the local subnet and would require some level of administrator interaction to compromise the system.
