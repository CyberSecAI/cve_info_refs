Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-23207:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Plaintext storage of a password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The system stores secrets in plaintext within the registry. This allows an attacker with physical access to the host to extract these secrets.
*   The extracted secrets can be used to create valid JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for the Fresenius Kabi Vigilant MasterMed application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can impersonate arbitrary users on the system.
*   An attacker can manipulate RabbitMQ queues and messages.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Physical access to the host running the vulnerable software is required to extract the plaintext passwords from the registry.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have physical access to the host machine where the vulnerable Fresenius Kabi Vigilant MasterMed application is installed.
*   The attacker must also have sufficient knowledge to extract the secrets from the registry and create valid JWT tokens.
