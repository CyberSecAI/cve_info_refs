The provided content is related to CVE-2021-23995.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the use of references to objects that were previously freed when Responsive Design Mode was enabled in Firefox. Specifically, `gfxFontGroup` had a `FontMatchingStats` reference from a deleted `presContext`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: The code was accessing memory that had already been deallocated.
- Improper caching: The `CanvasRenderingContext2D` was holding onto `gfxFontGroup` references in its `ContextState` stack, without properly checking if the associated `FontMatchingStats` was still valid.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The vulnerability could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited successfully.

**Attack vectors:**
- Enabling Responsive Design Mode via `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `M` after visiting a malicious webpage that triggers the use-after-free.
- The exploit requires a specific sequence of actions, including toggling the responsive design mode, which offers some mitigation, but other scenarios may exist.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to lure the victim to visit a malicious webpage.
- The attacker needs to induce the victim to toggle the Responsive Design Mode on and off.
