## Credits

**elFinder.NetCore** is based on my [fork](https://github.com/gordon-matt/elFinder.Net) of [elFinder.Net](https://github.com/leniel/elFinder.Net) by Leniel Macaferi which itself was based on an [older version](https://github.com/EvgenNoskov/Elfinder.NET) by Yevhen Noskov, which as far as I can tell is the original.

Many thanks also to [Flavio Smirne](https://github.com/fsmirne) for the excellent contribution of an Azure Storage driver and the work done to allow such extensibility.

## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `elFinder.NetCore`.

## Overview

[elFinder.NetCore](https://github.com/gordon-matt/elFinder.NetCore) is a file manager for Web.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal. The `Path.Combine(...)` method is used to create an absolute file path. Due to missing sanitation of the user input and a missing check of the generated path its possible to escape the `Files` directory via path traversal

### PoC

```
* git clone https://github.com/gordon-matt/elFinder.NetCore.git
* cd ./elFinder.NetCore/elFinder.NetCore.Web/
* libman restore
* export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
* dotnet run
* go to https://localhost:5001/file-manager
Rightlick on one of the example files and click `Rename`. Rename the file to `../Mountains.jpg`
(This should result in a get request to the URL: https://localhost:5001/el-finder/file-system/connector?cmd=rename&name=..%2Fevil.jpg&target=v1_L01vdW50YWlucy5qcGc1&_=1624303958535)
* Due to the directory traversal vulnerability the file was stored outside of the `Files` directory, and inside the web server root dir `wwwroot`.

```
## Details

A Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with "dot-dot-slash (../)" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.

Directory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:

* **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.

`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Ast%3A20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.

If an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.

```
curl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa

```

**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).

* **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`.

One way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.

The following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:

```
2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt
2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

8.6 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**
