Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23428:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `Path.Combine(...)` to create absolute file paths without proper sanitization of user input or validation of the generated path, which allows for directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Directory Traversal (CWE-22):** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw that allows an attacker to access files and directories outside the intended "Files" directory.
- **Missing Input Sanitization:** User-provided input used in file path construction is not properly sanitized.
- **Missing Path Validation:** The constructed file path is not checked to ensure it remains within the intended directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** Attackers can write files to arbitrary locations within the web server's file system, potentially overwriting existing files. This is demonstrated in the provided proof of concept, where a file is written to the `wwwroot` directory, which is outside the intended `Files` directory.
- **Potential for Code Execution:** Overwriting sensitive files like configuration files or executables with malicious content can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Information Disclosure:** While not directly shown in the provided PoC, the directory traversal vulnerability could also potentially be used to read files outside of the intended directory, leaking sensitive information such as application source code or configuration files.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited through crafted HTTP requests by manipulating the `name` parameter of the `rename` command. This parameter is used to construct the target file path. By including `../` sequences, an attacker can navigate up the directory tree.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server and manipulate the input parameters. No authentication is needed.
- The attacker needs to know the path structure of the server and where to place or overwrite files.

**Additional Details from Snyk:**

- Snyk provides a detailed CVSS score of 8.6 (high), classifying the attack vector as network, with low complexity, no required privileges, and no user interaction needed.
- They classify the confidentiality impact as high, and both integrity and availability impacts as low.
- Snyk also notes that there is a published exploit for this vulnerability.
- The PoC provided shows that by manipulating the rename command, a user can write files outside of the intended directory.

**Additional Details from Github:**

- The Github page hosts the vulnerable code.
- The relevant code for this vulnerability is in the `elFinder.NetCore/Drivers/FileSystem/FileSystemDriver.cs#L387`

The information provided gives a good picture of the vulnerability, its root cause, impact, and how it could be exploited, which aligns with the description of CVE-2021-23428 as a directory traversal vulnerability.
