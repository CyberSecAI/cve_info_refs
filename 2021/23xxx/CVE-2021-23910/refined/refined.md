  "vulnerability_information": {
    "related_to_cve": true,
    "root_cause": "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the RemoteDiagnosisApp process on the T-Box due to insufficient bounds checking when processing messages from the SH2A MCU. The RemoteDiagnosisApp registers channel 10 with the blockIpcServer and when parsing the payload of channel 10 sent by the SH2A MCU and transferred by the blockIpcServer, there is an array OOB read vulnerability in function `get_ovci_chn`. The size of the array `chn_table` is 88. Therefore, if the argument `idx` is above 88, an out-of-bounds read occurs. The function returns a channel index based on data outside of this array. Then, the `ovci_data` is stored in the `ovci_data_area` array, resulting in an out-of-bounds write.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Out-of-bounds write",
      "Insufficient bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "Memory corruption. An attacker could potentially overwrite data in memory, leading to denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted message sent from the SH2A MCU to the T-Box's Linux system through the serial interface `/dev/ttyAMA1`. This message contains a payload that causes out-of-bounds access when processed by the RemoteDiagnosisApp.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need to have control over the SH2A MCU (which requires compromising the T-Box's Linux system or having a debug version of the device) to send a malicious message to the RemoteDiagnosisApp process. They would also need to know the format of channel 10's payload, which is described in the report."
