Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an unsafe recursive merge function within the `@cookiex/deep` library. This function doesn't properly sanitize or validate the keys of the input objects during a merge operation, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the `Object.prototype`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is prototype pollution, where an attacker can modify the prototype of built-in JavaScript objects (like `Object`) by injecting properties using the `__proto__` key.
- **Unsafe Recursive Merge:** The library's recursive merge logic iterates over keys of source objects and merges them into target objects. When a source object contains a `__proto__` key, the merge operation will recurse on the prototype of the target object and the provided source, leading to property injection into `Object.prototype`.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The vulnerable code lacks input validation, allowing attacker-controlled input to modify object prototypes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the prototype with unexpected values, attackers can cause JavaScript exceptions and crashes, resulting in denial of service. For example, if the `toString` method of the `Object.prototype` is overwritten, it can cause runtime errors when the `toString` method of any object is invoked.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In scenarios where the codebase evaluates attributes of objects and then executes them (e.g., via `eval`), attackers can inject malicious code into the prototype, potentially achieving RCE.
- **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject arbitrary properties into the prototype chain. This could include security-relevant attributes such as cookies or tokens and potentially compromise security measures, resulting in unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulated Input:** The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted JSON object containing a `__proto__` key to the vulnerable `deep.default` function of the `@cookiex/deep` library.
- **Recursive Merge:** By providing the payload, the vulnerable recursive merge logic merges properties onto the `Object.prototype` through the `__proto__` property.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to pass a controlled JSON object to the vulnerable `deep.default` function. This could be done by manipulating user input, or controlling external data that is used by the vulnerable code.
- No specific privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Jayateertha Guruprasad.
- The fix was implemented by blocking the `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype` keys.
- The vulnerability exists in versions of `@cookiex/deep` prior to 0.0.7.
