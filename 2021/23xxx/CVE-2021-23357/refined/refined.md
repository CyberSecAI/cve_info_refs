{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `handleAddOrUpdateApi` function in the Tyk Gateway allows for directory traversal by using user-provided input (`APIID`) directly in file paths, enabling deletion or modification of arbitrary JSON files on the host where Tyk is running.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can delete or modify any JSON file on the Tyk host by providing a crafted `APIID` containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`). This can lead to data loss, service disruption, or modification of configurations.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited via the management API where an attacker can create an API with a malicious `APIID`.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to make requests to the management API of the Tyk gateway. Low privileges are needed, but user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was introduced on November 19, 2020. The report also notes that the recommended fix is to not use user-defined input as part of file names, and suggests maintaining a mapping between apiIDs and a gateway generated file name (e.g., a UUID). The CVSS scores differ between Snyk and NVD: Snyk: 3.3 (low), NVD: 5.3 (medium). Snyk classifies the attack vector as local and NVD classifies it as network."
