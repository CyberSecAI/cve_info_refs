### Threat Intelligence

EPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.
Check out the EPSS
[documentation](https://www.first.org/epss/articles/prob_percentile_bins)
for more details.

## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk/gateway`.

## Overview

[github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk/gateway](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk) is a Tyk Gateway API

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal via the `handleAddOrUpdateApi` function.

This function is able to delete arbitrary JSON files on the disk where `Tyk` is running via the management API. The `APIID` is provided by the user and this value is then used to create a file on disk. If there is a file found with the same name then it will be deleted and then re-created with the contents of the API creation request.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

3.3 low

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker's path is via read/write/execute capabilities.

  **Local**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker requires privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges has the ability to access only non-sensitive resources.

  **Low**
* User Interaction (UI)

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. For example, a successful exploit may only be possible during the installation of an application by a system administrator.

  **Required**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

| **Branch/Environment/Version**   * Branch/Version: <https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk/tree/v3.0.1> * Environment: On-Prem, Linux   **Describe the bug** The function at <https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk/blob/v3.0.1/gateway/api.go#L771> is able to delete arbitrary JSON files on disk where Tyk is running via the management API. The APIID is provided by the user and this value is then used to create a file on disk. If there is a file found with the same name then it will be deleted and then re-created with the contents of the API creation request.  Assume I create an API with APIID="../../something" - if there is a JSON file at that location called something.json, it will be deleted and replaced with the API definition object from my request.  This means 2 things:   * Actors are able to traverse the file system of the Tyk host * Actors are able to delete and modify any JSON file on the Tyk host   **Reproduction steps**   * Create a file outside of where Tyk is storing the API definitions eg ../something.json * Make a request to create an API with APIID '../something' * Observe file get deleted and then overwritten   **Actual behavior** Tyk deletes/modifies arbitrary JSON files  **Expected behavior** Tyk should not use user defined input as part of file names. Recommended that the API gateway maintains a mapping between apiIDs and a gateway generated FileName i.e. a UUID.  **Screenshots/Video** N/A  **Logs (debug mode or log file):** N/A  **Configuration (tyk config file):** N/A  **Additional context** N/A |
