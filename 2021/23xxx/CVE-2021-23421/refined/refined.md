- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `utils.set` function in the `merge-change` package is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to unsafe recursive merging and property definition by path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The package uses an unsafe recursive merge function and allows property definition by path, which an attacker can exploit by injecting properties into the `Object.prototype`. This includes setting `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype` properties, potentially overwriting existing properties on the prototype chain.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
    - Denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions if crucial prototype methods such as `toString` or `valueOf` are overwritten.
    - Remote code execution if the application evaluates a polluted object property using `eval` or similar functions.
    - Property injection, where the attacker pollutes properties the codebase relies on for informative value, potentially including security properties, leading to privilege escalation or other unwanted behavior.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Unsafe object recursive merge: When merging objects, a specially crafted source object containing a `__proto__` property can be used to inject properties into the `Object.prototype`.
    - Property definition by path: By controlling the path parameter, an attacker can set properties on the prototype using paths like `__proto__.myValue`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the vulnerable `merge` function or the function that sets the value based on a given path. This can be achieved by providing malicious JSON data or manipulating the request parameters if the library is used to handle user input. The attack is remotely exploitable via the network, requiring no user interaction or privileges. The attacker requires some measurable effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component.
