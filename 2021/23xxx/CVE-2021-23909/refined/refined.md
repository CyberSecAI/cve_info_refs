  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The SH2A firmware processes messages from the host without checking the length field in the payload, resulting in a stack overflow when the memcpy() function copies data with a considerable length.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Stack overflow in SH2A firmware due to missing length check when processing message payload."
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the SH2A chip of the T-Box. This allows attackers to transmit arbitrary CAN messages on the CAN bus and also bypass the code signing mechanism in order to flash a custom SH2A MCU firmware.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Compromising the T-Box's Linux system and sending a crafted message with a large payload through the serial port to the SH2A chip.",
        "Exploitation of a vulnerable process in T-Box that passes data to the SH2A chip."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to gain code execution on the T-Box's Linux system first. This vulnerability was triggered on a development version of the T-Box hardware with debug shell enabled. Once code execution is achieved on the T-Box OS, the attacker needs to send a specially crafted message via serial to the SH2A chip to trigger the stack overflow vulnerability. The SH2A processor has direct CAN bus access. \n\n\n\n"
