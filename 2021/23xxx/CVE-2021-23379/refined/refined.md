- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `portkiller` package uses the `child_process.exec` function without sanitizing user-controlled input, allowing for arbitrary command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary command injection vulnerability (CWE-77).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system where the vulnerable package is used.
- **Attack vectors:** By providing specially crafted input to the `portkiller` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to control the input passed to the `portkiller` function. This can be through user-provided data. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable at the protocol level via the network.
