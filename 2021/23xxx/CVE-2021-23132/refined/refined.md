- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the `com_media` component, allowing paths not intended for image uploads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of file paths during upload operations in `com_media`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially upload files to locations outside the intended image directories, possibly leading to arbitrary file uploads or other unintended consequences.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `com_media` component, specifically during upload operations.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker likely needs to be an authorized user with permissions to upload files using the `com_media` component.
