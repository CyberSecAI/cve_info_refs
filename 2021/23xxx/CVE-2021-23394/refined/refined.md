Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of `.phar` files in elFinder. Specifically, the server, when configured to parse `.phar` files as PHP, allows for the execution of arbitrary PHP code contained within these files. This is due to a missing MIME type mapping for `.phar` files in the `staticMineMap` of the `elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php` file, which by default doesn't treat phar files as potentially executable PHP code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Unrestricted file type execution:** The server executes `.phar` files as PHP if configured, without elFinder explicitly blocking this MIME type.
2.  **Inadequate MIME type validation:** elFinder's MIME type validation mechanism did not recognize `.phar` files as a potentially executable type by default.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload a specially crafted `.phar` file containing malicious PHP code. When the server processes the file, the code is executed, leading to complete compromise of the server.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The attacker can gain full control of the server and its data. This includes reading sensitive data, modifying files, and potentially disrupting services.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **File Upload:** An attacker uploads a malicious `.phar` file through the elFinder interface.
2.  **File Access:** If the server is configured to execute `.phar` files, accessing the uploaded `.phar` file (e.g. via a direct URL) triggers the execution of the embedded PHP code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting elFinder.
2.  **elFinder Access:** The attacker requires access to the elFinder file manager, which may or may not require prior authentication.
3.  **Server Misconfiguration (Specific to .phar Execution):** The server must be misconfigured to execute `.phar` files as PHP for the exploit to work (as noted by the Snyk description). If .phar files are not executed by the PHP interpreter then this exploit will not work.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in `studio-42/elfinder` versions prior to 2.1.58.
*   The fix involves adding the mapping `'phar:*' => 'text/x-php'` to the `staticMineMap` in `php/elFinderVolumeDriver.class.php`, which prevents `.phar` files from being treated as an allowed type, thereby preventing the execution of the malicious code inside them.
*   The attacker can use short tags such as `<?=` as a bypass to the restriction of php string.

**CVSS Score:**

* Snyk: 8.1 High
* NVD: 9.8 Critical

This vulnerability is considered high risk because it allows for unauthenticated RCE if the server is improperly configured to parse .phar files as PHP, which is a common configuration. The fix is to update elFinder to version 2.1.58 or later, which adds `.phar` files to the list of disallowed file types.
