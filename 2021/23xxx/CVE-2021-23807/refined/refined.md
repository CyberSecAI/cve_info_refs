Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23807:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a Prototype Pollution issue in the `jsonpointer` library. It stems from a type confusion vulnerability that bypasses a previous fix for Prototype Pollution. The `set` function of the library does not properly validate the path components when they are arrays, allowing attackers to inject properties into the `Object.prototype`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Type Confusion:** The vulnerability exists because the code does not strictly enforce path components to be strings or numbers when accessing object properties. It was possible to bypass the existing checks by providing an array as a path component.
*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core weakness is the ability to modify the `Object.prototype` by manipulating special attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype`. This is due to the way the `set` function handles input paths, specifically when they are arrays containing these potentially dangerous property names.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the `Object.prototype` with unexpected values, attackers can cause JavaScript exceptions leading to a denial of service. For example, polluting the `toString` method could break any code relying on it.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In specific scenarios where the code evaluates a polluted property (e.g., using `eval(someobject.someattr)`), an attacker could achieve remote code execution.
*   **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject properties into the `Object.prototype` that the application relies on, potentially altering security properties like cookies or tokens (e.g., injecting `isAdmin: true`).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker can manipulate the path parameter of the `jsonpointer.set` function.
*   By providing an array as a path component, the attacker can bypass previous checks designed to prevent prototype pollution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the input passed to the `jsonpointer.set` function. Specifically, the attacker must be able to craft the path parameter.
*   No specific privileges are required, and the vulnerability can potentially be exploited remotely.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability was demonstrated with the following proof-of-concept:

```javascript
const jsonpointer = require('jsonpointer');

jsonpointer.set({}, [['proto'], ['proto'], 'polluted'], 'yes');
console.log(polluted); // yes
```

This shows how using arrays for path components allows the attacker to bypass the original fix.

**Additional Information:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability involves adding a check within the `compilePointer` function to ensure that each path component is either a string or a number. If not, an error is thrown.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.0.0 of the `jsonpointer` package.
*   The vulnerability is identified as CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype.

**CVSS Scores:**

*   Snyk: 5.6 (Medium)
*   NVD: 9.8 (Critical)
*   Red Hat: 7.3 (High)

The different scores reflect different interpretations of the potential impact.

**Mitigation:**

The recommended fix is to upgrade to `jsonpointer` version 5.0.0 or higher. Additional preventative measures include:

1.  Freezing the prototype using `Object.freeze(Object.prototype)`.
2.  Validating JSON input using schemas.
3.  Avoiding unsafe recursive merge functions.
4.  Using objects without prototypes, e.g. `Object.create(null)`.
5.  Using `Map` instead of `Object`.
