## How to fix?

Upgrade `org.webjars.npm:jsonpointer` to version 5.0.0 or higher.

## Overview

[org.webjars.npm:jsonpointer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonpointer) is a Simple JSON Addressing.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. A type confusion vulnerability can lead to a bypass of a previous Prototype Pollution fix when the pointer components are arrays.

### PoC

```
const jsonpointer = require('jsonpointer');

// jsonpointer.set({}, ['proto', 'proto', 'polluted'], 'yes');
// console.log(polluted); // ReferenceError: polluted is not defined

jsonpointer.set({}, [['proto'], ['proto'], 'polluted'], 'yes');
console.log(polluted); // yes

```
## Details

Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values. Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.

There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:

* Unsafe `Object` recursive merge
* Property definition by path

### Unsafe Object recursive merge

The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:

```
merge (target, source)

foreach property of source

```
if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source

  merge(target[property], source[property])

else

  target[property] = source[property]

```

```

When the source object contains a property named `__proto__` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the `Object` prototype.

Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: `merge({},source)`.

`lodash` and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.

### Property definition by path

There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object, path, value)`

If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to `__proto__.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.

## Types of attacks

There are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:

| Type | Origin | Short description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Denial of service (DoS)** | Client | This is the most likely attack. DoS occurs when `Object` holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, `toString` and `valueOf`).  The attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` and alters its state to an unexpected value such as `Int` or `Object`. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service. **For example:** if an attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.toString` by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on `someobject.toString()` it would fail. |
| **Remote Code Execution** | Client | Remote code execution is generally only possible in cases where the codebase evaluates a specific attribute of an object, and then executes that evaluation.**For example:** `eval(someobject.someattr)`. In this case, if the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` they are likely to be able to leverage this in order to execute code. |
| **Property Injection** | Client | The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens. **For example:** if a codebase checks privileges for `someuser.isAdmin`, then when the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.isAdmin` and sets it to equal `true`, they can then achieve admin privileges. |

## Affected environments

The following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:

* Application server
* Web server
* Web browser
## How to prevent

1. Freeze the prototype— use `Object.freeze (Object.prototype)`.
2. Require schema validation of JSON input.
3. Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.
4. Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, `Object.create(null)`), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.
5. As a best practice use `Map` instead of `Object`.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.6 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

### @dellalibera **[dellalibera](/dellalibera)** commented [Sep 27, 2021](#issue-1008355652)

Hi [@janl](https://github.com/janl),

Here is the PR for fixing the Prototype Pollution vulnerability we discussed by email.

The existing fix can by bypassed, for example, with the following payloads:

* adding a property before a dangerous path. This is because only `pointer[1] === '__proto__'` is checked

```
jsonpointer.set({}, '/foo/__proto__/boo', 'polluted')
```

* by a type confusion attack, where the path components are array:

```
jsonpointer.set({}, [['__proto__'], ['__proto__'], 'boo'], 'polluted')
```

This is because the `===` operator returns always `false` when the operands are of different type.

This PR tries to address the above cases and adds more unit-tests.

Any feedback is more than welcome.

Sorry, something went wrong.

That function mutates the array and it's not related to the fixes.

What's the intention of it? Object access works with strings and numbers, so it's not really necessary.

Hi [@marcbachmann](https://github.com/marcbachmann) ,

thanks for your comment. When using the bracket notation, it is possible to provide values of different types (for example objects - i.e arrays) as key property to access objects. In this case, they are first coerced to their string representation and then used as a key to access the object (<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_accessors#property_names>). For example this is a valid code:

```
let obj = {}
let key = ["admin"]
obj[key] = 1
console.log(obj["admin"]) // 1
```

This function makes sure that path components are only strings or numbers and not array.

Without this function, the following path would still led to a Prototype Pollution (type confusion):

```
jsonpointer.set({}, [["__proto__"], ["__proto__"], "polluted"], "yes")
```

The `===` operator is used to check if the parts are equals to `__proto__`, `constructor` or `prototype`. However, this operator returns `false` if the operands have different type (for example `["__proto__"] === "__proto__"` returns `false`).

Please, let me know if something is not clear.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Thanks for the description.

What do you think about just returning an an "invalid" pointer instead of mutating the array?

Or maybe even throwing an error would be more transparent.

```
for (const part of pointer) {
   if (typeof part !== 'string' && typeof part !== 'number') {
     return ['__proto__']
   }
}
```

Hey [@marcbachmann](https://github.com/marcbachmann) :)

thanks for the suggestions :)

In my opinion, returning a "invalid" pointer could potentially lead to unexpected behavior.

On the other side, throwing an error, I think could be instead a valid option, but I'm not sure if this will break existing code.

About the proposed fix, technically, even arrays or objects could be used as keys to access object properties (see example above).

The main point of this function is to make sure that, when the components of the path are later

compared with those potentially dangerous string values (`"__proto__"`, `"constructor"`, `"prototype"`), they are either strings or numbers, making not possible to bypass this checks with unexpected types.

I see both options as valid and transparent to prevent this issue, but I'll let you choose which one is more feasible in this context (I don't have any objection).

Please, let me know if something is not clear.

Sorry, something went wrong.

I think I come down in favour of only accepting strings and numbers as input. If folks need to rely on implicit casting of `["key"]` to `"key"` they need to do that outside of jsonpointer. I’m not worried about breaking code, as long as we make this a new major version.

Hey [@janl](https://github.com/janl) :)

Thanks a lot of your reply. I applied the changes. Now it throws an error if the path components are not strings or numbers. Let me know if now it's ok or if I have to change something.
