Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-23953:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the PDF viewer in Firefox (pdf.js). It fails to properly handle redirects when fetching parts of a PDF file using range requests. Specifically, when a PDF is loaded in chunks, and a request for a chunk is redirected to a different origin, the PDF viewer incorrectly loads the data from the redirected URL without proper origin checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Origin Information Leakage:** The core issue is the ability to bypass cross-origin restrictions. The PDF viewer loads data from a different origin than the original PDF file due to the redirect, thus leaking potentially sensitive cross-origin data.
*   **Inadequate Redirect Handling:** The vulnerability stems from not properly handling redirects when requesting chunks of the PDF data. Specifically, the PDF viewer was not checking the origin of the response after a redirect.
*   **Vulnerability with HTTP 206 Range Requests:** The vulnerability is specifically triggered when the server responds to range requests using HTTP 206.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** An attacker can craft a malicious PDF file that, when loaded, will redirect requests for its chunks to a different, potentially sensitive, origin. This can lead to the exfiltration of private data from the victim's website.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Data Reads:** By redirecting the PDF chunk requests, the attacker can make the PDF viewer fetch data from any website, thus enabling arbitrary reads of website data if the attacker gains code execution within the PDF viewer.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF File:** An attacker must create a specially crafted PDF file. This PDF file contains a link which, when clicked by the victim, triggers the vulnerable code. The PDF file would be structured so that certain parts of the file would trigger a network request and a redirect to a cross-origin.
*   **User Interaction:**  The user must interact with the malicious PDF file by clicking in the PDF which triggers the network request with the redirect.
*   **Network Request Redirection:** When a user clicks a link within a crafted PDF, this triggers the PDF viewer to make requests for additional chunks of data for the PDF file.  The attacker controls the server response of this initial request, and sets up the response to redirect the range requests to the attacker's desired target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to serve a malicious PDF file:** The attacker needs to host or deliver a crafted PDF file.
*   **Knowledge of Range Request Vulnerability:** The attacker must understand the PDF.js chunk loading mechanism and how it uses range requests to retrieve data.
*   **Server that supports range requests with HTTP 206:** The attacker must have the ability to set up redirects on their server to handle range requests to the target site, with the target site responding to range requests with HTTP 206.
*   **Social Engineering/Phishing:** The attacker must trick the user into opening the PDF and clicking inside it.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided bugzilla content provides a detailed description of the technical details of the bug and the fix, as well as the patch.
*   The fix involved setting `xhr.channel.QueryInterface(Ci.nsIHttpChannel).redirectionLimit = 0;` for range requests. This prevents the PDF viewer from automatically following redirects for range requests.
