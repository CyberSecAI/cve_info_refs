  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the use of `innerHTML` in JavaScript code within error page templates of Firefox for Android (Fenix). These templates, located within the `resource://` scheme, are vulnerable to reflected XSS because they directly incorporate user-controlled parameters into HTML content.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to the usage of `innerHTML` to inject user-supplied data into HTML templates, without proper sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the `resource://` origin. This can lead to several impacts:\n\n1.  **Address bar spoofing**: By manipulating the content of error pages, an attacker can display a fake address bar, potentially tricking users into believing they are on a legitimate website.\n2.  **Fake error pages**: Attackers can display custom error pages to mislead users.\n3.  **Cross-origin access**: JavaScript code running on a `resource:` origin can interact with error pages shown in other windows, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user.",
  "Attack vectors": "The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious `resource://` URL with injected JavaScript code in the query parameters (e.g., `title`, `description`). This URL can be shared via an intent from other applications (e.g., SMS, SNS), which, upon being opened by Firefox for Android, will trigger the XSS vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to create and share malicious `resource://` URLs via other applications. The user needs to be using Firefox for Android and click the link, thus triggering the vulnerability."
