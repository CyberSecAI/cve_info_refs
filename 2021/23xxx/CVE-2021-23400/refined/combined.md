| Please fill the following questionnaire about your issue:   1. What kind of issue are you reporting?  * A bug in Nodemailer * A bug in a plugin of Nodemailer (eg. issues with nodemailer-sendgrid) * Feature request * Looking for help to resolve some kind of problem with Nodemailer  2. Are you listed as a sponsor of Nodemailer project (see Sponsors button above)?  * Yes. Sponsors get priority support * No. Unless it is a bug in Nodemailer you might find support from public forums like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=nodemailer).  3. State your problem here:   I've got a pretty standard `sendMail` call here in an HTTP handler:  ``` await transporter.sendMail({   from: '...',   to: '...',   replyTo: {     name,     address,   },   subject: 'My Subject',   text: message, }); ```  An `address` that contains line-breaks can add arbitrary SMTP headers. In my mind, the reason for using an address object is to avoid having to deal with escaping odd names and addresses (like would be necessary with ``${name} <${address}>``); therefore, it is expected that `name` and `address` don't have to be sanitized. Otherwise, it's not just an address object, but an "address plus maybe arbitrary headers," which is not something anyone would *want* to have. I'm not sure what other fields are vulnerable. This was discovered by [@lol768](https://github.com/lol768). |

## How to fix?

Upgrade `org.webjars.npm:nodemailer` to version 6.6.1 or higher.

## Overview

[org.webjars.npm:nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.org/package/nodemailer) is an Easy as cake e-mail sending from your Node.js applications

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP Header Injection if unsanitized user input that may contain newlines and carriage returns is passed into an address object.

### PoC:

```
const userEmail = 'foo@bar.comrnSubject: foobar'; // imagine this comes from e.g. HTTP request params or is otherwise user-controllable
await transporter.sendMail({
from: '...',
to: '...',
replyTo: {
name: 'Customer',
address: userEmail,
},
subject: 'My Subject',
text: message,
});

```

### CVSS Scores

### Snyk

6.3¬†medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed ‚Äúremotely exploitable‚Äù and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. For example, a successful exploit may only be possible during the installation of an application by a system administrator.

  **Required**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.
