Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23406:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the unsafe handling of PAC (Proxy Auto-Config) files within the `pac-resolver` library. Specifically, the library uses `vm2` to execute javascript code from the PAC file, however, the `vm2` sandbox is not secure enough and allows for code to escape.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code by crafting malicious PAC files.
- **Inadequate Sandboxing:** The use of `vm2` for isolating the execution of PAC code proved insufficient, leading to sandbox escape.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** An attacker can gain full control over the vulnerable process.
    - They can potentially read environment variables, exfiltrate data, modify files, and disrupt the system by killing the process or performing other actions.
- The impact is considered severe due to the potential for complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, making it remotely accessible.
- **PAC File Manipulation:** The attacker needs to deliver or inject a malicious PAC file to be processed by the vulnerable application.
- This could be achieved via a man-in-the-middle attack on the network, a vulnerable proxy configuration, or any other vulnerability that allows setting the proxy configuration of the victim machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to intercept or manipulate network traffic to supply a malicious PAC file, be on the local network, or be able to set configuration values.
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker doesn't need any prior access to the system or special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability is exploitable without any user action on the target system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in the `node-degenerator` library, which is a dependency of `pac-resolver`.
- The fix involves enhancing the sandboxing mechanism to prevent code execution outside the restricted environment.
- The vulnerability is present in `pac-resolver` versions before 5.0.0 and 6.0.2.
- The provided PoC demonstrates how an attacker can execute arbitrary code, read environment variables, and kill the process.

**Summary of the fix:**
The fix involves two commits in the `node-degenerator` library:
- `ccc3445`: Fixes a bug related to returning `undefined` values.
- `9d25bb6`: Addresses the core sandbox escape by setting the filename option and not exposing the process object.
