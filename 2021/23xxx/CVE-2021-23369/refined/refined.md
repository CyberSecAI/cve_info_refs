## Analysis of CVE-2021-23369

Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**1. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way the `handlebars` template engine processes certain compilation options, specifically when compiling templates from untrusted sources in strict mode.
*   The vulnerability allows access to the `__proto__` object, which can be manipulated to achieve code execution.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The core vulnerability is that it allows for remote code execution.
*   **Insecure Template Compilation:** The handlebars library fails to adequately sanitize or restrict access to potentially dangerous properties when compiling templates in strict mode from untrusted sources.
*   **Prototype Pollution:** The proof of concept leverages access to `__proto__` which can lead to prototype pollution, allowing the attacker to modify object prototypes and potentially influence the behavior of the application.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server or client-side when the template engine is used. This can lead to a wide range of attacks.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) Triad Impact:**
    *   **Confidentiality:** Sensitive information could be disclosed.
    *  **Integrity:** Data could be modified.
    *   **Availability:** The system could become unavailable due to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
*   The snyk.io information indicates a CVSS score of 7 (High) and NVD with 9.8 (Critical).

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the compilation of a malicious handlebars template. The template includes code to access the object prototype using the \_\_lookupGetter\_\_ method and manipulates the prototype to inject malicious javascript.
*   The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack, making it remotely exploitable over the internet.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Needed:** No prior authorization or user interaction is required.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system.
*   **Ability to Submit Malicious Template:** The attacker must be able to introduce or influence the compilation of the malicious template in the vulnerable component. This is typically achieved by injecting malicious template code through a web request or input field that isn't sanitized.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the vulnerability. It exploits the `__lookupGetter__`, `constructor`, `getOwnPropertyDescriptor`, `defineProperty`, `split`, `push`, `concat`, `slice`, `apply`, and `each` Handlebars methods to inject arbitrary code.
*   The vulnerability occurs when `strict` compilation mode is enabled in `handlebars` version prior to 4.7.7.
* The vulnerability is addressed with commits [f058970](https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/commit/f0589701698268578199be25285b2ebea1c1e427) and [b6d3de7](https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/commit/b6d3de7123eebba603e321f04afdbae608e8fea8)

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed by upgrading to `handlebars` version 4.7.7 or higher.

**NetApp Products:**

*   NetApp has stated that **no** NetApp products are affected by this vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2021-23369 is a critical RCE vulnerability in Handlebars versions prior to 4.7.7, which can be exploited by crafting a malicious template, particularly when the template is compiled in strict mode. This can have serious implications for the CIA triad. The vulnerability is mitigated by upgrading to version 4.7.7 or higher. NetApp has indicated that none of their products are affected by this vulnerability.
