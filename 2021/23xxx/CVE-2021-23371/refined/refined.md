Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23371:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unbounded regular expression used in the `chrono-node` library for parsing time units. Specifically, the regular expression used to match time units (like days, hours, minutes, seconds) and the spaces between them was vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS):** The core issue is that the regex pattern, when faced with a string containing many time units separated by an excessive number of spaces, can cause the regex engine to enter into a very long backtracking process, consuming excessive CPU and potentially causing a denial of service. The vulnerable regex pattern is located in `src/locales/*/constants.ts` files which are used to parse localized date/time strings. The vulnerable pattern is `(?:(?:about|around)\\s\*)?${SINGLE\_TIME\_UNIT\_PATTERN\_NO\_CAPTURE}\\s\*(?:,?\\s\*${SINGLE\_TIME\_UNIT\_PATTERN\_NO\_CAPTURE})\*`
- The fix replaces the unbounded regex with a helper function `repeatedTimeunitPattern` in `src/utils/pattern.ts` which uses the regex: `${prefix}${singleTimeunitPatternNoCapture}\\s\*(?:,?\\s{0,5}${singleTimeunitPatternNoCapture}){0,10}`. This limits the number of repetitions of time units and whitespace.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can provide specially crafted input strings to the vulnerable function, causing excessive CPU consumption and making the service unresponsive or unavailable.
- **Catastrophic backtracking**: As explained in the snyk.io content, the regex engine will try multiple combinations to find matches, and with an excessive number of spaces it will cause a large number of steps which will take a lot of time.

**Attack vectors:**
-  An attacker could supply a long string with multiple time units separated by an excessive number of spaces to the `chrono.parse()` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the input that is parsed using the vulnerable `chrono-node` library. This could be achieved via a web application that processes user-provided dates or any other system that uses the library to parse date/time strings from external sources.
- No special privileges or user interaction are required.

**Additional Information:**
- The fix implemented in commit `98815b57622443b5c498a427210ebd603d705f4c`  addressed this vulnerability by limiting the amount of whitespace allowed.
- The vulnerability was initially reported by jonpincus as issue #382.
- The vulnerable code was present in versions of `chrono-node` prior to 2.2.4.
