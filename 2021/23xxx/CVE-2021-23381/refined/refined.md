- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `killing` package uses the `child_process.exec` function without sanitizing user-provided input, leading to command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary command injection due to lack of input sanitization when using `child_process.exec`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system by providing malicious input to the `killing` function. This can lead to a variety of impacts, including data modification, information disclosure, and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through user input that is passed to the `killing` function. Specifically, by injecting shell commands into the input, an attacker can execute them on the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to control the input passed to the `killing` function. No prior authentication or special privileges are required.
