## How to fix?

Upgrade `@braintree/sanitize-url` to version 6.0.0 or higher.

## Overview

[@braintree/sanitize-url](https://www.npmjs.org/package/%40braintree/sanitize-url) is an A url sanitizer

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) due to improper sanitization in `sanitizeUrl` function.

## PoC:

```
const sanitizeUrl = require("@braintree/sanitize-url").sanitizeUrl

for(const vector of [ "&#0000106&#0000097&#0000118&#0000097&#0000115&#0000099&#0000114&#0000105&#0000112&#0000116&#0000058&#0000097&#0000108&#0000101&#0000114&#0000116&#0000040&#0000039&#0000088&#0000083&#0000083&#0000039&#0000041",

"jav ascript:alert('XSS');",
" &#14; javascript:alert('XSS');"
]) {
console.log(sanitizeUrl(vector))
}

```
## Details

A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.

This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML) in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.

Injecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.

Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.

The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.

### Types of attacks

There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:

| Type | Origin | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Stored** | Server | The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link. |
| **Reflected** | Server | The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser. |
| **DOM-based** | Client | The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data. |
| **Mutated** |  | The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters. |

### Affected environments

The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:

* Web servers
* Application servers
* Web application environments

### How to prevent

This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code:

* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches.
* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.
* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.
* Redirect invalid requests.
* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.
* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.
* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.4 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. For example, a successful exploit may only be possible during the installation of an application by a system administrator.

  **Required**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

### @crookedneighbor **[crookedneighbor](/crookedneighbor)** commented [Feb 22, 2022](#issue-1147106096)

[Jira](https://engineering.paypalcorp.com/jira/browse/DTBTSDK-1485)

Addresses a reported XSS vulnerability in this package.

If the urls provided are HTML encoded, they'll remain HTML encoded when dynamically created using the DOM api. However, if rendered as HTML from the server, they'll get converted to readable entities without sanitization.

This update decodes the HTML in the url before sanitizing.

It's technically a breaking change, since it's transforming the URL, so it'll go out as v6.

Sorry, something went wrong.

They are HTML encoded characters. So each character can be rendered as itself or as an HTML entity. For instance, `j` can be `&#106;` or `&#x6A;` or `&#0000106` (see [https://www.htmlsymbols.xyz/unicode/U+006A](https://www.htmlsymbols.xyz/unicode/U%2B006A))

I wish I had an easy go-to site for generating them, but since `j` is a valid encoded character, by default, encoders don't convert it. Had trouble finding a place that would encode it using the special characters.

Most of these values came from the XSS report, and they do decode to the expected values.

Sorry, something went wrong.
