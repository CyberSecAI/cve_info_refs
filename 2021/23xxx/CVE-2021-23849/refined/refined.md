- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web-based interface of Bosch IP cameras does not properly validate requests, allowing a CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability (CWE-352).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions on the affected system. The impact can include unauthorized changes to the camera's configuration, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the device.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out via a malicious link or website that the victim is tricked into clicking while being logged into the camera's web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into interacting with a malicious link or website. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the camera itself, but the victim must be authenticated. The attacker has to be able to get the victim to click a link, or open a website that will make the forged request.
