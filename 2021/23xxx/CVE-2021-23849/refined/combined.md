### Secure Configuration Environment

It is advised to use a Bosch tool like the Configuration Manager to configure the camera, that is not vulnerable to issues like XSS (Cross Site Scripting) or CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery).

When using the web based configuration interface and currently being logged in as an administrator, some security precautions can be taken to mitigate XSS or CSRF vulnerabilities:

* No other websites or email content should be opened as long as the session to the camera is active.
* No links should be clicked from an untrusted external source that link back to the camera.
* Use a different browser than the system default browser to open a session to the camera as there is no XSS or CSRF between browsers.
* Always log out and/or close the browser (not only the tab) to clear any session data.

## Vulnerability Details

### CVE-2021-23849

CVE description: A vulnerability in the web-based interface allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger actions on an affected system on behalf of another user (CSRF - Cross Site Request Forgery).
