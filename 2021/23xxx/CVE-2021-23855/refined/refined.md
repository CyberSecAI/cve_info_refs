Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2021-23855:

**CVE-2021-23855**

*   **Root Cause:** The user and password database is exposed through an unprotected web server resource.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information (user database with hashed passwords) is accessible without authentication.
    *   **Weak Hashing Algorithm:** Passwords are hashed using a weak algorithm, making them susceptible to cracking via rainbow tables.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can obtain user credentials (passwords) by gaining access to the exposed data. This could lead to unauthorized access to the system and further compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network-based attack, accessing an unprotected web server resource.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable web server resource via network, but does not require any authentication, nor a high level of technical skill.

In summary, CVE-2021-23855 involves the exposure of user data via an unprotected web server resource, compounded by a weak hashing algorithm, allowing an attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access.
