The provided content relates to CVE-2021-23956.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
An ambiguous file picker design in Firefox could confuse users into uploading an entire directory when they intended to select a single file. This was due to the file picker dialog automatically focusing on the "OK" button when a directory was selected, and a user holding down the "Enter" key could unintentionally confirm the folder upload without explicit confirmation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of explicit user confirmation before uploading a directory.
- Automatic focus on the "OK" button in the file picker dialog.
- The potential for a user to unknowingly upload a complete directory by repeatedly pressing "Enter".

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The vulnerability allowed a malicious website to trick a user into disclosing the contents of a directory on their local machine. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious website could use an HTML input element with the `webkitdirectory` attribute to trigger the file picker dialog.
- By manipulating the user's interactions, the attacker could trick the user into selecting a directory and quickly uploading it.
- An attacker could also predict the position of the upload button and place a fake input field there to further trick the user into uploading files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious website that can be accessed by the victim using Firefox.
- The attacker needs to create an HTML input field to trigger the file picker dialog.
- The attacker must be able to induce user interaction or utilize the "enter" key repeating feature to trigger the upload of the folder.
