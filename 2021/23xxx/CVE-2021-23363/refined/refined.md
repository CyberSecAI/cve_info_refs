Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-23363

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of the `child_process.exec` function within the `killByPort` function of the `kill-by-port` package without proper sanitization of user-controlled input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Arbitrary Command Injection (CWE-77):** The `killByPort` function takes a port number as input. This input is then directly embedded into a shell command executed using `child_process.exec`. Because there is no sanitization, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands by providing malicious input.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system where the vulnerable code is running. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as:
*   Data breaches
*   System compromise
*   Denial of service

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the `killByPort` function, which takes the port number as user input.
*   The vulnerable component is network bound, making it potentially remotely exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to control the input passed to the `killByPort` function.
*   Low privileges are required for exploitation
*   No user interaction is needed

**Additional Information:**
* The fix was to parse the port to an int using `parseInt(port, 10)`
* A proof of concept was provided demonstrating arbitrary command execution using `kill_by_port.killByPort('$(touch success)');` where the shell command `touch success` will be executed.

**Summary:**
The `kill-by-port` package versions prior to 0.0.2 are vulnerable to arbitrary command injection due to the lack of input sanitization when using `child_process.exec`. An attacker can exploit this by providing malicious input to the `killByPort` function, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the system.
