Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Type confusion vulnerability in the `escapeHTML` function of the `bootstrap-table` library. The function does not correctly sanitize input when it is an array instead of a string, leading to a bypass of input sanitization even if the `escape` attribute is set.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) due to the lack of proper input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious code (e.g., JavaScript) into the application, which will be executed in the user's browser.
- This can lead to:
    - Stealing cookies and hijacking user sessions.
    - Exposing sensitive information.
    - Gaining access to privileged services and functionality.
    - Delivering malware.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker provides malicious input, specifically an array, where a string is expected. This input bypasses the intended sanitization within the `escapeHTML` function when rendering data in the `bootstrap-table`.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the application displays data received from a JSON endpoint that is rendered using the library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the data being fed to the `bootstrap-table`, either directly by modifying the JSON response, or indirectly by influencing the data that gets passed to the component from the server.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to the vulnerable system.
- User interaction is required: a user needs to load the affected page to trigger the execution of malicious code.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects `bootstrap-table` versions prior to 1.19.1.
- The fix is to upgrade to version 1.19.1 or higher.
- The vulnerability is present in multiple packages that wrap the `bootstrap-table` library including `org.webjars.bower:bootstrap-table`, `org.webjars.npm:bootstrap-table`, `org.webjars.bowergithub.wenzhixin:bootstrap-table`, and `org.webjars:bootstrap-table`.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.
- The attack complexity is high, as it requires the attacker to craft specific input to bypass the sanitization.
- The impact on confidentiality is low, while there is no impact on integrity and availability.
