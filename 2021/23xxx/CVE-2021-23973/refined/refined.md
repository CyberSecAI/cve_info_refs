Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-23973:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- When attempting to load a cross-origin media resource (audio/video), a decoding error could occur. The error message generated by the decoding process could reveal information about the resource's content. Specifically, the MediaError message property exposed details of the decoding error, which could vary based on the nature of the resource, allowing an attacker to infer characteristics about it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Information Leakage**: The primary vulnerability was the leakage of information through the MediaError message property. This message, intended for debugging purposes, was not properly sanitized when dealing with cross-origin resources.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Low Impact**: The vulnerability has a low impact rating.
- **Information Disclosure**: An attacker could potentially infer details about the existence or characteristics of cross-origin media resources, which might not otherwise be exposed due to CORS policies. This could potentially help an attacker craft further attacks or gain knowledge of internal resources.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Cross-origin media loading:** The attack requires the victim's browser to load a cross-origin media resource. The attacker would need to control the resource being loaded in order to cause a specific error and gain information from the error message.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to serve cross-origin media:** The attacker needs to be able to host a media resource on a different origin than the page containing the vulnerable code.
- **Ability to cause decoding errors**: The attacker needs to craft a media resource that will cause a decoding error in the victim's browser.
- **Access to browser functionality**: The attacker needs to be able to trigger the loading of the malicious resource via the browser.

**Additional Details:**

- The bug report mentions that this vulnerability is similar to a previously fixed issue (CVE-2020-15666), where the `MediaError` message property leaked cross-origin response status information. However, this new issue was related to errors during decoding rather than initial loading.
- The fix involves modifying the code to ensure error details are not revealed for cross-origin decoding errors and replacing the detailed message with a default error string.
- The vulnerability affects both Firefox and Thunderbird.
