{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The HiQnet protocol implementation in the head unit's AudioManager service has a vulnerability where the Message Length field in the header of a HiQnet message is not checked for validity. This can lead to an out-of-bounds memory access when processing subsequent messages.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of input validation: The Message Length field in the HiQnet header is not checked for validity, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.",
     "Use of unchecked value as offset"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause an out-of-bounds memory read, potentially leading to a crash or other unexpected behavior in the AudioManager service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attack: An attacker can send specially crafted HiQnet messages over the network to trigger the vulnerability."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the head unit's network, typically achieved by connecting to the head unit's internal network, such as by pretending to be the CSB or T-Box.",
     "additional_information": "This vulnerability is in the locating stage of HiQnet message processing, specifically within the function ComPort::processTcpMessage."
