Package        : openexr
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-3598 CVE-2021-3605 CVE-2021-3933 CVE-2021-3941
                 CVE-2021-23215 CVE-2021-26260 CVE-2021-45942
Debian Bug     : 992703 990450 990899 1014828 1014828

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been found in OpenEXR, command-line
tools and a library for the OpenEXR image format. Buffer overflows or
out-of-bound reads could lead to a denial of service (application crash) if a
malformed image file is processed.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5.4-2+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openexr packages.

For the detailed security status of openexr please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openexr>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Debian Bug     : 986796 992703 990450 990899 1014828

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been found in OpenEXR, command-line
tools and a library for the OpenEXR image format. Buffer overflows or
out-of-bound reads could lead to a denial of service (application crash) if
a malformed image file is processed.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.2.1-4.1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your openexr packages.

For the detailed security status of openexr please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openexr>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

| size\_t is one of those scary types due to the way it's defined as being "at least 65535"... Thankfully SIZE\_MAX on MSVC/64 is 2 \*\* 64, which is the platform where I would have expected a silly pitfall. I suggest adding a compile time assert that size\_t is at least 64 bits on 64 bit platforms to ensure we don't have problems with files over 2\*\*32 bytes in size. I'm sure that's the first thing a fuzzer is going to try :) |

| [@lgritz](https://github.com/lgritz) That's what I expect as well, and observe with the three compilers I use. This caveat in the spec always makes me worry. It seems like a poison pill to let one compiler do something bonkers:   * size\_t is commonly used for array indexing and loop counting. Programs that use other types, such as unsigned int, for array indexing may fail on, e.g. 64-bit systems when the index exceeds UINT\_MAX or if it relies on 32-bit modular arithmetic.   This caveat bugs me so much, I use the sized types, like uint32\_t everywhere in my code now except for when I'm dealing with std routines that explicitly return a size\_t.  Note also the caveat of "anything with a size() method"... The code in question here is  ``` size_t rleAmount = 2 * pixelCount * OPENEXR_IMF_NAMESPACE::pixelTypeSize (_channelData[chan].type); ```  I think that the type we want is ptrdiff\_t, because that's the type that's guaranteed by spec to represent the biggest addressable memory size |

I think ptrdiff\_t is the more appropriate type here, per the conversation with [@lgritz](https://github.com/lgritz) in the main thread.

| When I read that quote, what it appears to say is that size\_t is safe for array indexing, but that *other* types, like regular `unsigned int` or `uint32_t` may not be, because they aren't guaranteed to be big enough to index into all possible arrays.  ptrdiff\_t is the signed equivalent to size\_t -- it's the thing that you know is guaranteed to safely hold the difference between any two addresses on that architecture. |

| Well, size\_t "can store the maximum size of a theoretically possible object of any type (including array)" and is the type passed to `new`, which is what it's used for here.  I switched those variables to size\_t because they are ultimately copied to member variables which are of type size\_t:   [openexr/src/lib/OpenEXR/ImfDwaCompressor.h](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/blob/dd87e540bc6d89eb0e2c4ae6e3157626f5ed1958/src/lib/OpenEXR/ImfDwaCompressor.h#L173)  Line 173 in [dd87e54](/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/commit/dd87e540bc6d89eb0e2c4ae6e3157626f5ed1958)   |  | size\_t \_packedAcBufferSize; | | --- | --- |      It appears those values ultimately get written into the files as Int64, so maybe changing these types to Int64, including in the header, would be safest? That would change the memory layout of the DwaCompressor object on some architectures, which I was trying to avoid.  In the reported fuzz issue, there's a file which caused a signed int overflow in the buffer size calculation. Maybe the answer is to use Int64 for the calculation, then test the value is less than limits<size\_t>::max before casting to size\_t in the `new`? |

* Fix Apple Universal 2 (arm64/x86_64) builds

* In these types of builds we want arm64 and x86_64 (with AVX optimisations).
  However the way cmake works (with `CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=\"arm64;x86_64\"`
  means that we share one OpenEXRConfigInternal.h between both builds. So
  we have to have OPENEXR_IMF_HAVE_GCC_INLINE_ASM_AVX mean \"AVX GCC asm is
  available if platform is x86\", rather than \"AVX GCC asm is available\".
  Then we decide on AVX optimisations based on that #define and also the
  platform defines.

Debian Bug     : 986796 990450

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenEXR, a library and
tools for the OpenEXR high dynamic-range (HDR) image format. An
attacker could cause a denial of service (DoS) through application
crash and excessive memory consumption.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.2.0-11+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your openexr packages.

For the detailed security status of openexr please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openexr>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
