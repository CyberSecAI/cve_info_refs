The provided content relates to CVE-2021-23979.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is memory safety bugs present in Firefox 85. Specifically, the identified bugs are related to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The content mentions "memory safety bugs" and "memory corruption", indicating use-after-free, out-of-bounds access or similar issues are present. The provided bug list includes the following:
*   use-after-poison in [@ nsBlockFrame::ReflowBlockFrame]
*   load of value which is not a valid value for type 'VideoInfo::Rotation'
*   Access of TransportSecurityInfo fields should hold mutex
*  Intermittent application crash in [@ nsAutoOwningEventTarget::AssertCurrentThreadOwnsMe(char const*) const]
*   pointer index expression overflowed
*  heap-use-after-free in [@ gfxFontCache::HashEntry::KeyEquals]
*  Assert that the register field of LUse can represent every register
* Cranelift API: max_memory_length returns bytes but should return pages
* Startup Crash in [@ mozilla::dom::serviceWorkerScriptCache::`anonymous namespace'::CompareNetwork::OnStreamComplete]
* Crash in [@ mozilla::ipc::IProtocol::ActorDealloc]
* Intermittent ThreadSanitizer: data race /builds/worker/checkouts/gecko/js/src/gc/Marking.cpp:1185:14 in mark<js::jit::JitCode>

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact is considered high. The description states that "some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code." This implies a potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors are not explicitly defined in the provided text. However, the vulnerabilities are triggered by activities within the browser, implying that malicious content loaded or processed by the browser could trigger them.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to trigger the specific memory corruption issues. This could involve crafting malicious web pages or other types of content that would be processed by the vulnerable Firefox browser. The attacker's position would be that of a remote attacker, given the vulnerabilities are triggered through the processing of potentially malicious content.
