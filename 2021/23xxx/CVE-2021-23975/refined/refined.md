Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23975:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect usage of memory profiling code within the `about:memory` developer tool in Firefox. Specifically, the code directly called the `sizeof` function on a pointer without first validating if the pointer was valid.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect pointer handling: The code attempted to use `malloc_usable_size()` on a pointer that was not allocated through malloc, leading to an invalid memory access.
- Lack of proper validation: The `sizeof` function was called directly without checking the pointer's validity, resulting in a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: The primary impact of this vulnerability is a crash in Firefox when the `about:memory` "Measure" function is invoked.

**Attack Vectors:**
- User interaction: The vulnerability is triggered by a user navigating to `about:memory` and clicking the "Measure" button.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to access and interact with Firefox's user interface. No special privileges or remote access are needed, as it can be triggered by a user within their own browser session.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involved using the correct API that checks for invalid pointers before calling `sizeof`, thus preventing the crash.
- The vulnerability was classified as low severity and was fixed in Firefox 86 and later versions, and was not present in the ESR 78.x branch.
- The vulnerability was also fixed in Firefox Beta 86.
- This issue is not exploitable to execute code, but just leads to a crash of the browser.
