Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23654:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in the `html-to-csv` package. Specifically, when the package encounters a formula embedded within an HTML page, it accepts it without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The core issue is the failure to validate or sanitize input received from an HTML page before converting it to CSV format. This allows malicious content to be included in the resulting CSV file.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Command Execution:** A malicious actor can embed or generate malicious links or potentially execute commands via the resulting CSV file. This could be through CSV injection attacks, where specially crafted formulas are interpreted as commands by spreadsheet software.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**: The CVSS scores indicate a potential for low impact on these areas, though they are still compromised. This could manifest as unauthorized access to restricted data, modification of data without control, and reduction in service availability.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network. An attacker could provide a crafted HTML page containing malicious formulas to be processed by `html-to-csv`.
*   **No User Interaction:**  The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any user interaction.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **None:** The attacker does not need any prior access or privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious input to the vulnerable component. This implies that the attacker needs to have a means to deliver a malicious html to a system using the vulnerable `html-to-csv` package.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the `html-to-csv` package up to the time of the report.
*   There is no fixed version available at the time of the report.
* The vulnerability is described as a medium severity vulnerability according to Snyk, but has a critical severity according to NVD.

In summary, the `html-to-csv` package is vulnerable due to a lack of input validation when processing HTML content containing formulas. This allows attackers to inject malicious code into CSV files generated by the package, leading to potential command execution.
