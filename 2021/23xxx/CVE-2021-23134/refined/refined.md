  "CVE-2021-23134": {
    "Description": "kiyin (尹亮) of TenCent discovered several reference counting bugs in the NFC LLCP implementation which could lead to use-after-free. A local user could exploit these for denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation. Nadav Markus and Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered that the original fixes for these introduced a new bug that could result in use-after-free and double-free. This has also been fixed.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a use-after-free condition in the NFC LLCP implementation caused by incorrect reference counting of the 'local' object. The initial fix for a refcount leak introduced a new issue where the same 'local' object could be freed multiple times.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Double-free",
        "Incorrect Reference Counting"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to denial of service (crash or memory corruption), and possibly privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "A local user with the ability to create and close NFC sockets.",
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability is triggered by creating two NFC sockets that are associated with the same 'local' object. When the first socket is closed, the 'local' object's reference count is decremented and may reach 0, leading to the object being freed. Closing the second socket then attempts to decrement the reference count of a dangling pointer, resulting in a use-after-free. The issue exists in both llcp_sock_bind and llcp_sock_connect."
