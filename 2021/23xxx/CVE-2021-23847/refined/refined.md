- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authentication in a critical function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authentication (CWE-287). The vulnerability lies in the lack of authentication checks for certain requests to the camera.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can extract sensitive information or change settings of the affected Bosch IP camera. This can lead to a complete compromise of the device, potentially allowing the attacker to eavesdrop on video feeds, modify recording schedules, or even use the camera as a pivot point for further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, unauthenticated network requests to the vulnerable interface of the camera.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the camera and the ability to send crafted HTTP requests. No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
