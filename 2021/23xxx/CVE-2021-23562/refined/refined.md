Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23562:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient handling of file names during the upload process. Specifically, the plupload library does not properly encode or sanitize file names, allowing an attacker to inject JavaScript code within the file name itself.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The core weakness is the ability to upload files with malicious file names containing JavaScript code.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plupload library fails to properly sanitize or encode the file names before processing them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** By tricking a user into uploading a file with a malicious filename containing JavaScript, the attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution within the user's browser or the context where the file is processed.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** While the direct impact on availability is listed as none, the confidentiality and integrity of the system can be compromised through the execution of malicious code.  An attacker might gain access to sensitive information, modify data, or potentially cause further harm to the application/system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable through the network. Attackers can target any application that uses the vulnerable plupload library.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires a user to upload a file with a crafted malicious filename. The attacker would need to trick or convince the user to perform this action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior access to the system or application.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a user into uploading a specially crafted file.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send the malicious file to the target application over the network.

**Affected Packages and Versions:**

The following packages and versions are affected:
- `org.webjars.bowergithub.moxiecode:plupload` versions before 3.1.5
- `plupload` versions before 2.3.9
- `org.webjars:plupload` all versions
- `org.webjars.bower:plupload` versions before 3.1.5

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability is fixed in the following versions:
- `org.webjars.bowergithub.moxiecode:plupload` version 3.1.5 or higher
- `plupload` version 2.3.9 or higher
- There is no fix available for `org.webjars:plupload`.
- `org.webjars.bower:plupload` version 3.1.5 or higher

The fix involves proper encoding of the file name to prevent JavaScript injection, as shown in the provided commit diff:
```
return plupload.xmlEncode(file[$1] || '');
```
This change uses `plupload.xmlEncode` to sanitize the filename before processing.
