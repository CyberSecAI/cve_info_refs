#### Introduced: 9 Jan 2022

[CVE-2021-23567  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-23567) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-400  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `colors`.

## Overview

[colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/colors) is a color manipulation library.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) that was introduced through an infinite loop in the `americanFlag` module.

Unfortunately this appears to have been a purposeful attempt by a maintainer of `colors` to make the package unusable, other maintainers' controls over this package appear to have been revoked in an attempt to prevent them from fixing the issue.

## Vulnerable Code

```
for (let i = 666; i < Infinity; i++;) {

```
## Alternative Remediation Suggested

* Pin dependency to `1.4.0`
## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.

Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).
* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Aws%3A20171108)

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**

January 9, 2022

 0 mins read

On January 8, 2022, the open source maintainer of the wildly popular npm package [colors](https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/colors), published `colors@1.4.1` and `colors@1.4.44-liberty-2` in which they intentionally introduced an offending [commit that adds an infinite loop](https://github.com/Marak/colors.js/commit/074a0f8ed0c31c35d13d28632bd8a049ff136fb6) to the source code. The infinite loop is triggered and executed immediately upon initialization of the package’s source code, and would result in a Denial of Service (DoS) to any Node.js server using it.

TL;DR: **Snyk issued a** [**Denial of Service security vulnerability for colors@1.4.1**](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-COLORS-2331906), following [this vulnerable code](https://github.com/Marak/colors.js/commit/074a0f8ed0c31c35d13d28632bd8a049ff136fb6#diff-92bbac9a308cd5fcf9db165841f2d90ce981baddcb2b1e26cfff170929af3bd1R18). **We highly recommend you revert to** `colors@1.4.0`**, and pin your dependencies’ versions to avoid blind upgrades of the offending version. We also recommend you migrate to a different package.** Continue reading for more information on scope, impact, and recommended counter-measures.

## About `colors`

The `colors` open source npm package receives over 20 million downloads a week and is a key ecosystem project with JavaScript and Node.js developers, powering a great set of projects. GitHub records show that the `colors` project is used within more than 4 million other projects, and npmjs.org shows this npm package is dependent upon by 18,962 other packages.

The following are a handful of projects that depend upon `colors`:

* The [prompt](https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/prompt) command-line helper (~500,000 weekly downloads)
* Unicode table formatting [cli-table3](https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/cli-table3) (~7 million weekly downloads)
* AWS’s own [aws-cdk](https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/aws-cdk) (~2 million weekly downloads)

In fact, the broken `colors@1.4.1` version impacts a large amount of users and is not to be taken lightly. According to the package page statistics on npmjs, we learn that this version has been downloaded 95,397 times at the time of writing this blog post:

![wordpress-sync/image1-28](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663712447%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fimage1-28.png&w=2560&q=75)
## The breaking code

The following offending code was introduced to the vulnerable `colors` library:

```
1for (let i = 666; i < Infinity; i++;) {
2   if (i % 333) {
3       // console.log('testing'.zalgo.rainbow)
4   }
5   console.log('testing testing testing testing testing testing testing'.zalgo)
6}
```

This infinite loop code, located in the `index.js` file of the package’s source code will break any usage of the package while printing some very unsettling zalgo text to the terminal:

![wordpress-sync/image5-10](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663712447%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fimage5-10.png&w=2560&q=75)
## I am dependent on this `colors` package, what should I do to mitigate this?

If you are currently impacted by the `colors` incident due to using the broken version `1.4.1`, we recommend that you revert back to the latest known-good `colors@1.4.0` version which doesn’t include the offending infinite loop code. For example, to pin down the stable and safe version of the `colors` package in your `package.json` file, replace the following:

```
1"colors":"^1.4.0"
```

with:

```
1"colors":"1.4.0"
```

For a future reference, we recommend the following best practices to be taken with managing open source libraries in your projects:

1. Pin your dependencies, either in your `package.json` or by using a lockfile. This will help you avoid install-time resolutions of newer versions, which would’ve exposed you to install the `1.4.1` patched version of `colors` that introduced the issue.
2. This incident should prompt you to consider moving to an alternative color handling package, such as [chalk](https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/chalk).
3. Review the maintenance and sustainability aspects of open source packages you are intending to use, and ensure they have a proper governance model, such as multiple contributors.

## Faker.js: Same maintainer, same story?

This event follows a similar incident related to the popular npm package faker (known broadly as [Faker.js](https://github.com/Marak/faker.js/)), maintained by the same person. Faker is a project used by many developers to generative massive amounts of fake data, such that is commonly used in software testing practices.

Faker receives 2 million weekly downloads, and is also quite popular as a dependency for JavaScript and Node.js projects. However, on January 5th, 2022, the open source repository on GitHub for this package received a forced commit which completely reverted the package’s original source code:

![wordpress-sync/image3-19](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663712447%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fimage3-19.png&w=2560&q=75)

Respectively, the `faker` npm package version has been promoted to `6.6.6`, and published to the public npmjs registry as an empty package which contains no source code.

![wordpress-sync/image6-14](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663712457%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fimage6-14.png&w=2560&q=75)

The maintainer [created an issue](https://web.archive.org/web/20210704022108/https%3A//github.com/Marak/faker.js/issues/1046) stating that they will no longer maintain the package for free:

![wordpress-sync/image2-29](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663712448%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fimage2-29.png&w=2560&q=75)

The author later removed the GitHub repository sourcing the project, likely causing a large disruption to thousands of developers using this package, now potentially seeking migration paths.

Later, they published an [article](https://web.archive.org/web/20210628030444/https%3A//marak.com/blog/2021-04-25-monetizing-open-source-is-problematic) regarding the matter in their personal blog, fleshing out the failed attempts at getting the project monetized or sponsored, expressing that the current state of donations is unsustainable and that "*Like most of us, I have people who depend on me and I have bills to pay*".

As the same maintainer takes part in about 170 other npm packages, this very well may not be the end of this story.

## Dangers of open source governance and funding models

This event follows a general trend in the open source community, regarding the liability of companies and organizations that depend on open source code in production to build their products.

Following the release of the offending code in `colors`, the maintainer also opened a GitHub issue themselves, discussing the matter, in which they generally joke about not being able to find the cause of this “bug” and not having time to handle it.

![wordpress-sync/image7-9](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663712448%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fimage7-9.png&w=2560&q=75)

Marak continues by tagging other highly prolific Node.js developers to help out with the matter, but none of them has real access to the project repository:

![wordpress-sync/image4-16](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663712447%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fimage4-16.png&w=2560&q=75)

These incidents fall in line with a recent trend of discussion in the open source community, with more and more open source maintainers expressing their dissatisfaction with corporations and organizations monetizing and using open source software in their products.

[Responding to open source criticism post-Log4Shell](/blog/responding-to-open-source-criticism-post-log4shell/), we recently addressed maintainers' hardships in sustaining healthy open source software without funding.

We may observe a continuing trend of maintainers completely blocking off access to their packages. While the sentiment is definitely understandable and the arguments valid, it should be noted that this approach of blocking access to open source packages will also result in hurting other open source developers and maintainers.

## Adopting open source security best practices

Using open source software means we need to properly assess the risks of such incidents, and other security, and legal issues, and be well prepared to handle as they unfold. Even better, if we can adopt best practices to avoid and mitigate potential supply chain security issues.

We recommend the following practices and reading content to better position yourself in future situations like this:

1. You should review the maintenance and sustainability status of open source projects. The [Snyk Advisor](https://snyk.io/advisor/), is such a tool that helps to gauge a package's health score.
2. [10 npm Security Best Practices](/blog/ten-npm-security-best-practices/) mentions the importance of enabling two-factor authentication, pinning down dependencies with proper lockfile usage, and others.
3. Read up on [securing your modern software supply chain](/blog/software-supply-chain-security/) with topics like dependency confusion, typosquatting and malicious packages
4. Practical advice on how Snyk helps [preventing malicious packages and supply chain attacks](/blog/preventing-malicious-packages-and-supply-chain-attacks-with-snyk/)

| Woah, crazy bug! Glad to know you are working on it. Just reinstalled the Live Server package because I came across this while trying to host a project over localhost. Tracked my way to the new `american.js` file here in your project because something related to this issue happened while starting the server. Really freaked me out! 😂  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65947371/148632459-55f818b0-1ee4-4ddf-b53a-defe656c1d81.png) |

| Alright, figured out how to temporarily fix the issue for use with Live Server. The `package.json` for Live Server has Colors.js set to use the newest possible version available, `latest`, so I changed it back to the most recent Colors.js version that didn't have the issue, `1.4.0`. Just thought I'd share a fix for anyone else that may also run into this too 👍 |

| Is it an option that, in the meantime, you could revert your project back to `1.4.0`, the release before the new change was introduced? This seemed to fix all of the issues on my end. A lot of large projects appear to be requiring your dependency, and they have the version number set to use the `latest` release. |

As much as we'd like to revert back to a previous working version, we strongly feel it's best if we can fix the actual problem instead of going back in time.

| Yeah, changing the version number to an older release would fix it, but there are many projects out there that haven't been updated in multiple years, I don't think the devs for them will be around to change the Colors.js dependency not to use `latest` any time soon, [Live Server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) could be an example.

| [@Marak](https://github.com/Marak) , It looks like you removed me from this repo so I'm unable to help. I can only imagine everything you're going through right now, but there are a bunch of other OSS devs like you who get hurt by pranks like this, rather than the big tech elite etc. that I think you are trying to go after. I'd be happy to help here, but please be willing to not harm the folks who would otherwise be on your side. |

| For anyone who is affected, here are ways to check, which packages have to pin the version (the ones which directly use `colors`):  for npm:  ``` npm ls colors  ```  for yarn:  ``` yarn why colors  ```  In some cases you can use resolutions: <https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/> <https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-force-resolutions>  And in some you can easily apply a patch to remove the relevant code parts with patch-package: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/patch-package> |

Don't dislike this comment you guys if you don't support him, it's my personal opinion and I have the right to support him, and he has the right to make and destroy codes. More happy because this method did SHAKE the whole social media and blogs, and his message to fortune companies definitely went to them!    The vast majority of "support" comes from anonymous accounts with little to no contributions to open source themselves. You have continued to shill and throw random support towards Marak with no understanding of what "trust" is.    You say you "trust" Marak still now. What do you "trust" him to do?    At this point, I'm convinced you are just an alt account of Marak's that being using to stir the pot.  Me? An alt? Oh I didn't knew I had the chance to call myself such a popular person! Anyways I am the owner of [@rovelstars](https://github.com/rovelstars) org. Deal with it 😎  And I'm a owner of [@labdiscord](https://github.com/labdiscord). Most of us are owners of an organization. Humble yourself.. and what the hell is RovelStars anyways?  And what's LabDiscord?  😂 Thanks for dealing with that guy. I myself posted my org to prove that I'm not an alt of Marak, and I don't care whether my organization is that popular or not, but it has a 120 stars repo, enough to proove that im not an alt of Marak.

| So the long story short: guy published software under fully open license which allowed commercial usage, abandoned the project so other people supported it literally for years, project became very popular at some point, guy developed jealousy because it was non-profit and decided to break the project.  Except it’s extremely unprofessional and childish behavior (it’s not activism, fellow developers, because big companies wouldn’t even notice it, since dependencies are on strict control there):   1. Marak fully mimicked behavior of “evil corps” by destroying 2 projects which were founded by him, yes, but maintained by many other people, basically saying “I own it and don’t care about your efforts”; 2. As it was said tons of times he could’ve changed licensing to non-commercial;   I’m deeply disappointed by this situation and happy to see that community now leads those projects. |

| Except it’s extremely unprofessional and childish behavior (it’s not activism, fellow developers, because big companies wouldn’t even notice it, since dependencies are on strict control there):  *Big companies* would notice that by failing tests, and the shitstorm towards this package, otherwise GitHub wouldn't even block his account in first place (there's actual backdoored packages and just outdated packages with vulnerabilites).  1. Marak fully mimicked behavior of “evil corps” by destroying 2 projects which were founded by him, yes, but maintained by many other people, basically saying “I own it and don’t care about your efforts”;  That's the issue with OSS, ex. lead maintainer could crap your for your patch and that's it.  2. As it was said tons of times he could’ve changed licensing to non-commercial;  Then *Big companies* will just fork from previous version and then just make original package obsolete, that'll be undesirable for Marak.  I’m deeply disappointed by this situation and happy to see that community now leads those projects.  I'm disappointed by reaction of devs, that reminds me of the similarity of cancel culture and apostasy in islam. |

| Looking at the date of this (January 7th), I assume this has something to do with the attacks on January 6th? The public hearing was today, so what a fitting time to say — fix this. Don't ruin your project because of your political opinions.  And if, by some chance, this is about something else? Fix it regardless. |
