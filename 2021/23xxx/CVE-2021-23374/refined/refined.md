- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `kill` function in the `ps-visitor` package uses the `child_process.exec` function without proper input sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary command injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user input passed to `child_process.exec`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server by controlling the input to the `kill` function.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can inject arbitrary commands via the `kill` function by providing malicious input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `kill` function, which would typically involve interaction with the application using the vulnerable package.
