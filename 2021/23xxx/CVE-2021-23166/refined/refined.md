Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-23166:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **incorrect access control** within the Odoo application. Specifically, the `psycopg2` library, which Odoo uses to interact with the PostgreSQL database, can be abused to access local server files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **File System Access:** The primary weakness is that the `psycopg2` library can be manipulated to read and write local files on the server where Odoo is running.
*   **Insufficient Sandboxing:** The application lacks proper sandboxing mechanisms, allowing a privileged user to break out of the intended environment and interact with the underlying file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** A malicious administrator can read sensitive files stored on the server. This could include protected configuration files or other confidential data.
*   **Data Modification:**  The attacker can modify sensitive files, potentially leading to a system compromise or other malicious activity.
*   **System Compromise:** By gaining access to critical system files, the attacker could potentially achieve broader control over the server.
*  **Lateral Movement:** In hosted environments, the vulnerability could allow for access to other databases or resources if the hosting provider doesn't have proper isolation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Exploitable:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged User Account:** The attacker must have an administrator-level account within the Odoo instance.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to access the Odoo instance over the network.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Odoo Community and Enterprise editions version 15.0 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability is considered to have a high CVSS3 score of 8.7, with a vector of `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N`.
*   No workaround is available. Applying the provided patch is strongly recommended.
*   Odoo cloud servers were patched when the fix became available.
*   Patches are available for versions 13.0, 14.0, and 15.0.
