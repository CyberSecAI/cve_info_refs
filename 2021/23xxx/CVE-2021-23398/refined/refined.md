Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `react-bootstrap-table` library's handling of the `dataFormat` function. When a user-provided function within `dataFormat` returns an invalid React element, the library resorts to using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to render the content. This method bypasses sanitization, enabling the injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is the lack of proper sanitization when rendering data within the table. By injecting malicious code through the `dataFormat` function, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the user's browser.
*   **Unsafe use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`:** The library's fallback to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is the primary cause of the XSS vulnerability. This function bypasses React's typical safeguards and directly inserts HTML into the DOM, which can be exploited for XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser.
*   **Cookie Stealing/Session Hijacking:** As a common impact of XSS, attackers can steal cookies, enabling them to hijack user sessions.
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** XSS can be used to expose sensitive user information.
*   **Malware Delivery:** Attackers can use XSS to deliver malware to users' browsers.
*   **Access to Privileged Services:** Successful XSS attacks can enable access to privileged services and functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **`dataFormat` Function:** The primary attack vector is through the `dataFormat` function. By injecting malicious HTML/JavaScript code within the data being processed by this function, an attacker can execute the script.
*   **User-Supplied Data:**  The vulnerability is present when data displayed in the table is user-supplied or can be manipulated by a malicious actor, and not properly sanitized.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Inject Malicious Data:** An attacker needs the ability to inject or modify the data that will be passed to the `dataFormat` function, or provide a malicious `dataFormat` function.
*   **No Special Privileges Required:** No special privileges are needed. The attack can be carried out remotely.
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required for the vulnerability to be exploited. The user must view the table containing the malicious content, which will then execute the injected script in the user's browser.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Michael Rodov.
*   The vulnerable code is located in `react-bootstrap-table/src/TableBody.js`
*   The issue is present in all versions of the `react-bootstrap-table` package as of the time the information was published.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) clearly shows how to inject malicious code through the `dataFormat` function.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-23398.

**Summary:**

The `react-bootstrap-table` library is vulnerable to XSS due to unsafe handling of user-provided `dataFormat` functions. When these functions do not return a valid React element, the library uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without proper sanitization, allowing injection of malicious code.
