Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to a regular expression used in the parsing logic that is susceptible to backtracking when processing crafted input strings, leading to a denial-of-service (ReDoS).

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability due to an inefficient regular expression used in the parsing logic.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can cause the application to become unresponsive by providing specific input that triggers excessive backtracking within the regular expression engine, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

Attack vectors:
- Sending specially crafted input strings to the vulnerable function

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs the ability to send data to the vulnerable application that is processed by the vulnerable regular expression. This can be achieved remotely through network requests. No special privileges or user interaction are required.
