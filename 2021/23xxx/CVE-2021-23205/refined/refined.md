- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper encoding or escaping in Gallagher Command Centre Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper encoding or escaping of user inputs, specifically those related to controller and hardware configuration. This allows a user to modify parameters that are outside the scope of their assigned privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A Command Centre Operator with low privileges can alter the configuration of controllers and other hardware items, potentially leading to unauthorized access, denial of service, or other security breaches.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through the Command Centre Server interface and involves a malicious operator manipulating the system's configuration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a Command Centre Operator with a valid, but limited, user account. This implies the attacker must have legitimate access to the system.
