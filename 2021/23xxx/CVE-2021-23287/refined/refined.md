- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient validation of input of certain resources within the Eaton Intelligent Power Manager (IPM) software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS). The advisory explicitly references CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting').
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to a high impact on integrity and availability, while confidentiality is not directly affected.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable via adjacent access (AV:A), requiring a high level of privileges (PR:H), user interaction (UI:R), and the scope of the vulnerability is unchanged (S:U).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable system, possess high privileges within the IPM application, and induce a user interaction to trigger the stored XSS.
