Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23986:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from how Firefox handles favicons for custom search engines added via browser extensions. A malicious extension could install a search engine with a `favicon_url` pointing to a cross-origin resource. Firefox would then fetch this resource and convert it to a `data:` URI, which is then accessible to the extension without proper Same-Origin Policy (SOP) enforcement.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Same-Origin Policy Bypass:** The core issue is that the extension could bypass the SOP, which is designed to prevent scripts from one origin from accessing data from a different origin.
*   **Lack of Content Type Validation:** The `SearchEngine` component fetches favicons without proper validation of the content type, leading to the ability to load non-image resources and make their content accessible to the extension.
*   **Favicon URL Handling:** The processing of the favicon URL, especially the conversion to a `data:` URI, was performed without appropriate checks and permissions restrictions.
*   **Implicit Permissions:** The `search` permission granted to the extension did not accurately convey the risk of cross-origin data leakage through favicon retrieval.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A malicious extension could read the content of cross-origin resources, including resources on the local network or resources that use IP-based authentication.
*   **Limited Credential Exposure:** The cross-origin requests made for the favicon do not include cookies or other credentials, mitigating the risk of an attacker accessing session-based user data.
*   **Potential for Local Network Probing:** The vulnerability allows the reading of resources on the user's local network, which could expose sensitive internal systems and services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Extension:** An attacker needs to create and distribute a malicious Firefox extension.
*   **Search Provider Manipulation:** The extension must use the `chrome_settings_overrides.search_provider` manifest key to add a search engine with a malicious `favicon_url`.
*   **`browser.search` API:** The extension then uses the `browser.search.get()` API to retrieve the search engine and access the favicon data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Extension Development:** The attacker needs the technical skill to develop a malicious web extension for Firefox.
*   **Extension Distribution:** The attacker needs a means to distribute and persuade users to install their malicious extension.
*   **No Network Access Required:** The attack does not require direct network access to the user's machine, as it exploits vulnerabilities within the browser itself.
*   **Search Permission:** The malicious extension must request the `search` permission.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was initially addressed by checking that the content type of the favicon resource was an `image/*` type. However, it was found that this check could be bypassed using a 30x redirect, causing the check to be performed on the original response instead of the final one after the redirect. This issue was addressed in bug 1694183 which is linked in this bug's details.
*   The fix involves ensuring that only resources with a valid image content type are accepted as favicons by the search service.
* The reporter of this bug was awarded a security bounty.
