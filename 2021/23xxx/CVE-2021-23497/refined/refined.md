Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23497:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a prototype pollution issue arising from an incomplete fix of a previous prototype pollution vulnerability. The `set` function in the `@strikeentco/set` package does not properly sanitize or validate input paths, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the `Object.prototype`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incomplete fix:** The initial fix for a prior vulnerability was insufficient and could be bypassed by providing an array instead of a string for the property path.
- **Type confusion:** The code was not strictly checking the type of the path components. When an array is used as a property key, it's coerced to a string, thus bypassing the original fix that checked for string values like '__proto__' or 'constructor'.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the `Object.prototype` with unexpected values, it can lead to JavaScript exceptions and cause a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In cases where the codebase evaluates object attributes and then executes them, the attacker could potentially inject malicious code.
- **Property Injection:** Attackers can manipulate properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `set` function is called with a path that contains the `__proto__` property (or `constructor`) within an array and a malicious value. 
- Specifically, the `set` function did not properly handle array inputs for property paths, which allowed an attacker to bypass the protection against setting `__proto__` by passing `['__proto__']`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to control the path parameter passed to the vulnerable `set` function in order to inject properties into the prototype.
-  The attacker does not require any privileges, as the vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the network.
- No user interaction is required.

**Additional details:**

- The Snyk blog post details how type confusion in JavaScript can be used to bypass input validations. It describes how arrays can be used to bypass checks that are expecting strings, using the differences between strict equality (`===`) and loose equality (`==`) operators, and how object property accessors can be manipulated using bracket notation with non-string keys that are coerced to strings.
- The vulnerability was present in versions of `@strikeentco/set` before 1.0.2.
- The fix was introduced in version 1.0.2, which converts the path components to strings if they aren't strings or numbers before checking against dangerous properties like `__proto__`.

**Summary**
CVE-2021-23497 is a prototype pollution vulnerability due to a flawed fix in `@strikeentco/set`. By exploiting type confusion, attackers could inject malicious properties into `Object.prototype`, leading to a range of impacts from DoS to potential RCE and data tampering. The vulnerability was resolved by the maintainers by ensuring that path components are converted to strings before being checked against sensitive properties.
