# Argo CD leaked secret data into error messages and logs on invalid edits via UI

Moderate

[alexmt](/alexmt)
published
GHSA-fp89-h8pj-8894
Mar 15, 2021

## Package

Argo CD

## Affected versions

All versions prior to 1.7.14 and 1.8.7

## Patched versions

1.7.14, 1.8.7

## Description

### Impact

When a user with `update` permissions to an Application was editing a `Secret` resources's manifest in the UI with invalid input (e.g. adding a new key with a value not encoded in base64), Argo CD would print the contents of the `Secret` as an error message in JSON format.

As this error message is user visible, this was effectively circumventing the redaction feature of Argo CD. Also, as this error message is being logged, the plain-text contents of the `Secret` ended up in the log files and possibly, in log management systems.

### Patches

Patches for this issue have been released with the `v1.7.14` and `v1.8.7` versions of Argo CD.

### Workarounds

No workaround available.

### References

N/A

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
