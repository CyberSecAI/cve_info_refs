Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23135:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of error messages when a user attempts to edit a `Secret` resource in the Argo CD UI with invalid input. Specifically, if a new key is added with a value that is not base64 encoded, Argo CD would print the entire contents of the `Secret` in JSON format within the error message.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Information Leakage:** The primary weakness is the leakage of sensitive data. By displaying the `Secret`'s contents in the error message, Argo CD bypasses its own redaction features, exposing sensitive information that should remain hidden.
- **Logging Sensitive Data:** The error message containing the `Secret` is also logged, meaning the plaintext contents can end up in log files and potentially in log management systems, further increasing the risk of exposure.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Breach:** The most significant impact is the exposure of sensitive data stored within Kubernetes `Secret` resources. This could include credentials, API keys, or other sensitive information.
- **Lateral Movement/Privilege Escalation:** Exposed secrets could be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to other systems or resources within the cluster or related infrastructure.

**Attack vectors:**

- **UI Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered through the Argo CD UI.
- **Invalid Input:** The attack requires a user with update permissions to an Application to introduce invalid input while editing a `Secret` resource.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Argo CD Access:** An attacker needs access to the Argo CD UI.
- **`Update` Permissions:** The attacker must have `update` permissions for an Application managed by Argo CD.
- **Knowledge of Invalid Input:** The attacker must be able to trigger the error message by providing invalid input while editing a `Secret` resource (e.g., adding a key with a non-base64 encoded value).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Argo CD versions prior to 1.7.14 and 1.8.7.
- Patches are available in versions 1.7.14 and 1.8.7.
- The CVSS score is 5.9 (Moderate), with a local attack vector, low attack complexity, low privileges required, user interaction required, scope changed, high confidentiality impact, and no impact on integrity or availability.
