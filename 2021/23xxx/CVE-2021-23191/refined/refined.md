  "CVE-2021-23191": {
    "description": "A security issue was found in htmldoc v1.9.12 and before. A NULL pointer dereference in the function image_load_jpeg() in image.cxx may result in denial of service.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a NULL pointer dereference in the `image_load_jpeg()` function when loading a JPEG image in `image.cxx`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) or possibly code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local file processing"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted HTML document that uses the htmldoc library to process a malformed JPEG image file.",
    "additional_details": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered during the loading of a JPEG image. The root cause is related to error handling within libjpeg or libjpeg-turbo that doesn't properly handle exceptions using setjmp/longjmp in the JPEG error handler",
        "The vulnerability is exploitable if a user processes a crafted HTML file containing a malformed JPEG image with htmldoc.",
          "The fix involves implementing proper error handling of JPEG images and aborting the read operation when errors occur to prevent a crash.",
        "The vulnerability was fixed in htmldoc version 1.9.12 via commit 369b2ea1fd0d0537ba707f20a2f047b6afd2fbdc, where the maintainer implemented the `longjmp` in the JPEG error handler."
