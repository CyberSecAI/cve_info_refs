- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Bosch software tools AccessIPConfig.exe and AmcIpConfig.exe do not properly enforce authentication when configuring AMC2 devices, allowing an attacker to bypass password protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authentication for critical function (CWE-306)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can manipulate the device's configuration or render it unresponsive, potentially disrupting access control.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through the AccessIPConfig.exe and AmcIpConfig.exe tools, which are used to configure AMC2 devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the local network, typically even the same subnet as the vulnerable device.
