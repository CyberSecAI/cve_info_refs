- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `Git.git` method in the `git` package lacks proper sanitization, allowing the execution of arbitrary OS commands instead of just `git` commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input sanitization leading to remote code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution, leading to total loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** Network, as the vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and can be exploited remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the system running the vulnerable application. High privileges are also required to execute the arbitrary OS commands. The vulnerability can be exploited without user interaction.
