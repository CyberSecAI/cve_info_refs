Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23435:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the `session[:return_to]` parameter within the `clearance` Ruby gem. Specifically, the application did not properly sanitize the URL provided in this session variable before redirecting the user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Open Redirect:** The core weakness is an open redirect vulnerability, which allows an attacker to redirect a user to an arbitrary external URL. The vulnerability arises when the `return_to` URL contains multiple leading slashes, e.g., `/////example.com`, which bypasses the intended redirect behavior and leads to redirection to the external domain.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Phishing:** Attackers can exploit the open redirect to redirect users to malicious websites, potentially for phishing attacks or to deliver malware.
- **Credential Theft:** The vulnerability could be used to mimic a login page on a malicious domain and steal credentials if users are tricked into logging in through the malicious link.
- **Reputation Damage:** The exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a loss of user trust and damage the application's reputation.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL provided in the `session[:return_to]` parameter.
- Attackers would manipulate the `return_to` URL, potentially through a URL parameter or other means, to include multiple leading slashes followed by a malicious domain.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to the application.
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the `session[:return_to]` parameter and trick a user into initiating a redirect with the malicious parameter.
- User interaction is required, as the victim needs to click on the malicious link.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in `clearance` version 2.5.0 and later by adding extra sanitization to remove multiple leading slashes.
- The CVSS score provided by Snyk is 7.6 (High), while the NVD score is 6.1 (Medium). This difference is likely because Snyk's scoring may take into account real-world scenarios and specific exploit vectors.
- The Snyk analysis indicates a high availability impact, meaning the attacker could potentially disrupt the application. While the confidentiality and integrity impacts are rated low, the redirection can still be used for significant harm.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-601 - URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect').
