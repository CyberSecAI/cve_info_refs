### @MottiniMauro **[MottiniMauro](/MottiniMauro)** commented [Aug 31, 2021](#issue-983339793)

An open redirect can be possible when users are able to set the value of

session[:return\_to]. If the value used for return\_to contains multiple

leading slashes (/////example.com) the user ends up being redirected the

external domain that comes after the slashes (<http://example.com>).

To fix this issue, extra sanitization was added when processing the

return\_to url, removing multiple leading slashes to avoid the open

redirect.

Sorry, something went wrong.

EPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

#### Introduced: 31 Aug 2021

[CVE-2021-23435 ¬†(opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-23435) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-601 ¬†(opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `clearance` to version 2.5.0 or higher.

## Overview

[clearance](https://rubygems.org/gems/clearance) is an authentication app for rails.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect. The vulnerability can be possible when users are able to set the value of `session[:return_to]`. If the value used for `return_to` contains multiple leading slashes (`/////example.com`) the user ends up being redirected to the external domain that comes after the slashes (`http://example.com`).

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.6¬†high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed ‚Äúremotely exploitable‚Äù and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. For example, a successful exploit may only be possible during the installation of an application by a system administrator.

  **Required**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).
