Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23682:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of keys when parsing the query string in the `getJsonFromUrl` function. This allows an attacker to inject properties into the prototype of an object.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Prototype Pollution: The application does not properly sanitize input, specifically the keys extracted from the query string, which allows an attacker to inject properties into the `__proto__` object. This can lead to unexpected behavior or potential security breaches.

**Impact of exploitation:**
By manipulating the prototype, an attacker could potentially:
- Modify the behavior of JavaScript objects
- Potentially inject malicious code
- Cause denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the query string of a URL. The attacker crafts a URL with a malicious query string containing `__proto__` which then gets parsed and used to set properties on an object, thus polluting the prototype.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No special privileges are required.
- No user interaction is required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in both `litespeed.js` and `appwrite/server-ce`
- The vulnerability in `litespeed.js` is fixed in version 0.3.12
- The vulnerability in `appwrite/server-ce` is fixed in versions 0.12.2 and 0.11.1
- The Snyk vulnerability report shows a CVSS score of 7.3, while NVD gives it a score of 9.8.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) is available to demonstrate the vulnerability by appending `?__proto__[polluted]=yes` to the URL.
- The fix in `litespeed.js` involves creating the object without prototype functionality by using `Object.create(null)` instead of using `{}` or `new Map()`.
