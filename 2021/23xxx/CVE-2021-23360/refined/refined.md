Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23360:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `killport` package uses the `child_process.exec` function to execute shell commands, which allows for arbitrary command injection.
*   The vulnerability occurs due to the lack of sanitization of the user-provided `port` input before it is incorporated into the shell command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary shell commands through the `port` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system where the vulnerable `killport` package is being used.
*   This can lead to a total loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system, as an attacker could steal data, modify files, or cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `port` parameter of the `killport` function.
*   By providing a crafted string containing shell commands as the port argument, an attacker can inject and execute commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the input of the `port` parameter passed to the `killport` function.
*   The attacker needs to be able to call the vulnerable function with user-controlled input.
*   The attack is classified as "Network" meaning that the vulnerable component is bound to the network stack, and the set of attackers can be from the entire Internet.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `index.js` where `child_process.exec` is used without proper input sanitization.
*   The fix is to upgrade to version `1.0.2` or higher, implying that sanitization is introduced or command execution is done in a safer way, which is confirmed by the commit message `fix a vulnerability issue if a provided port is not a number`
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-77 (Command Injection).
*   The CVSS score is 7.5 (High) from Snyk, and 8.8 (High) from NVD, confirming the high risk of the vulnerability.
*   A proof of concept (PoC) is provided showing how `touch success` can be executed when the crafted string `$(touch success); #` is provided as the port number.
