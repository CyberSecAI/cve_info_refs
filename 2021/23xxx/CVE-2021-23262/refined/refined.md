The provided content is related to CVE-2021-23262.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to improper control of dynamically-managed code resources and involves a Snakeyaml deserialization bypass.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources
- Snakeyaml deserialization vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the execution of arbitrary code or other malicious actions via the vulnerable deserialization process.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the manipulation of Snakeyaml deserialization process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would likely need to have the ability to influence or control the input that gets processed by Snakeyaml, or interact with the vulnerable component in a way that triggers the deserialization process using malicious input. The specific capabilities or position needed isn't given in the advisory but it's likely that the attacker would need some level of access to the system.
