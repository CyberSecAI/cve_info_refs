{
  "CVE-2021-23437": {
    "root_cause": "The `getrgb` function in the Pillow library is vulnerable to a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) attack due to an inefficient regular expression used to parse color strings.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)",
      "Inefficient regular expression processing"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service by providing a specially crafted, long color string that will cause the regex engine to perform excessive backtracking, leading to high CPU usage and making the system unresponsive.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing a specially crafted long color string to the `getrgb` function.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to pass a color string to the vulnerable `getrgb` function. This could be through a web application, file processing, or other methods where the Pillow library is used to process color strings."
