Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23968:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Firefox and Thunderbird handle Content Security Policy (CSP) violation reports when frame navigation is blocked due to the `frame-src` directive. When a frame attempts to load a URL that redirects, the browser was incorrectly reporting the *destination* URL of the redirect in the violation report instead of the original frame URI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Leakage: The primary weakness is the leakage of sensitive information embedded in redirect URLs. This violates the CSP specification, which mandates that such reports should not reveal more than the origin of the request pre-redirects.
- Incorrect URL Handling: The browser did not correctly identify and report the original requested URL before the redirect.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Sensitive Data Exposure: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information present in URLs, such as OAuth tokens or authorization codes.
- Cross-Site Information Disclosure: By crafting specific redirects and using CSP, attackers can obtain information that would not be available under normal circumstances.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Website: An attacker hosts a website that includes a CSP header.
- iframe Injection: The attacker's page attempts to load a target URL in an iframe, where the target URL triggers a redirect.
- CSP Violation Report: The browser generates a CSP violation report, inadvertently including the full destination URL of the redirect with sensitive information.
- Redirect Chaining: Attackers can potentially chain redirects and leak a full path by iframing each leaked URL in a new page with a CSP `frame-src` directive that matches the leaked URL's domain.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to serve a malicious web page with a controlled Content-Security-Policy header.
- Ability to induce a redirect from a controlled server.
- Ability to receive the CSP violation reports sent by the victim's browser.
