- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from improper user authorization within NVIDIA GeForce Experience's GameStream feature. GameStream fails to correctly apply individual user access controls for users on the same device.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the incorrect application of user access controls within the GameStream feature. This allows users to bypass intended restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
    - Escalation of privileges: A user may gain access to resources or functionalities beyond their intended permissions.
    - Information disclosure: Sensitive information might be exposed to unauthorized users.
    - Data tampering: An attacker could modify or corrupt data.
    - Denial of service: The system or services might be rendered unavailable.
    - Impact beyond GameStream: The impact extends beyond the intended security boundary of GameStream to other resources.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to be on the same device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires local access to the system and user intervention to exploit the vulnerability. The user also needs to have a low privilege level.
