- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `scroll` function in the `onion-oled-js` library uses the `child_process.exec` function without sanitizing user-controlled input, which allows for arbitrary command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Arbitrary command injection due to lack of input sanitization when using `child_process.exec`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system, potentially leading to full system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The `scroll` function of the `onion-oled-js` library is vulnerable. By providing malicious input to this function, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `scroll` function of the library. No specific privileges or user interaction is required.
