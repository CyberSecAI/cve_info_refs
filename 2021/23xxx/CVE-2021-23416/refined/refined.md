- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `curly-bracket-parser` package does not sanitize user input when used as a template library, allowing for Cross-site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site Scripting (XSS). The package fails to properly escape or sanitize user-provided data before including it in the output.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application. This can lead to:
    - Stealing cookies and hijacking user sessions.
    - Exposing sensitive information.
    - Access to privileged services and functionality.
    - Delivering malware.
- **Attack vectors**: Reflected XSS. The attacker delivers a malicious link to a user. When clicked, the malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload and entice a user to click on it. The attacker does not need any prior access to the application or server.
