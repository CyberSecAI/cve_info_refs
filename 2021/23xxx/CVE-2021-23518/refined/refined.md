Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23518:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is due to improper initialization of the `cache` object within the `cachedPathRelative` function. Instead of using `Object.create(null)` to create a prototype-less object, it uses `{}` which inherits from `Object.prototype`. This allows an attacker to inject properties into the prototype chain.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The `cache` object in `cached-path-relative` is vulnerable to prototype pollution. By using a crafted input like `__proto__` as the `from` parameter in `cachedPathRelative(from, to)`, an attacker can modify the `Object.prototype`, leading to potential vulnerabilities in other parts of the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Modifying critical properties or functions on `Object.prototype` can cause JavaScript exceptions, leading to a denial of service. For example, polluting `Object.prototype.toString` with an integer would cause failures in code relying on `someobject.toString()`.
*  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In scenarios where the application evaluates attributes of an object (e.g., using `eval`), an attacker can pollute `Object.prototype` with malicious code to achieve RCE.
*  **Property Injection:** An attacker can inject properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value (including security properties like cookies or tokens), thereby gaining unauthorized privileges. For instance, if a codebase checks `someuser.isAdmin`, an attacker can set `Object.prototype.isAdmin` to true.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is via the `cachedPathRelative` function which is exposed by the package.
*   By controlling the `from` and `to` parameters, particularly using `__proto__` as `from` parameter, an attacker can inject properties into the `Object.prototype` through the cache object.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the input parameters to the `cachedPathRelative` function.
*   No special privileges or user interaction are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability is a result of an incomplete fix of a previous prototype pollution vulnerability (CVE-2018-16472).
* The fix for this vulnerability involves modifying the way the cache is created in the `cachedPathRelative` function to use `Object.create(null)`.
* The vulnerability is present in versions of `cached-path-relative` prior to 1.1.0.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to version 1.1.0 or higher.
*   Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.
*   Use schema validation of JSON input.
*   Freeze the prototype using `Object.freeze(Object.prototype)`.
*   Consider using objects without prototypes (e.g., `Object.create(null)`).
*   Use `Map` instead of `Object`.
