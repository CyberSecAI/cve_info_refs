- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the `meta_driver_srv.js` class with the `saveDriverData` action using an invalidated `driverID`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can delete files on the system where the IPM software is installed.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted packets to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network access to the IPM software. No authentication is required.
