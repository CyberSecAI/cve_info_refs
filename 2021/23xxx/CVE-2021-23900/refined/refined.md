Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23900:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The OWASP json-sanitizer library, prior to version 1.2.2, had flaws in its input sanitization logic. It could emit closing SCRIPT tags and CDATA section delimiters for crafted input. Additionally, the library could output invalid JSON or throw undeclared exceptions for certain crafted inputs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **HTML/XML Injection:** The library fails to properly sanitize specific inputs, leading to the potential injection of arbitrary HTML or XML into embedding documents via the output of closing `</script>` tags and `]]>` CDATA delimiters.
2.  **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crafted input can cause the library to output invalid JSON or throw undeclared exceptions. If an application using the library is not prepared to handle such conditions, it could lead to a denial of service.
3.  **Incorrect Number parsing**: The library could be tricked into outputting incorrect numbers due to issues with parsing hex, octal, and decimal numbers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **HTML/XML Injection:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into web pages, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, session hijacking, and other malicious activities.
2.  **Denial of Service:** An attacker could cause an application using the json-sanitizer library to crash or become unresponsive, impacting availability of the service.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves providing crafted, malicious input to the json-sanitizer library. This input could contain specific combinations of characters and escape sequences designed to trigger the vulnerabilities.
Specifically, inputs that contain sequences of characters that could be interpreted as `</script>` tags, CDATA delimiters, or malformed numbers.
Fuzzing was used to discover many of the input vectors.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the json-sanitizer library, either directly or indirectly through an application that uses the library.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing by Fabian Meumertzheim.
*   The fix for the vulnerability was released in version 1.2.2 of the `com.mikesamuel:json-sanitizer` library.
*   The commit `a37f594f7378a1c76b3283e0dab9e1ab1dc0247e` on GitHub contains tests to reproduce the fuzzer findings, but it does not contain the actual code fixes.

The provided information gives a good picture of the vulnerability, which appears to be more comprehensive than what one might expect from a basic CVE description.
