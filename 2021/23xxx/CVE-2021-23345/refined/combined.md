| Expected Behavior  * When attempting to convert html into a PDF using the /html endpoint, gotenberg should throw an exception (respond with a bad request) whenever there is an attempt to convert html with a source (src) reference to an internal system file. * [HTTP POST] /convert/html * [BODY] file: index.html >> test blank html <iframe src='file:///etc/passwd'> * [RESPONSE] 400 Bad Request (request was improperly formed - or something similar)  Current Behavior  * [HTTP POST] /convert/html * [BODY] file: index.html >> test blank html <iframe src='file:///etc/passwd'> * [RESPONSE] (contents of the etc/password directory   [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10346004/100141316-3b350280-2e60-11eb-85e2-6491b152ecef.png) [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10346004/100141369-5273f000-2e60-11eb-9e7f-0caa22406a0c.png) Possible Solution  * Respond with a bad request. Or something that indicates the requested operation is not allowed or prohibited. * Check the contents of the HTML file being uploaded to determine if similar file:// protocols are referenced   The use of server-side requests must be limited to specific scenarios required by the application and servers must be hardened to only allow those requests. SSRF can be remediated using a variety of standard web application protections, such as:   1. Limit service types via input validation on user input: Analyze if the application must use URI/ URL in requests and if not, disallow them. When a use case requires URIs and URLs in requests, perform input validation on URI/URLs using whitelists or robust blacklists. For example, only allow URL schemes such as HTTP/HTTPS which are often required for accessing applications. Disable all other URL schemas such as file://, dict://, gopher://, ftp://. Alternatively, create a token based forwarding for SSRs which may eliminate the use of URIs altogether. 2. Limit service interactions: Carefully analyze if the server requires interactions with external servers. Based on the use case, prevent unintended behavior in one of the following ways: External service interactions required: If the server is to perform interactions with external services, the server must be hardened to safely eliminate calls to services available on the local loopback adapter and prevent any calls from the server to other internal systems. 3. External service interactions not required: If the server is to only interact with local services, configure outbound firewall rules to check any calls being made from the application. The rules must limit the web server's interaction with other hosts by routing traffic only to specified resources on the local network; i.e., web servers must disallow connections to any host not included in the whitelist.  Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)  1. Configure Postman to use a proxy tool such as Burp Suite. 2. Create an HTML file using the below data: test blank html <iframe src='file:///etc/passwd'> 3. Toggle Burp Intercept on. 4. Upload this HTML file and make a request to the "Converter" endpoint. 5. Forward the intercepted request to Repeater and hit send. 6. In Repeater > response section, right click and select "show response in browser". 7. Open the response in a browser. 8. Note that the PDF file contains contents of /etc/passwd file.

| Hello [@etsms](https://github.com/etsms),  Thanks for this well-written issue!  It's already on my TODO list 👍 AFAIK, it would be possible to check each requests done by Google Chrome and prevent loading "unsafe" ones. |

| Is this not mitigated by the fact that, that the process runs inside of the docker container? Which has no access to anything outside of the container? |

| [@serge-melis](https://github.com/serge-melis) yes exactly. I had to prove to our security teams that it lives in a container and is short-lived. I was able to reduce the criticality of the finding by communicating that much. However, it'll stay a vulnerability until the software is patched (or updated) with a feature to disable local file navigation in the chrome driver (eg. no access to the etc/passwords path). So that's good news. As [@gulien](https://github.com/gulien) said earlier, its not (should not) publicly accessible and the client/requesters should be known and authorized.  So the risk is pretty low at this point.  BUT - a savvy hacker may find away around those other controls and ultimately pull/read sensitive information from the container. Hypothetical.... but this is the way security folks think. I'm certainly not a hacker pro. |

| Wow, that's an interesting one :) If Chrome doesn't support such filtering out of the box, I think it could be done using some sort of proxy for Chrome. Like [Privoxy](http://www.privoxy.org), for example. But I don't know, does Chrome use proxy settings for `file` protocol? |

### Threat Intelligence

EPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

[CVE-2021-23345  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-23345) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-918  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `github.com/thecodingmachine/gotenberg` to version 7.0.0 or higher.

## Overview

[github.com/thecodingmachine/gotenberg](http://github.com/thecodingmachine/gotenberg) is a Docker-powered stateless API for PDF files.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) via the `/convert/html` endpoint when the `src` attribute of an HTML element refers to an internal system file, such as `<iframe src='file:///etc/passwd'>`.

**NOTE:** This vulnerability has also been identified as: [CVE-2020-14161](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMTHECODINGMACHINEGOTENBERG-6056402)

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.3 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**
