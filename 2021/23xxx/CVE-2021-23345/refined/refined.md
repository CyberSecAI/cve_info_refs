Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23345:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `/convert/html` endpoint of the Gotenberg application. It allows the processing of user-supplied HTML content, including `<iframe>` tags with `src` attributes referencing local files using the `file://` protocol.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application processes the provided HTML and attempts to load resources specified by the `src` attribute of an `<iframe>` tag. This allows an attacker to potentially read local files from the server.
- **Lack of input validation/sanitization:** The application does not adequately validate or sanitize the provided HTML, leading to the interpretation of the file protocol.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read arbitrary local files on the server, potentially gaining access to sensitive data such as configuration files, credentials, or other system information.
- **Confidentiality Loss:** As stated in the provided Snyk data, there is a loss of confidentiality when exploiting this vulnerability due to access to restricted information.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTML payload with an `<iframe>` tag including the file protocol in the `src` attribute to the `/convert/html` endpoint.
- The attack is performed over the network since the vulnerable component is bound to it and is remotely exploitable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `/convert/html` endpoint of the Gotenberg application. No authentication is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was reported in GitHub issue #261 and fixed in pull request #319.
- The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 7.0.0 of the `github.com/thecodingmachine/gotenberg` package.
- The vulnerability has also been identified as CVE-2020-14161.
- While the application is intended to run inside a Docker container, an attacker can still read local files from the container.
- The vulnerability is considered medium severity (CVSS score 5.3).
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by upgrading the package to version 7.0.0 or higher.
- The exploit does not require any user interaction or special privileges.
-  The fix includes checks to prevent loading "unsafe" requests done by the browser, addressing the SSRF vulnerability.
