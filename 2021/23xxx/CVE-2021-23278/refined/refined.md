- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in `server/maps_srv.js` (with action `removeBackground`) and `server/node_upgrade_srv.js` (with action `removeFirmware`).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation leading to arbitrary file deletion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can delete files on the system where the IPM software is installed.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted packets to the vulnerable endpoints.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Authenticated user with network access to the IPM software.
