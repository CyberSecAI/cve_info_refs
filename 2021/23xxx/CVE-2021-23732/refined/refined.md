Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-23732

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies within the `docker-cli-js` Node.js package. The `Docker.command` method takes a `command` parameter, which, if controllable by a user, allows arbitrary OS commands to be executed on the host system. This happens because the input is not properly sanitized before being passed to the underlying shell.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary operating system commands.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The `command` parameter within the `Docker.command` function doesn't sanitize user-provided input, leading to command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Disclosure of Sensitive Information:** Attackers could potentially access confidential data on the host system.
- **Addition or Modification of Data:** Malicious actors could alter or inject data into the compromised system.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation could lead to system unavailability.
- **Complete loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability:** As mentioned in CVSS scores section.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** According to the CVSS vector, the vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- The `command` parameter of the `Docker.command` function in the `docker-cli-js` library is vulnerable to command injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to control at least partially the `command` parameter passed to the `Docker.command` method of the vulnerable `docker-cli-js` package.
- The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction.

**Additional Details:**
- The `docker-cli-js` package is used by multiple NetApp products.
- NetApp has confirmed that multiple of their products incorporate this vulnerable package.
- There is no fix yet for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 9.0 (Critical) with a vector of AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.
