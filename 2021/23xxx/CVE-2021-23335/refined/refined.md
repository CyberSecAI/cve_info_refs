Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23335:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the `is-user-valid` npm package when constructing LDAP queries. Specifically, user-provided input is directly incorporated into the LDAP query without escaping or sanitization, making it susceptible to injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **LDAP Injection:** The primary vulnerability is LDAP injection. By crafting malicious input, an attacker can manipulate the LDAP query, potentially bypassing authentication or exposing sensitive information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Authentication bypass:** Attackers may be able to bypass authentication by injecting crafted LDAP filter conditions that evaluate to true, granting unauthorized access.
- **Information exposure:** The attacker may be able to modify the LDAP query to retrieve sensitive information that they would not normally have access to.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerable component is accessible via the network, meaning that an attacker can exploit it remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the application using the vulnerable component.
- **No privileges required:** The attacker does not need any prior access to the system.
- **No user interaction:** Exploitation does not require any interaction from a user.
