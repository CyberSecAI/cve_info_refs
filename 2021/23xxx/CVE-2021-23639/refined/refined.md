Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23639:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `md-to-pdf` package used the `gray-matter` library to parse front matter in Markdown files. By default, `gray-matter` exposes a JavaScript engine that allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the front matter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code. By injecting malicious JavaScript into the front matter of a Markdown file, an attacker can execute commands on the server or within the environment where `md-to-pdf` is used.
- Unsafe default configuration: The JS engine was enabled by default within the gray-matter library, creating an opportunity for abuse.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete System Compromise:** An attacker could potentially gain full control of the system by executing arbitrary commands.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data could be accessed and exfiltrated from the server.
- **Denial of Service:** Malicious code could be used to disrupt the availability of the system.
- **Supply chain vulnerability:** Projects using `md-to-pdf` as a dependency are vulnerable if they process untrusted markdown content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Markdown Files:** The primary attack vector involves crafting malicious Markdown files with embedded JavaScript code in the front matter.
- **Untrusted Input:** Applications using `md-to-pdf` to process Markdown from untrusted sources (e.g., user-submitted content, external files) are vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to supply malicious markdown content:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a markdown file to be processed by `md-to-pdf`.
- **No Privileges Needed**: The attacker doesn't need any specific privileges on the system running `md-to-pdf`.
- **No User interaction:** The vulnerability can be triggered without any interaction of the user who runs `md-to-pdf` if malicious markdown content is parsed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by disabling the JavaScript engine by default in `md-to-pdf` version 5.0.0.
- The fix involves modifying the default options passed to `gray-matter` to disable the `js` engine.
- Users who require JavaScript execution in front matter can re-enable it by explicitly setting the `gray_matter_options` to `null` or `undefined`.

- A commit that introduced the fix in `md-to-pdf` which disables the js engine of gray-matter by default to prevent RCE.
- A discussion on a Github issue outlining the vulnerability and its implications, including a Proof of Concept exploit.
- A Snyk vulnerability report describing the vulnerability, its severity, and the fix, including CVSS scores, exploit maturity and a PoC.
