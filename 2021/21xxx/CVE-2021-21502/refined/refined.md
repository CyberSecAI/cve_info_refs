The provided content contains information about CVE-2021-21502.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the "use of SSH key past account expiration".

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The system allows the use of SSH keys for authentication even after the associated user account has expired.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with an expired account, but still possessing the ISI_PRIV_AUTH_SSH RBAC privilege, can gain access to the system with the same privileges they had before their account expiration. This could include access to high-privileged accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
A user on the network with the ISI_PRIV_AUTH_SSH RBAC privilege, and an expired account, can use their SSH key for continued access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must have an expired user account, the ISI_PRIV_AUTH_SSH RBAC privilege, and must have had an SSH key configured prior to their account expiration.

**Affected Products:**
Dell PowerScale OneFS versions 8.1.0, 8.1.1, 8.2.0, 8.2.1, 8.1.2, 8.2.2, 9.0.0, and 9.1.0

**Mitigations:**
1.  Remove authorized_keys files from homedir/.ssh of expired accounts.
2.  Remove expired accounts from roles that have ISI_AUTH_PRIV_SSH.
3.  Disable public key authentication in SSH.
