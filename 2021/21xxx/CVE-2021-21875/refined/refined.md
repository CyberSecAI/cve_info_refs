The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21875.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of user-supplied input within the `keypasswd` parameter when processing SSL credentials in Lantronix PremierWave 2050's web interface. This parameter is directly injected into `openssl` commands executed with root privileges without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- OS command injection (CWE-78) is present due to the lack of sanitization of the `keypasswd` parameter before it's used in `openssl` commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges on the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/ssl` endpoint of the web interface.
- The malicious command is included in the `keypasswd` parameter within the request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the web interface.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the device.
