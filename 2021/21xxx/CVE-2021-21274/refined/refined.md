{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the lack of a maximum size limit when fetching the .well-known file of a homeserver. This allows a malicious homeserver to redirect requests for the .well-known file to a large file, causing resource exhaustion on the requesting server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unbounded resource consumption when processing external data.",
      "Lack of input validation on the size of the .well-known file."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful attack can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) on vulnerable homeservers due to excessive resource consumption when processing a large .well-known file.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious homeserver redirects a .well-known lookup request to a large file."
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to control the content of a .well-known file served by a homeserver they control. The attacker does not need to be a user of the vulnerable homeserver.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability was fixed by adding a maximum size of 50 kilobytes to .well-known lookups. This prevents a malicious server from causing resource exhaustion by redirecting to a very large file. The fix was implemented in pull request #8950 and released in version 1.25.0."
