Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21419:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of highly compressed data and memory allocation with excessive size values when processing websocket frames in the `eventlet` library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Data Amplification:** The library doesn't properly limit the size of decompressed data, leading to potential data amplification where a small compressed payload expands to a much larger size in memory.
- **Unbounded Memory Allocation:** The library allocates memory based on the size of the incoming data without proper size checks, allowing an attacker to trigger excessive memory allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious peer can exploit this vulnerability by sending highly compressed websocket frames, causing the Eventlet process to exhaust its memory, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network through the websocket protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send websocket frames to a vulnerable Eventlet server. No specific user privileges or interaction is required.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of `eventlet` prior to 0.31.0 (specifically >= 0.10 and < 0.31.0).
- Version 0.31.0 includes a patch that restricts the websocket frame size to reasonable limits.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CWE-409 (Improper Handling of Compressed Data) and CWE-789 (Uncontrolled Memory Allocation).
- Mitigation also includes using OS limits to restrict memory usage, which can help prevent overall machine exhaustion.
