## Description

### Impact

[CVE-2021-3007](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xx8f-qf9f-5fgw "CVE-2021-3007"): Backport of Zend\_Http\_Response\_Stream, added certain type checking as a way to prevent exploitation. <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3007>

This vulnerability is caused by the unsecured deserialization of an object. In versions higher than Zend Framework 3.0.0, the attacker abuses the Zend3 feature that loads classes from objects in order to upload and execute malicious code in the server. The code can be uploaded using the “callback” parameter, which in this case inserts a malicious code instead of the “callbackOptions” array.
