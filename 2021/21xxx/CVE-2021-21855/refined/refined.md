Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-21855:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Integer overflow in the `sdp_box_read` function when handling the size of the "sdp " atom. The 64-bit size is truncated to 32 bits and used for allocation, while the original 64-bit size is used for reading data, leading to heap buffer overflows.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The 64-bit size of the "sdp " atom is cast to a 32-bit integer, and 1 is added to it before being used as the size for memory allocation using `gf_malloc`. If the original 64-bit size is close to the maximum value of a 32-bit integer (UINT_MAX), adding 1 will cause an overflow, resulting in a small or zero-sized buffer being allocated.
*   **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow:** After allocating the undersized buffer, the code proceeds to read data from the input into the buffer using the original, larger size. This results in writing data beyond the allocated buffer, causing a heap-based buffer overflow.
*   **Null-termination write out-of-bounds**: After the read, a null terminator is written at the specified length, which is also out of bounds.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** A heap-based buffer overflow occurs when data is written beyond the allocated buffer, leading to memory corruption.
*   **Code Execution:** The memory corruption could potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution by overwriting critical data structures.
*   **Denial of Service:** The overflow could lead to a crash, causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input:** An attacker can craft a malicious MPEG-4 file with a specially crafted "sdp " atom, triggering the integer overflow and buffer overflow during parsing.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker would need to convince a user to open the crafted file using a vulnerable application or library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to create a malicious file:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify an MPEG-4 file with a specific structure, including a "sdp " atom with a large size.
*   **User interaction:** The attacker requires the user to open the file with the vulnerable GPAC library.
*   **No special privileges**: The attacker does not require any special system privileges for the exploitation to occur.

**Additional Details:**

*   The `sdp_box_read` function reads the atom's 64-bit size, casts it to a 32-bit integer `length`, adds 1 to `length`, and then calls `gf_malloc` to allocate memory using the resulting (potentially overflowed) 32 bit size.  It then uses the original 32-bit `length` to copy data into the allocated buffer using `gf_bs_read_data`, thus causing a buffer overflow.
*   The vulnerability is triggered due to the unchecked size calculation and the mismatch between allocated buffer size and the size of data read into the buffer.
*   The Talos report indicates that the vulnerability exists within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC library.

This information provides more detail than the original CVE description by identifying the vulnerable function, the specific type of integer overflow, and the process leading to the heap-based buffer overflow.
