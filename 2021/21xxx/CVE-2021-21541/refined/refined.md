Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-21541:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. It arises from the iDRAC9 web interface not properly sanitizing user-supplied input that is reflected in the Document Object Model (DOM) of the web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- DOM-based XSS vulnerability. The web application directly uses user-controlled data in the DOM, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code that is then executed by the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim user's browser session when accessing the iDRAC9 web interface. This could potentially lead to:
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Modifying the content of the web page.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.
    - Other malicious activities depending on the functionality and privileges available within the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to trick a victim user into providing malicious HTML or JavaScript code to the DOM environment in the browser through the iDRAC9 web interface. This could involve crafting a malicious URL or utilizing other social engineering tactics.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the iDRAC9 system.
- The attacker needs to be able to get a user of the iDRAC9 web interface to interact with a crafted payload (e.g. by clicking on a specially crafted link) .

**Affected Versions:**
- Dell EMC iDRAC9 versions prior to 4.40.00.00 are vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to iDRAC9 version 4.40.00.00 or later.
