Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-21775:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a use-after-free in the way WebKit processes certain events related to `ImageLoader` objects. Specifically, the `dispatchPendingErrorEvent` function and how it handles `Image` objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Use-After-Free:**  The core issue is that a reference to an `ImageLoader` object becomes stale (dangling pointer) after the object has been freed. This stale reference is then accessed, leading to a crash or potential for further exploitation.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by an error event while loading an image, specifically when attempting to load an image from a non-existent path, combined with the dynamic creation of `HTMLImageElement` objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leak:**  The use-after-free can potentially lead to an information leak by reading from the freed memory which may contain sensitive data.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The memory corruption aspect can lead to crashes or, with controlled memory layout and heap grooming, potentially to arbitrary code execution. The provided crash log shows a heap-use-after-free error, confirming memory corruption.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, the advisory notes that memory corruption can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Page:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted web page containing malicious JavaScript and HTML that trigger the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim must be tricked into visiting this malicious webpage to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create a malicious web page:** An attacker needs to be able to create or control content on a web page.
*   **Social engineering or trickery:** The attacker must be able to convince a victim to visit the malicious page.

**Technical Details**

*   The vulnerability involves a sequence of events related to error handling of image loading. Specifically:
    1.  An error in a static HTMLImageElement triggers an event handler.
    2.  The event handler code executes until an exception is thrown due to `adoptNode`, triggering the event handler again.
    3.  This repeats (up to a counter limit), unwinding nested event handlers.
    4.  The unwinding executes `new ImageData(1024, 1024)` multiple times.
    5.  Finally, an `onload` handler executes, creating additional `ImageData` and `Image` objects.
    6.  This leads to the use-after-free, as the memory of the freed static image element is reallocated for a `new Image()`, and accessed when the error handler tries to process the event.
* The vulnerability is related to the `srcset` attribute of the image element which initially tries to load the image from a wrong path.
* The crash occurs in `WebCore::ImageLoader::dispatchPendingErrorEvent`.
*  The object reuse happens during the event handler execution.
* A backtrace of the crash log shows the freed memory being used.

**Affected Versions**

*   WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit versions before 2.32.3 are vulnerable. Specifically, the Talos report mentions testing with Webkit WebKitGTK 2.30.4.
*   Debian's stable distribution (buster) is vulnerable and is fixed in version 2.32.3-1~deb10u1
*   Fedora 33 and 34 are vulnerable and are fixed with webkit2gtk3-2.32.3-1.fc33 and webkit2gtk3-2.32.3-1.fc34 respectively.

**Mitigation**

*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by updating to WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit version 2.32.3 or later.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Marcin Towalski of Cisco Talos.
*   The Talos report includes a detailed crash log and a code snippet which shows where the crash occurs
*   The vulnerability is related to how HTMLImageElement are managed when a loading error occurs and how event handlers are triggered and unwound.
