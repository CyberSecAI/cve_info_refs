Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21639:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of type validation when processing data submitted to the `config.xml` REST API endpoint for a node in Jenkins. Specifically, the system doesn't verify the type of object being created after loading the data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Input Validation:** The core issue is the absence of proper type validation on data received via the `config.xml` REST API.
- **Type Confusion:** This allows an attacker to potentially replace a node with a different, unexpected type, leading to potential misconfiguration or other issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can replace an existing node with a node of a different type.
- This could lead to unexpected behavior, service disruptions, or even further exploitation, depending on the specific differences in node types and the capabilities of the new node type.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **REST API Endpoint:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `config.xml` REST API endpoint for a node.
- **Data Injection:** An attacker submits crafted data to this endpoint, designed to create an object of an unexpected type.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid credentials for the Jenkins instance.
- **Computer/Configure Permission:** Specifically, the attacker needs the "Computer/Configure" permission to access and manipulate node configurations.
