Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21510:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization of the "Host" header in the Dell iDRAC8 web interface. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary values into the Host header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Host Header Injection: The iDRAC8 software fails to validate or sanitize the Host header in HTTP requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Web-cache poisoning: By injecting a malicious 'Host' header, an attacker can potentially poison a web cache. This could lead to users being redirected to a malicious site or receiving compromised content.
- Triggering redirects: The injected 'Host' header can be used to trigger redirects to arbitrary URLs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to perform this attack, indicating this is a pre-authentication vulnerability.
- Network-based: This attack is carried out via network requests by injecting a modified Host header into the HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable iDRAC8 web interface.
- The attacker needs no prior access to the iDRAC interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected product is iDRAC8 versions prior to 2.75.100.75.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
- The vulnerability was reported by Ken Pyle from CYBIR.
- The fix is to update to iDRAC8 version 2.75.100.75 or later.
