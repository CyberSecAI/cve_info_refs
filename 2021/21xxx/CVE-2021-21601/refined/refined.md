- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Information Exposure in Log File vulnerability in CIS component of Dell EMC Data Protection Search and IDPA products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: User credentials being logged in a way that is accessible to a local attacker.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Disclosure of user credentials, which an attacker can potentially use to access the vulnerable application with the privileges of the compromised account.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the system is required for a low privileged attacker to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local, low-privileged access to the system.
