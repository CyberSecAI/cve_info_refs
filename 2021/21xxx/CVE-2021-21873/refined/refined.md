- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input within the `keypasswd` POST parameter, which is directly injected into `openssl` commands executed with root privileges.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is OS command injection (CWE-78). Specifically, the `keypasswd` parameter is directly incorporated into system calls without any validation or sanitization. This lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands within the context of the `openssl` command.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary command execution with root privileges on the target device, potentially leading to full system compromise.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is an authenticated HTTP POST request to the `/ssl` endpoint, with a crafted `keypasswd` parameter. The `keypasswd` parameter will be injected into three different `openssl` commands, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands in each case.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate to the PremierWave 2050's web interface to exploit this vulnerability.
