Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21384:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `shescape` library did not properly handle null characters in user-provided input when escaping arguments for shell commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input sanitization: The library failed to remove or escape null characters in the input.
- Shell injection vulnerability: By injecting null characters, attackers could bypass the intended escaping mechanism.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution: Attackers could inject null characters into the arguments, potentially executing arbitrary shell commands on the system.
- Bypassing shell injection defenses: The `shescape` library was designed to prevent shell injection, but this vulnerability allowed attackers to circumvent those protections.

**Attack vectors:**
- User-supplied input: Attackers could inject null characters into data that is later passed to `shescape` for escaping shell arguments.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to inject data: An attacker must be able to inject a payload containing null characters into an argument that will be processed by the vulnerable `shescape` library.
- Indirect exploitation: The attacker does not directly control the execution of the shell command but can manipulate the input to be executed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by stripping null characters from the input in version 1.1.3.
- The fix was implemented in both the Unix and Windows versions of the `escapeShellArg` function.
- A workaround for older versions involves manually stripping null characters using `arg.replace(/\u{0}/gu, "")`.
- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing.
- The severity was rated as High.
- The vulnerability impacts versions of `shescape` prior to 1.1.3.
