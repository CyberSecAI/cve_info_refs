{
  "CVE-2021-21473": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The function module `SRM_RFC_SUBMIT_REPORT` in function group `SRM_REP` does not enforce proper authorization checks for a dynamic program call, using a dynamically generated program name from untrusted sources in a `SUBMIT` call.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Missing authorization check",
      "Use of dynamically generated program name from untrusted sources"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute any existing ABAP report without holding sufficient authorizations.",
    "Attack vectors": "The function can be invoked remotely via the RFC protocol.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send RFC calls to the vulnerable function and have knowledge of existing ABAP reports."
