The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21140.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uninitialized Use in USB.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An uninitialized use vulnerability exists in the USB component of Chrome. This means a variable or memory location is used before it has been assigned a valid value, leading to undefined behavior.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact is not detailed, but uninitialized use vulnerabilities can lead to crashes, information leaks, or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the USB functionality within the browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path within the USB implementation. Specific capabilities are not detailed beyond that.
