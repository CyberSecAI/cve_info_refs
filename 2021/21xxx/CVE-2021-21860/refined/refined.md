Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2021-21860:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE-2021-21860:** Integer truncation vulnerability in the "trik" decoder of the GPAC library.

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a combination of integer truncation and a subsequent integer overflow when calculating the allocation size for a heap buffer. The 64-bit atom size is truncated to 32-bits and then multiplied by the size of `GF_TrickPlayBoxEntry`. This multiplication can cause an overflow and result in a smaller buffer than required.
*  **Weakness:** Integer truncation to a 32-bit value from a 64-bit value followed by an integer overflow during memory allocation calculation. This leads to a heap-based buffer overflow when writing data into the undersized buffer.
*   **Attack Vector:** A specially crafted MPEG-4 file containing a "trik" atom with a large size triggers the vulnerability. The file needs to be opened and parsed using the vulnerable GPAC library.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious crafted MPEG-4 file to a user to open with the vulnerable software. No special capabilities or position are mentioned beyond that.
*   **Impact:** A heap-based buffer overflow occurs, leading to memory corruption and potential code execution in the context of the application using the GPAC library.

**Technical Details:**

1.  **`trik_box_read` Function:** This function is responsible for parsing the "trik" atom.
2.  **Integer Truncation:** The 64-bit size of the atom is truncated to a 32-bit integer.
3.  **Overflow Calculation:** The truncated size is then multiplied by the size of `GF_TrickPlayBoxEntry` potentially leading to an integer overflow.
4.  **Undersized Allocation:** The result of the overflow is used to allocate memory which could lead to an allocation of an undersized buffer.
5.  **Heap Overflow:** The code proceeds to read data into the undersized buffer, causing a heap buffer overflow.

**Crash Information:**

*   The provided crash log demonstrates a heap-buffer-overflow detected by AddressSanitizer in the `trik_box_read` function.
*   The crash occurs due to writing past the allocated bounds of the heap buffer.

**Additional Information:**

*   The report includes a CVSSv3 score of 8.8, indicating a high severity vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is part of a series of related vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-21859, CVE-2021-21860, CVE-2021-21861, CVE-2021-21862) affecting the GPAC library's MPEG-4 decoding functionality.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by convincing a user to open a malicious crafted MPEG-4 file.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by the vendor on 2021-08-11
*   The Debian security advisory DSA-4966-1 confirms this vulnerability.
