Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21676:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `requests-plugin` for Jenkins does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint that is used for sending test emails.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Permission Check:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a permission check before allowing an attacker to send test emails. This means anyone with `Overall/Read` permission can access the email sending functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unintended Email Sending:** An attacker with `Overall/Read` permission can send test emails to an arbitrary email address they specify.
*   **Potential Phishing/Spoofing:** Although not explicitly stated, this could be used as a vector for social engineering attacks, potentially spoofing a legitimate source for phishing attempts if the email is crafted in a malicious manner.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Endpoint:** The vulnerability exists within an HTTP endpoint provided by the `requests-plugin`.
*   **Network Access:** The attack would likely be launched over the network, by making a request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Jenkins Account with Overall/Read Permission:** An attacker needs a Jenkins account that has at least the `Overall/Read` permission. This permission is relatively low privilege, suggesting a potentially wide range of users who could exploit this if they are malicious.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `requests-plugin` versions 2.2.7 and earlier.
*   The fix implemented in version 2.2.8 of the plugin requires `Overall/Administer` permission to send test emails, significantly restricting who can use this functionality.
*   This vulnerability is tracked as `SECURITY-2136 (2)` in Jenkins.
