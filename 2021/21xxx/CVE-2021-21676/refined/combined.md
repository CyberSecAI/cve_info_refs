* CAS Plugin 1.6.1
* requests-plugin 2.2.7, 2.2.8, and 2.2.13
* Selenium HTML report Plugin 1.1

Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and
attribution can be found here:
<https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2021-06-30/>

We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list:
<https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories>

If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as
described here:

SECURITY-2278 / CVE-2021-21670
Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier allows users to cancel
queue items and abort builds of jobs for which they have Item/Cancel
permission even when they do not have Item/Read permission.

SECURITY-2371 / CVE-2021-21671
Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier does not invalidate the
existing session on login. This allows attackers to use social engineering
techniques to gain administrator access to Jenkins.

This vulnerability was introduced in Jenkins 2.266 and LTS 2.277.1.

SECURITY-2329 / CVE-2021-21672
Selenium HTML report Plugin 1.0 and earlier does not configure its XML
parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers with the ability to control the report files parsed
using this plugin to have Jenkins parse a crafted report file that uses
external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or
server-side request forgery.

SECURITY-2387 / CVE-2021-21673
CAS Plugin 1.6.0 and earlier improperly determines that a redirect URL
after login is legitimately pointing to Jenkins.

This allows attackers to perform phishing attacks by having users go to a
Jenkins URL that will forward them to a different site after successful
authentication.

SECURITY-1995 / CVE-2021-21674
requests-plugin 2.2.6 and earlier does not perform a permission
check in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to view the list of
pending requests.

SECURITY-2136 (1) / CVE-2021-21675
requests-plugin 2.2.12 and earlier does not require POST requests to
request and apply changes, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities allow attackers to create requests and/or have
administrators apply pending requests, like renaming or deleting jobs,
deleting builds, etc.

SECURITY-2136 (2) / CVE-2021-21676
requests-plugin 2.2.7 and earlier does not perform a permission
check in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to send test emails to
an attacker-specified email address.

* [requests-plugin
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/requests)

## Descriptions

### Improper permission checks allow canceling queue items and aborting builds

**SECURITY-2278
/
CVE-2021-21670**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier allows users to cancel queue items and abort builds of jobs for which they have Item/Cancel permission even when they do not have Item/Read permission.

Jenkins 2.300, LTS 2.289.2 requires that users have Item/Read permission for applicable types in addition to Item/Cancel permission.

As a workaround on earlier versions of Jenkins, do not grant Item/Cancel permission to users who do not have Item/Read permission.

### Session fixation vulnerability

**SECURITY-2371
/
CVE-2021-21671**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Description:**

Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier does not invalidate the existing session on login.
This allows attackers to use social engineering techniques to gain administrator access to Jenkins.

This vulnerability was introduced in Jenkins 2.266 and LTS 2.277.1.

Jenkins 2.300, LTS 2.289.2 invalidates the existing session on login.

|  | In case of problems, administrators can choose a different implementation by setting the [Java system property `hudson.security.SecurityRealm.sessionFixationProtectionMode`](/doc/book/managing/system-properties/#hudson-security-securityrealm-sessionfixationprotectionmode) to `2`, or disable the fix entirely by setting that system property to `0`. |

### XXE vulnerability in Selenium HTML report Plugin

**SECURITY-2329
/
CVE-2021-21672**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`seleniumhtmlreport`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/seleniumhtmlreport)**

**Description:**

Selenium HTML report Plugin 1.0 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers with the ability to control the report files parsed using this plugin to have Jenkins parse a crafted report file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

Selenium HTML report Plugin 1.1 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

### Open redirect vulnerability in CAS Plugin

**SECURITY-2387
/
CVE-2021-21673**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`cas-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cas-plugin)**

**Description:**

CAS Plugin 1.6.0 and earlier improperly determines that a redirect URL after login is legitimately pointing to Jenkins.

This allows attackers to perform phishing attacks by having users go to a Jenkins URL that will forward them to a different site after successful authentication.

CAS Plugin 1.6.1 only redirects to relative (Jenkins) URLs.

### Missing permission check in requests-plugin Plugin allows viewing pending requests

**SECURITY-1995
/
CVE-2021-21674**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`requests`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/requests)**

**Description:**

requests-plugin Plugin 2.2.6 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to view the list of pending requests.

requests-plugin Plugin 2.2.7 requires Overall/Administer permission to view the list of pending requests.

|  | The previous sentence originally stated that Overall/Read permission was newly required. This statement was incorrect and has been fixed on 2021-07-05. |
| --- | --- |

### CSRF vulnerabilities in requests-plugin Plugin

**SECURITY-2136 (1)
/
CVE-2021-21675**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`requests`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/requests)**

**Description:**

requests-plugin Plugin 2.2.12 and earlier does not require POST requests to request and apply changes, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities allow attackers to create requests and/or have administrators apply pending requests, like renaming or deleting jobs, deleting builds, etc.

requests-plugin Plugin 2.2.13 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoints.

This was partially fixed in requests-plugin Plugin 2.2.8 to require POST requests for some of the affected HTTP endpoints, but the endpoint allowing administrators to apply pending requests remained unprotected until 2.2.13.

### Missing permission check in requests-plugin Plugin allows sending emails

**SECURITY-2136 (2)
/
CVE-2021-21676**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`requests`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/requests)**

**Description:**

requests-plugin Plugin 2.2.7 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to send test emails to an attacker-specified email address.

requests-plugin Plugin 2.2.8 requires Overall/Administer permission to send test emails.
