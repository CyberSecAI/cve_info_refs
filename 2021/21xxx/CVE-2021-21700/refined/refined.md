Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-21700:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Scriptler Plugin does not properly escape the names of scripts on the UI when prompting users to confirm their deletion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the Scriptler UI, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in the victim's browser session. This could enable the attacker to steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the victim, or redirect them to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Scriptler plugin UI. An attacker would need to create a script with a malicious name. When a user attempts to delete the malicious script through the user interface, the unescaped script name will be displayed, triggering the stored XSS vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create Scriptler scripts, indicating a user with sufficient permissions within the Jenkins environment.
