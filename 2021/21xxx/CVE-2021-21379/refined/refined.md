Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21379:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `{{wikimacrocontent}}` macro in XWiki executes its content with the rights of the macro's author instead of the user who called the macro. This means the macro's content runs with elevated privileges, often with programming rights.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Privilege Context:** The vulnerability stems from the macro using the author's security context, not the user who invoked the macro.
*   **Code Injection:** This incorrect context allows attackers to inject scripts or malicious code within the `{{wikimacrocontent}}` macro, which will then be executed with the elevated privileges of the macro author.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the rights of the macro author. This often includes programming rights, allowing them to modify the wiki or perform other administrative functions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Macro Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious code into the content of a wiki macro that uses `{{wikimacrocontent}}`. The vulnerability can be exploited via any macro using `{{wikimacrocontent}}`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Modify Macro Content:** The attacker needs the ability to inject content into a wiki macro that uses the vulnerable `{{wikimacrocontent}}` macro. This could mean being a user with edit rights to pages containing vulnerable macros.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Macros:** The attacker would need to be aware of macros using `{{wikimacrocontent}}` to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects XWiki versions `11.4-rc-1` to `11.10.10`, `12.0` to `12.6.2` and versions `12.7` and `12.7.1`.
*   Patched versions are `12.6.3`, `11.10.11` and `12.8-rc-1`.
*   The official description does not include that no such macro exists by default in XWiki standard, this is only included in the github content.
