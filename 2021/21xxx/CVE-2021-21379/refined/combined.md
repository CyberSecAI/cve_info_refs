# It's possible to execute anything with the rights of the author of a macro which uses the {{wikimacrocontent}} macro

High

[tmortagne](/tmortagne)
published
GHSA-v662-xpcc-9xf6
Mar 11, 2021

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-rendering-wikimacro-store
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

[11.4-rc-1, 11.10.10], [12.0, 12.6.2], 12.7, 12.7.1

## Patched versions

12.6.3, 11.10.11, 12.8-rc-1

## Description

### Impact

The `{{wikimacrocontent}}` executes the content with the rights of the wiki macro author instead of the caller of that wiki macro. This makes possible to inject scripts through it and they will be executed with the rights of the wiki macro (very often a user which has Programming rights).

Fortunately, no such macro exists by default in XWiki Standard but one could have been created or installed with an extension.

### Patches

It has been patched in versions XWiki 12.6.3, 11.10.11 and 12.8-rc-1.

### Workarounds

There is no easy workaround other than disabling the affected macros.

Inserting content in a safe way or knowing what is the user who called the wiki macro is not easy.

### References

<https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-17759>

#### Description

It means that anything you put in the content of the macro is executed with the right of the author of the macro (generally at least ADMIN and very often PROGRAMMING).

The problem is that WikiMacroContentMacro does not do anything to get the context of the executor of the macro and is executed as any other macro used for the implementation of the wiki macro itself.
