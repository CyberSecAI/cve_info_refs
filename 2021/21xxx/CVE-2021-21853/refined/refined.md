Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2021-21853:

**CVE-2021-21853**

*   **Root Cause:** Integer overflow in the "name" box decoder within the GPAC library.
*   **Weakness:** The `name_box_read` function truncates a 64-bit size to a 32-bit integer, adds 1, and then uses this potentially overflowed value for a memory allocation with `gf_malloc`. If the 64-bit size is close to the maximum 32-bit integer, adding 1 will cause an integer overflow, resulting in a very small or zero-sized allocation. Later, the function will use the original (truncated) size to read data into the undersized buffer, causing a heap overflow.
*   **Impact:** Heap-based buffer overflow, which can lead to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution under the context of the application using the vulnerable library.
*   **Attack Vector:** A specially crafted MPEG-4 file containing a "name" box with a large size.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker must be able to convince a user to open the malicious MPEG-4 file with software using the vulnerable GPAC library.

**CVE-2021-21854**

*   **Root Cause:** Integer overflow in the "rtp " box decoder within the GPAC library when the parent atom is "hnti".
*   **Weakness:** The `rtp_hnti_box_read` function truncates a 64-bit size to a 32-bit integer, adds 1, and then uses this potentially overflowed value for a memory allocation with `gf_malloc`. If the 64-bit size is close to the maximum 32-bit integer, adding 1 will cause an integer overflow, resulting in a very small or zero-sized allocation. Later, the function uses the original (truncated) size to read data into the undersized buffer, causing a heap overflow.
*   **Impact:** Heap-based buffer overflow, which can lead to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution under the context of the application using the vulnerable library.
*   **Attack Vector:** A specially crafted MPEG-4 file containing an "hnti" parent atom and an "rtp " box with a large size.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker must be able to convince a user to open the malicious MPEG-4 file with software using the vulnerable GPAC library.

**CVE-2021-21855**

*   **Root Cause:** Integer overflow in the "sdp " box decoder within the GPAC library.
*   **Weakness:** The `sdp_box_read` function truncates a 64-bit size to a 32-bit integer, adds 1, and then uses this potentially overflowed value for a memory allocation with `gf_malloc`. If the 64-bit size is close to the maximum 32-bit integer, adding 1 will cause an integer overflow, resulting in a very small or zero-sized allocation. Later, the function uses the original (truncated) size to read data into the undersized buffer, causing a heap overflow.
*   **Impact:** Heap-based buffer overflow, which can lead to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution under the context of the application using the vulnerable library.
*   **Attack Vector:** A specially crafted MPEG-4 file containing an "sdp " box with a large size.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker must be able to convince a user to open the malicious MPEG-4 file with software using the vulnerable GPAC library.

**CVE-2021-21856**

*   **Root Cause:** Integer overflow in the "svhd" box decoder within the GPAC library.
*   **Weakness:** The `svhd_box_read` function adds 1 to the size and then truncates to 32 bits before passing the value to `gf_malloc`. If a large size is set for the svhd box, adding 1 to the value will cause an integer overflow after the truncation and will lead to a small buffer being allocated. The function then reads the content of the box into the small buffer, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
*    **Impact:** Heap-based buffer overflow, which can lead to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution under the context of the application using the vulnerable library.
*   **Attack Vector:** A specially crafted MPEG-4 file containing a "svhd" box with a large size.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker must be able to convince a user to open the malicious MPEG-4 file with software using the vulnerable GPAC library.

**CVE-2021-21857**

*   **Root Cause:** Integer overflow in the "txtc" box decoder within the GPAC library.
*   **Weakness:** The `txtc_box_read` function adds 1 to the size before truncating to 32 bits before allocating memory. If the size is set to `UINT_MAX`, the addition can lead to an integer overflow and a zero-sized buffer allocation. The function then reads data into the undersized buffer using the original size, causing a heap overflow.
*   **Impact:** Heap-based buffer overflow, which can lead to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution under the context of the application using the vulnerable library.
*   **Attack Vector:** A specially crafted MPEG-4 file containing a "txtc" box with a large size.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker must be able to convince a user to open the malicious MPEG-4 file with software using the vulnerable GPAC library.

**CVE-2021-21858**

*   **Root Cause:** Integer truncation in the "url " box decoder within the GPAC library.
*   **Weakness:** The `url_box_read` function truncates a 64-bit atom size to 32 bits for allocation, but later uses the original 64-bit size when accessing this buffer, potentially resulting in an out-of-bounds read on 64-bit systems.
*   **Impact:** Heap-based buffer overflow, which can lead to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution under the context of the application using the vulnerable library.
*  **Attack Vector:** A specially crafted MPEG-4 file containing a "url " box with a large size.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker must be able to convince a user to open the malicious MPEG-4 file with software using the vulnerable GPAC library.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**

All of these vulnerabilities are a result of the GPAC library not properly handling large sizes of data when processing specially crafted MPEG-4 files. Integer overflows or truncations when calculating the memory needed for specific atoms during parsing is the common root cause for all of them. This leads to undersized memory allocations and heap-based buffer overflows when the library attempts to read or write the atom's data.

The vulnerabilities can be triggered by convincing a user to open a malicious MPEG-4 file with an application that uses the vulnerable GPAC library.
