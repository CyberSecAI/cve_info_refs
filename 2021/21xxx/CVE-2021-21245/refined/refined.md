Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21245:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `AttachmentUploadServlet` in OneDev, where user-controlled data from `request.getInputStream()` is directly saved to a location specified by the `request.getHeader("File-Name")`. This operation occurs before any authentication or authorization checks are performed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Pre-Auth Arbitrary File Upload:** The core vulnerability is the ability to upload files to arbitrary locations on the server without prior authentication. The file name and potentially the destination are derived from the user controlled `File-Name` header.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The original code did not sanitize the filename provided in the `File-Name` header, which allowed for path traversal and writing to unintended locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Attackers can upload malicious files (like webshells) to the server.
*   **WebShell Deployment:** By uploading a webshell, an attacker could gain remote code execution on the server, leading to complete compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to `AttachmentUploadServlet` with a malicious payload in the request body and a file name (including path traversal sequences like `../`) in the `File-Name` header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the OneDev server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** This vulnerability is pre-authentication, meaning the attacker does not need valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

The provided content also includes the fix for this vulnerability:
*   The `FilenameUtils.sanitizeFilename()` method is introduced to remove or replace characters that allow path traversal (`..`, `/`, `\`) in uploaded file names.
*   The changes are applied in the following java files: `InsertUrlPanel.java`, `MarkdownEditor.java`, `ProjectBlobPage.java`.

The commit message confirms the fix as "Fix the issue that uploaded file can be stored anywhere OneDev has write permissions over".
