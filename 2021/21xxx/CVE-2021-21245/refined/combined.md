# Pre-Auth Arbitrary File Upload

Critical

[robinshine](/robinshine)
published
GHSA-62m2-38q5-96w9
Jan 11, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<4.0.2

## Patched versions

4.0.3

## Description

### Impact

[`AttachmentUploadServlet`](https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/blob/main/server-core/src/main/java/io/onedev/server/web/component/markdown/AttachmentUploadServlet.java) also saves user controlled data (`request.getInputStream()`) to a user specified location (`request.getHeader("File-Name")`):

```
String fileName = URLDecoder.decode(request.getHeader("File-Name"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8.name());
...
String attachmentName = attachmentSuppport.saveAttachment(fileName, request.getInputStream());
```

This file system operation occurs before any authentication or authorization checks are enforced.

This issue may lead to `arbitrary file upload` which can be used to upload a [WebShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_shell) to OneDev server

### Patches

This issue is addressed in 4.0.3 by only allowing uploaded file to be in attachments folder. The webshell issue is not possible as OneDev never executes files in attachments folder.

### Credits

This issue was discovered by [@pwntester](https://github.com/pwntester)

### Severity

Critical

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-21245

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
