{
  "CVE-2021-21838": {
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow due to unchecked arithmetic in the 'fpar' FOURCC atom decoder.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Heap-based buffer overflow leading to memory corruption and potential code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious MPEG-4 file, an attacker can trigger the integer overflow in the 'fpar' decoder leading to memory corruption.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious MPEG-4 file using software that utilizes the vulnerable GPAC library."
