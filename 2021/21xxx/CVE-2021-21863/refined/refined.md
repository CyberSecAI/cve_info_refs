The provided document describes multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-21863.

**CVE-2021-21863:**

*   **Root Cause:** The CODESYS Development System V3 and CODESYS Installer deserialize local profile files without sufficiently verifying the data.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502)
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS), information disclosure, or remote code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Modifying local configuration and profile files of the CODESYS installation.
    *   Tricking a local user into opening a malicious CODESYS project or archive.
    *   Installing malicious packages using the CODESYS package manager, which can modify or add affected files.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to modify local files on the system running the affected software.
    *   Alternatively, the attacker needs to trick a local user into opening a malicious file.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   CODESYS Development System V3 versions prior to V3.5.17.10
*   CODESYS Installer versions prior to V1.3.0
