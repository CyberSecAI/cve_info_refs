Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-21349:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in XStream's deserialization process. XStream uses type information embedded within the processed input stream to recreate objects. An attacker can manipulate this input stream to inject malicious objects that trigger a server-side forgery request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary vulnerability is that an attacker can force the server to make requests to arbitrary URLs, potentially accessing internal resources.
*   **Unsafe Deserialization:** XStream, by default (prior to 1.4.16), used a blacklist approach for security, which proved to be inadequate. It failed to prevent the injection of malicious objects. The core problem stems from XStream blindly trusting type information present in the serialized data.
*   **Type Manipulation:** The ability to manipulate the input stream's type information allows an attacker to construct objects that can perform malicious activities upon deserialization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker can potentially request data from internal resources that are not publicly accessible, leading to information disclosure.
*   **Intranet Scanning:** The vulnerability can be used to probe internal networks for vulnerable services.
*   **Resource Access:** Attackers can leverage XStream to access data from arbitrary URLs within the intranet or the local host.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated Input Stream:** The attack vector is the manipulated input stream during the unmarshalling process of XStream. The attacker alters this stream to include malicious objects and type information.
*   **Arbitrary Format:** The attack can be performed using any supported format of XStream, including XML and JSON, as the vulnerability lies in the deserialization mechanism itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Manipulate Input Stream:** The attacker needs to be able to control the input stream that XStream is processing.
*   **Remote Access (Typically):** The attacker is typically remote from the system executing XStream, leveraging the manipulated input stream as the attack vector to trigger the SSRF.
*   **No User Interaction:** Exploitation can occur without any user interaction except for providing the malicious input to XStream.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in all XStream versions up to and including 1.4.15.
*   The recommended mitigation is to use XStream's security framework by implementing a whitelist of allowed types.
*   The provided example XML payload demonstrates a sequence of nested classes and references used to create a malicious data stream, that is processed by XStream at unmarshalling time.
*   XStream 1.4.18 changes the default behaviour of XStream to use a whitelist of allowed types for deserialization.
*   Older versions of XStream (prior to 1.4.16) used a blacklist by default which was not sufficient to mitigate this type of vulnerability.
*   A fix for the vulnerability is included in XStream version 1.4.16 by setting up a whitelist, effectively blocking all classes except those with explicit converters, which requires explicit action by the user to define required converters..
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by threedr3am.
