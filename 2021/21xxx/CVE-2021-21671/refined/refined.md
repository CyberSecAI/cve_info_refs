Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-21671:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Jenkins application does not invalidate the existing session upon user login.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Session fixation vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can potentially gain administrator access to Jenkins through social engineering.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Social engineering techniques are used to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into logging into Jenkins while the attacker has a valid session.
- It is implied that the attacker has somehow obtained a valid session of an existing user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to induce a user, especially an administrator to reuse their existing session. This implies that the attacker needs to have access to the victim's session and find a way to reuse the session. This may involve a separate attack vector.
- No specific network access is defined, but it must be assumed the attacker needs to have access to the Jenkins system.

**Technical Details:**
- Jenkins versions 2.299 and earlier, and LTS versions 2.289.1 and earlier are affected.
- The vulnerability was introduced in Jenkins 2.266 and LTS 2.277.1.
- The fix is implemented in Jenkins 2.300 and LTS 2.289.2, which invalidate the existing session on login.
- Administrators have the option to choose a different implementation or disable the fix by modifying the `hudson.security.SecurityRealm.sessionFixationProtectionMode` Java system property.
