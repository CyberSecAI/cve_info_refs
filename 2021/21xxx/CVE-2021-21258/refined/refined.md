Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21258:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) injection issue present in the `ajax/kanban.php` file of the GLPI project.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XSS Injection:** The code was vulnerable to XSS injection, likely due to insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input that gets reflected in the output of the `ajax/kanban.php` page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **XSS Injection:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the webpage viewed by users. This could lead to various consequences, such as:
    -  Session hijacking
    -  Credential theft
    -  Malware distribution
    -  Defacement of the application

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `ajax/kanban.php` endpoint.
- The attacker likely injects the malicious payload through a parameter in a request to `ajax/kanban.php`. This is inferred from the patch that introduces `Toolbox::clean_cross_side_scripting_deep($_REQUEST);` to sanitize the request parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the affected `ajax/kanban.php` endpoint.
- They also need the ability to craft a malicious payload that will be executed by the victim's browser.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in GLPI versions 9.5.0 and later.
- It was patched in version 9.5.4.
- The commit `e7802fc051696de1f76108ea8dc3bd4e2c880f15` introduced a fix by sanitizing the `$_REQUEST` parameters with `Toolbox::clean_cross_side_scripting_deep()`.
- The description of the vulnerability in the first content states "XSS injection using ajax/kanban.php".
- The second content contains the commit message: "Prevent XSS on Kanban" and also shows the code changes associated with that fix which includes the sanitization function.

This information is more detailed than the placeholder description provided in the CVE.
