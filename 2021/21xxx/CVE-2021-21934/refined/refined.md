```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to misuse of prepared statements in the context of the application, along with stored procedures combined with SQL concatenation. Input sanitization is circumvented as the sanitized variables are used to construct an SQL query, losing their protection when invoked against the database due to a lack of specific parameter bindings when the final query is prepared.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via crafted HTTP GET requests to the ‘device_list’ page. Specifically, by manipulating the ‘imei_filter’ parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated as a user of the application. This can be achieved via any valid user account or through a cross-site request forgery attack."
