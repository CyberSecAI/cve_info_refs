Applications that are using node-etsy-client and reporting client error to the end user will offer api key value too

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

[#18](https://github.com/creharmony/node-etsy-client/pull/18) fixes this issue. This is fixed in [node-etsy-client v0.3.0](https://github.com/creharmony/node-etsy-client/tree/v0.3.0) and later.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H
