```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The TCP data offset field in an incoming packet is not validated against the actual packet length. This unvalidated offset is then used in a calculation to determine the packet length, which can lead to an integer overflow and out-of-bounds memory access.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Integer overflow",
    "Out-of-bounds read"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a crash by sending a specially crafted TCP packet with an invalid data offset. This leads to out-of-bounds memory access.",
  "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can send a crafted TCP packet to a vulnerable system.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a TCP connection with a system running a vulnerable version of Contiki-NG. The attacker can then send malicious TCP packets."
