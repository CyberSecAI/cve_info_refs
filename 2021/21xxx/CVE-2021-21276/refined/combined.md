# Privilege escalation vulnerability in setup process

Critical

[cydrobolt](/cydrobolt)
published
GHSA-vg6w-8w9v-xxqc
Jan 28, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<2.3.0

## Patched versions

2.3.0

## Description

### Impact

A vulnerability in the setup process allows attackers to gain admin access to site instances, even if they do not possess an existing account. This vulnerability exists regardless of users' settings.

### Description

If an attacker crafts a request with specific cookie headers to the `/setup/finish` endpoint, they may be able to obtain admin privileges on the instance. This is caused by a loose comparison (`==`) in `SetupController` that is susceptible to attack. The project has been patched to ensure that a strict comparison (`===`) is used to verify the setup key, and that `/setup/finish` verifies that no `users` table exists before performing any migrations or provisioning any new accounts.

### Patches

Upgrade to the latest commit in `master` or upgrade to 2.3.0.

### Workarounds

Users can patch this vulnerability without upgrading by adding `abort(404)` to the very first line of `finishSetup` in `SetupController.php`

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [Polr](https://github.com/cydrobolt/polr)

### Severity

Critical

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-21276

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
