Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21411:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content from GitHub ([https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-652x-m2gr-hppm](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-652x-m2gr-hppm)) directly relates to the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-21411. This advisory is about a bug in `oauth2-proxy` versions 7.0.0 and 7.0.1, where GitLab group authorization was not working as expected. The other content snippets are supporting material from the `oauth2-proxy` repository.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

   *   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability was caused by a bug introduced during the implementation of GitLab project-based authorization. The session's group field was incorrectly populated with the groups configured using the `--gitlab-group` option instead of fetching the actual user's group membership from the GitLab Userinfo endpoint.
   *   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
        *   Incorrect authorization logic: The code did not correctly compare the user's actual group memberships with the required groups for authorization.
        *   Improper session population:  The session data was populated with configured groups instead of user groups, causing an authorization bypass
   *   **Impact of Exploitation:**
       *   Authorization Bypass: Any authenticated user, regardless of their group membership in GitLab, could access applications protected by `oauth2-proxy`.
       *   Incorrect Group Information: The `X-Forwarded-Groups` header would include groups defined in the configuration, rather than the user's actual groups.
   *   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker who has a valid user in the targeted GitLab environment could bypass authorization rules.
   *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to:
        *  Have a valid user account in the target GitLab environment
        *  Be able to send requests to the application protected by the vulnerable `oauth2-proxy` instance.
        * No special privileges are required beyond valid user credentials.

**3. Additional Information from the Content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** `oauth2-proxy` versions 7.0.0 and 7.0.1 are affected.
*   **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 7.1.0.
*   **Workaround:** There is no workaround for the group membership authorization bug. The advisory suggests using project-based authorization (`--gitlab-project`) as a temporary workaround since it wasn't affected.
*   **CVSS Score:** A CVSS v3 score of 5.5 is given which is moderate severity.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrading `oauth2-proxy` to version 7.1.0 is the recommended solution.

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-21411 describes an authorization bypass vulnerability in the GitLab provider of `oauth2-proxy` versions 7.0.0 and 7.0.1. Due to a bug in the way group memberships were handled, any authenticated GitLab user could bypass the group based authorization restrictions and access protected resources. The issue is resolved in version 7.1.0. The attacker needs only a valid account on the targeted gitlab instance.
