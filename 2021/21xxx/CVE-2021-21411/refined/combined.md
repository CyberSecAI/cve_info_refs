![OAuth2 Proxy](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/raw/v7.8.0/docs/static/img/logos/OAuth2_Proxy_horizontal.svg)

OAuth2-Proxy is a flexible, open-source tool that can act as either a standalone reverse proxy or a middleware component integrated into existing reverse proxy or load balancer setups. It provides a simple and secure way to protect your web applications with OAuth2 / OIDC authentication. As a reverse proxy, it intercepts requests to your application and redirects users to an OAuth2 provider for authentication. As a middleware, it can be seamlessly integrated into your existing infrastructure to handle authentication for multiple applications.

OAuth2-Proxy supports a lot of OAuth2 as well as OIDC providers. Either through a generic OIDC client or a specific implementation for Google, Microsoft Entra ID, GitHub, login.gov and others. Through specialised provider implementations oauth2-proxy can extract more details about the user like preferred usernames and groups. Those details can then be forwarded as HTTP headers to your upstream applications.

![Simplified Architecture](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/raw/v7.8.0/docs/static/img/simplified-architecture.svg)

### Get Started

OAuth2-Proxy's [Installation Docs](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/installation) cover how to install and configure your setup. Additionally you can take a further look at the [example setup files](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/tree/master/contrib/local-environment).

### Releases

#### Binaries

We publish oauth2-proxy as compiled binaries on GitHub for all major architectures as well as more exotic ones like `ppc64le` as well as `s390x`.

Check out the [latest release](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/releases/latest).

#### Images

From `v7.6.0` and up the base image has been changed from Alpine to [GoogleContainerTools/distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless).
This image comes with even fewer installed dependencies and thus should improve security. The image therefore is also slightly smaller than Alpine.
For debugging purposes (and those who really need it. e.g. `armv6`) we still provide images based on Alpine. The tags of these images are suffixed with `-alpine`.

Since 2023-11-18 we build nightly images directly from the `master` branch and provide them at `quay.io/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy-nightly`.
These images are considered unstable and therefore should **NOT** be used for production purposes unless you know what you're doing.

### Sponsors

# Groups

**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

In GitLab, you use groups to manage one or more related projects at the same time.

You can use groups to communicate with all group members and manage permissions for your projects.
If someone has access to the group, they get access to all the projects in the group.

You can also view all of the issues and merge requests for the projects in the group,
and analytics about the groupâs activity.

For larger organizations, you can also create [subgroups](subgroups/index.html).

For more information about creating and managing your groups, see [Manage groups](manage.html).
## Group hierarchy

Groups are organized in a tree structure:

* A **top-level group** is a group created at the ârootâ of the organization. An organization can have one or more top-level groups. A top-level group can contain one or more subgroups.* A **parent group** is a group that contains one or more subgroups.* A **subgroup** is a group that is part of another group.

For example, in the following diagram:

* The organization has four groups: one top-level group (T), which contains one subgroup (G), and two subgroups within G (A and B).* T is a top-level group and the parent group of G.* G is a subgroup (child) of T and the parent group of A and B.* A and B are subgroups (children) of G.

accTitle: Group hierarchy
accDescr: Example of a group hierarchy in an organization
subgraph Organization
T[Group T] --> G[Group G]
G --> A[Group A]
G --> B[Group B]
end
## Group structure

The way to set up a group depends on your use cases, team size, and access requirements.
The following table describes the most common models of structuring groups.

| Model Structure Use cases| Simple One group for all your projects. Work in a small team or on specific solutions (for example, a marketing website) that require seamless collaboration and access to resources.| Team Different groups or subgroups for different types of teams (for example, product and engineering). Work in a large organization where some teams work autonomously or require centralized resources and limited access from external team members.| Client One group for each client. Provide custom solutions for multiple clients that require different resources and access levels.| Functionality One group or subgroup for one type of functionality (for example, AI/ML). Develop complex products where one functionality requires specific resources and collaboration of subject-matter experts. | | | | | | | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

noteOn GitLab Self-Managed, if you want to see an overview of your entire organization, you should create one top-level group.
For more information about efforts to create an organization view of all groups,
[see epic 9266](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9266).
A top-level group offers insights in your entire organization through a complete
[Security Dashboard and Center](../application_security/security_dashboard/index.html),
[Vulnerability Report](../application_security/vulnerability_report/index.html#vulnerability-report),
[compliance center](../compliance/compliance_center/index.html), and
[value stream analytics](../group/value_stream_analytics/index.html).
## Group visibility

Like projects, a group can be configured to be visible to:

* Anonymous users.* All authenticated users.* Only explicit group members.

The restriction for [visibility levels](../../administration/settings/visibility_and_access_controls.html#restrict-visibility-levels)
on the application setting level also applies to groups. If set to internal, the explore page is
empty for anonymous users. The group page has a visibility level icon.

Users cannot create a subgroup or project with a higher visibility level than that of
the immediate parent group.
## View groups

To explore all public groups you are a member of:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to**.- Select **View all my groups**.- In the upper right, select **Explore groups**.

To view groups where you have direct or indirect membership:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to**.- Select **View all my groups**.

This page shows groups that you are a member of through:

* Membership of a subgroupâs parent group.* Direct or inherited membership of a project in the group or subgroup.

## View a group

The group overview page displays information about the group and its members, subgroups, and projects, such as:

* Group description* Recent activity* Number of merge requests and issues created* Number of members added* Subgroups and projects* Shared projects* Archived projects

To view a group:

* On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.

You can search for the subgroups and projects of the group
and sort them in ascending or descending order.
## View group activity

To view the activity of a group:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.- Select **Manage > Activity**.- Optional. To filter activity by contribution type, select a tab:
       * **All**: All contributions by group members in the group and groupâs projects.* **Push events**: Push events in the groupâs projects.* **Merge events**: Accepted merge requests in the groupâs projects.* **Issue events**: Issues opened and closed in the groupâs projects.* **Comments**: Comments posted by group members in the groupâs projects.* **Wiki**: Updates to wiki pages in the group.* **Designs**: Designs added, updated, and removed in the groupâs projects.* **Team**: Group members who joined and left the groupâs projects.

### Access a group by using the group ID

**History**

* [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/165889) in GitLab 17.5.

You can access a group by using its ID instead of its name at `https://gitlab.example.com/-/g/<id>`.
For example, if your group `example-group` has an ID `123456`, you can access the group either at
`https://gitlab.example.com/example-group` or `https://gitlab.example.com/-/g/123456`.

You might need the group ID if you want to interact with it using the [GitLab API](../../api/index.html).

To copy the Group ID:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your Group.- On the Group overview page, in the upper-right corner, select **Actions** ().- Select **Copy Group ID**.

## Create a group

To create a group:

1. On the left sidebar, at the top, select **Create new** () and **New group**.- Select **Create group**.- In the **Group name** text box, enter the name of the group. For a list of words that cannot be used as group names, see
       [reserved names](../reserved_names.html).- In the **Group URL** text box, enter the path for the group used for the [namespace](../namespace/index.html).- Select the [**Visibility level**](../public_access.html) of the group.- Optional. To personalize your GitLab experience:
             * For **Who will be using this group?**, select an option.* From the **What will you use this group for?** dropdown list, select an option.- Optional. To invite members to the group, in the **Email 1** text box, enter the email address of the user you want to invite. To invite more users, select **Invite another member** and enter the userâs email address.- Select **Create group**.

For details about groups, watch [GitLab Namespaces (users, groups and subgroups)](https://youtu.be/r0sJgjR2f5A).
## Edit group name, description, and avatar

You can edit your group details from the group general settings.

Prerequisites:

* You must have the Owner role for the group.

To edit group details:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.- Select **Settings > General**.- In the **Group name** text box, enter your group name. See the [limitations on group names](../../user/reserved_names.html).- Optional. In the **Group description (optional)** text box, enter your group description.
         The description is limited to 500 characters.- Optional. Under **Group avatar**, select **Choose file**, then select an image. The ideal image size is 192 x 192 pixels, and the maximum file size allowed is 200 KB.- Select **Save changes**.

## Leave a group

**History**

* The button to leave a group [moved](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/431539) to the Actions menu in GitLab 16.7.

When you leave a group:

* You are no longer a member of the group, its subgroups, and projects, and cannot contribute.* All the issues and merge requests that were assigned to you are unassigned.

To leave a group:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.- On the group overview page, in the upper-right corner, select **Actions** (**{ellipsis\_v})**.- Select **Leave group**, then **Leave group** again.

## Delete a group

**History**

* Enabled delayed deletion by default and removed the option to delete immediately [on GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/393622) and [on self-managed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/119606) in GitLab 16.0.

To delete a group and its contents:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.- Select **Settings > General**.- Expand the **Advanced** section.- In the **Delete group** section, select **Delete group**.- On the confirmation dialog, type the group name and select **Confirm**.

You can also delete a group from the groups dashboard:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to**.- Select **View all my groups**.- Select () for the group you want to delete.- Select **Delete**.- In the **Delete group** section, select **Delete group**.- On the confirmation dialog, type the group name and select **Confirm**.

On GitLab [Premium](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/premium/) and [Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/ultimate/), this action adds a background job to mark a group for deletion. By default, the job schedules the deletion seven days in the future. You can modify this retention period through the [instance settings](../../administration/settings/visibility_and_access_controls.html#deletion-protection).

If the user who scheduled the group deletion loses access to the group (for example, by leaving the group, having their role downgraded, or being banned from the group) before the deletion occurs,
the deletion job will instead restore and unarchive the group, so the group will no longer be scheduled for deletion.
caution If the user who scheduled the group deletion regains Owner role or administrator access before the job runs, then the job removes the group permanently.
### View groups pending deletion

**Tier:** Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

To view a list of the subgroups that are pending deletion in a group:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.- Select **Subgroups and projects**.

Groups that are marked for deletion are labeled **Pending deletion**.
## Delete a group immediately

**Tier:** Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated
**History**

* Enabled delayed deletion by default and removed the option to delete immediately [on GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/393622) and [on self-managed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/119606) in GitLab 16.0.

If you donât want to wait, you can delete a group immediately.

Prerequisites:

* You must have the Owner role for a group.* You have [marked the group for deletion](#delete-a-group).

To immediately delete a group marked for deletion:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.- Select **Settings > General**.- Expand **Advanced**.- In the **Permanently delete group** section, select **Delete group**.- Confirm the action when asked to.

This action deletes the group, its subgroups, projects, and all related resources, including issues and merge requests.
## Restore a group

**Tier:** Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

To restore a group that is marked for deletion:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.- Select **Settings > General**.- Expand the **Advanced** section.- In the **Restore group** section, select **Restore group**.

## Request access to a group

As a user, you can request to be a member of a group, if an administrator allows it.

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to**.- Select **View all my groups**.- In the upper right, select **Explore groups**.- In the **Search by name** text box, enter the name of the group you want to join.- In the search results, select the name of the group.- On the group page, under the group name, select **Request Access**.

Up to ten of the most recently active group owners receive an email with your request.
Any group owner can approve or decline the request.

If you change your mind before your request is approved, select
**Withdraw Access Request**.
## View group members

To view members of a group:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.- Select **Manage > Members**.

A table displays the memberâs:

* **Account** name and username.* **Source** of their [membership](../project/members/index.html#membership-types).
    For transparency, GitLab displays all membership sources of group members.
    Members who have multiple membership sources are displayed and counted as separate members.
    For example, if a member has been added to the group both directly and through inheritance,
    the member is displayed twice in the **Members** table, with different sources,
    and is counted as two individual members of the group.* [**Role**](../project/members/index.html#which-roles-you-can-assign) in the group.* **Expiration** date of their group membership.* **Activity** related to their account.

noteThe display of group membersâ **Source** might be inconsistent.
For more information, see [issue 23020](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/23020).

To view all namespace members (and their respective occupied seats), in the top-level namespace, [view the **Usage Quotas** page](../../subscriptions/gitlab_com/index.html#view-seat-usage).
## Filter and sort members in a group

To find members in a group, you can sort, filter, or search.
### Filter a group

Filter a group to find members. By default, all members in the group and subgroups are displayed.

In lists of group members, entries can display the following badges:

* **SAML**, to indicate the member has a [SAML account](saml_sso/index.html) connected to them.* **Enterprise**, to indicate that the member of the top-level group is an [enterprise user](../enterprise_user/index.html).

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.- Select **Manage > Members**.- Above the list of members, in the **Filter members** text box, enter your search criteria. To view:
       * Direct members of the group, select **Membership = Direct**.* Inherited, shared, and inherited shared members of the group, select **Membership = Indirect**.* Members with two-factor authentication enabled or disabled, select **2FA = Enabled** or **2FA = Disabled**.* Members of the top-level group who are [enterprise users](../enterprise_user/index.html), select **Enterprise = true**.

### Search a group

You can search for members by name, username, or [public email](../profile/index.html#set-your-public-email).

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.- Select **Manage > Members**.- Above the list of members, in the **Filter members** box, enter search criteria.- To the right of the **Filter members** box, select the magnifying glass ().

### Sort members in a group

You can sort members by **Account**, **Access granted**, **Role**, or **Last sign-in**.

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.- Select **Manage > Members**.- Above the list of members, in the upper-right corner, from the **Account** list, select
       the criteria to filter by.- To switch the sort between ascending and descending, to the right of the **Account** list, select the
         arrow ( or ).

## Add users to a group

**History**

* Expiring access email notification [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/12704) in GitLab 16.2.* Access expiration date for direct members of subgroups and projects [removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/471051) in GitLab 17.4.

You can give a user access to all projects in a group.

Prerequisites:

* You must have the Owner role for the group.* If [sign-up is disabled](../../administration/settings/sign_up_restrictions.html#disable-new-sign-ups), an administrator must add the user by email first.* If [administrator for role promotions](../../administration/settings/sign_up_restrictions.html#turn-on-administrator-approval-for-role-promotions) is turned on, an administrator must approve the invite.

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.- Select **Manage > Members**.- Select **Invite members**.- If the user:
         * Has a GitLab account, enter the userâs username.* Doesnât have a GitLab account, enter the userâs email address.- Select a [default role](../permissions.html) or [custom role](../custom_roles.html).- Optional. For **Access expiration date**, enter or select a date.
             From that date onward, the user can no longer access the project.

             If you enter an access expiration date, the group member gets an email notification
             seven days before their access expires.
             cautionMaintainers have full permissions until their role expires, including the ability to
             extend their own access expiration date.
             - Select **Invite**.
               If you invite the user by their:
               * GitLab username, the user is added to the member list.* Email address, the user receives an email invitation and is prompted to create an account.
                   If the invitation is not accepted, GitLab sends reminder emails two, five, and ten days later.
                   Unaccepted invites are automatically deleted after 90 days.

Members that are not automatically added are displayed on the **Invited** tab.
This tab includes users who:

* Have not yet accepted the invitation.* Are waiting for [approval from an administrator](../../administration/moderate_users.html).* [Exceed the group user cap](manage.html#user-cap-for-groups).

### View users pending promotion

If [administrator approval for role promotions](../../administration/settings/sign_up_restrictions.html#turn-on-administrator-approval-for-role-promotions) is turned on, membership requests that promote existing users into a billable role require administrator approval.

To view users pending promotion:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.- Select **Manage > Members**.- Select the **Role promotions** tab.

If the **Role promotions** tab is not displayed, the group has no pending promotions.
## Remove a member from the group

Prerequisites:

* You must have the Owner role.* The member must have direct membership in the group. If
    membership is inherited from a parent group, then the member can be removed
    from the parent group only.

To remove a member from a group:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.- Select **Manage > Members**.- Next to the member you want to remove, select the vertical ellipsis ().- Select **Remove member**.- Optional. On the **Remove member** confirmation dialog, select one or both checkboxes:
           * **Also remove direct user membership from subgroups and projects*** **Also unassign this user from linked issues and merge requests**- Select **Remove member**.

GitLab administrators can also [ensure removed users cannot invite themselves back](../project/members/index.html#ensure-removed-users-cannot-invite-themselves-back).
## Add projects to a group

You can add a new project to a group in two ways:

* Select a group, and then select **New project**. You can then continue [creating your project](../../user/project/index.html).* While you are creating a project, select a group from the dropdown list.

    [![Select group](img/select_group_dropdown_v13_10.png)](img/select_group_dropdown_v13_10.png)

### Specify who can add projects to a group

By default, users with at least the:

* Developer role can create projects under a group. This default can be changed.* Maintainer role can fork projects into a group. This default prevents users with the Developer role from forking projects that
    contain protected branches and cannot be changed.

To change the role that can create projects under a group:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.- Select **Settings > General**.- Expand the **Permissions and group features** section.- From **Roles allowed to create projects**, select an option.- Select **Save changes**.

To change this setting globally, see [Default project creation protection](../../administration/settings/visibility_and_access_controls.html#define-which-roles-can-create-projects).

## Release Highlights

* New improved design for sign in and error pages based on bulma framework
* Refactored templates loading
  + `robots.txt`, `sign_in.html` and `error.html` can now be provided individually in `--custom-templates-dir`
  + If any of the above are not provided, defaults are used
  + Defaults templates be found in [pkg/app/pagewriter](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/tree/v7.1.0/pkg/app/pagewriter)
* Introduction of basic prometheus metrics
* Introduction of Traefik based local testing/example environment
* Support for request IDs to allow request co-ordination of log lines

## Important Notes

* [GHSA-652x-m2gr-hppm](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-652x-m2gr-hppm) GitLab group authorization stopped working in v7.0.0, the functionality has now been restored, please see the linked advisory for details
* [#1103](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/1103) Upstream request signatures via `--signature-key` is

  deprecated. Support will be removed completely in v8.0.0.
* [1087](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/1087) The default logging templates have been updated to include {{.RequestID}}
* [#1117](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/1117) The `--gcp-healthchecks` option is now deprecated. It will be removed in a future release.
  + To migrate, you can change your application health checks for OAuth2 Proxy to point to

    the `--ping-path` value.
  + You can also migrate the user agent based health check using the `--ping-user-agent` option. Set it to `GoogleHC/1.0` to allow health checks on the path `/` from the Google health checker.

# `--gitlab-group` GitLab Group Authorization config flag stopped working in v7.0.0

Moderate

[JoelSpeed](/JoelSpeed)
published
GHSA-652x-m2gr-hppm
Mar 25, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

7.0.0, 7.0.1

## Patched versions

7.1.0

## Description

The `--gitlab-group` flag for group-based authorization in the GitLab provider stopped working in the v7.0.0 release.

Regardless of the flag settings, authorization wasn't restricted. Additionally, any authenticated users had whichever groups were set in `--gitlab-group` added to the new `X-Forwarded-Groups` header to the upstream application.

While adding GitLab project based authorization support in [#630](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/pull/630), a bug was introduced where the user session's groups field was populated with the `--gitlab-group` config entries instead of pulling the individual user's group membership from the GitLab Userinfo endpoint. When the session groups where compared against the allowed groups for authorization, they matched improperly (since both lists were populated with the same data) so authorization was allowed.

### Impact

This impacts GitLab Provider users who relies on group membership for authorization restrictions. Any authenticated users in your GitLab environment can access your applications regardless of `--gitlab-group` membership restrictions.

### Patches

This is patched in v7.1.0

### Workarounds

There is no workaround for the Group membership bug. But `--gitlab-project` can be set to use Project membership as the authorization checks instead of groups; it is not broken.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
