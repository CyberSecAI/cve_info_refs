## The Systeminformation Project

This is amazing. Started as a small project just for myself, it now has > 17,000
lines of code, > 650 versions published, up to 8 mio downloads per month, > 330
mio downloads overall. #1 NPM ranking for backend packages. Thank you to all who
contributed to this project!

> **Upcoming Version 6**
>
> With a lot of new features, improvements and a cleaned up API where will also
> be some breaking changes. We will release the first beta soon.

## Please support this project ... âï¸

Over the past few years I spent **more than 3.000 hours** working on this
project and invested in hardware to be able to test on different platforms.
Currently I am working very hard on the next **new version 6.0** completely
rewritten in TypeScript and with a lot of new features. Any support is highly
appreciated - [Buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/systeminfo).

**Your contribution** make it possible for me to keep working on this project,
add new features and support more platforms. Thank you in advance!

## Node.js â, Bun â and Deno â

I tested this library with Node.js, Bun and Deno (V2.x) with no issues. There
was only one problem on Denos side in version <= 2.1.4: os.freemem() pollyfill
was not correct but this is now fixed with Deno >= 2.1.5.

**Attention**: This library is supposed to be used as a backend/server-side
library and **will definitely not work within a browser**.

## New Version 5.0

The new Version 5 is here - this next major version release 5.0 comes with new
functionality and several improvements and changes (some of them are breaking
changes!):

* added audio: get detailed audio device information
* added bluetooth: get detailed bluetooth device information
* added dockerImages, dockerVolumes: get detailed information about docker
  images and volumes
* added printer: get information from detected printers
* added usb: get detailed usb controller and device information
* added wifi interfaces and connections: extended wifi information
* better uuid function to get unique hardware and OS UUIDs
* better/extended cpu info detection
* better/extended system info detection
* Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3 support
* better Raspberry-PI detection
* systeminformation website updated and extended with full documentation and
  examples [systeminformation.io](https://systeminformation.io)
* lot of minor improvements

Breaking Changes in version 5: you will see several breaking changes for the
sake of a more consistent API interface and to be future proof. Read the
[detailed version 5 changes](https://systeminformation.io/changes.html).

I did a lot of testing on different platforms and machines but of course there
might be some issues that I am not aware of. I would be happy if you inform me
when you discover any issues. Issues can be [opened here](https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/issues/new/choose).

## Quick Start

Lightweight collection of 50+ functions to retrieve detailed hardware, system
and OS information.

* simple to use
* get detailed information about system, cpu, baseboard, battery, memory,
  disks/filesystem, network, docker, software, services and processes
* supports Linux, macOS, partial Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, SunOS and
  Android support
* no npm dependencies

### Installation

```
npm install systeminformation --save
```

or simpler

```
npm i systeminformation
```

### Give it a try with `npx`?

You just want to give it a try - right from your command line without installing
it? Here is how you can call it with `npx`:

```
# get basic system info (System, OS, CPU)
npx systeminformation info

# obtain all static data - may take up to 30 seconds
npx systeminformation

```
#### Still need Version 4?

If you need version 4 (for compatibility reasons), you can install version 4
(latest release) like this

```
npm install systeminformation@4 âsave
```

or simpler

```
npm install systeminformation@4
```

### Usage

All functions (except `version` and `time`) are implemented as asynchronous
functions. Here a small example how to use them:

```
const si = require("systeminformation");

// promises style - new since version 3
si.cpu()
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

## Core concept

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) comes with some basic OS information, but I always wanted
a little more. So I came up to write this little library. This library is still
a work in progress. It is supposed to be used as a backend/server-side library
(it will definitely not work within a browser). It requires node.js version 4.0
and above.

I was able to test it on several Debian, Raspbian, Ubuntu distributions as well
as macOS (Mavericks, Yosemite, El Captain, Sierra, High Sierra, Mojave,
Catalina, Big Sur) and some Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, FreeBSD, OpenBSD,
NetBSD and SunOS machines. Not all functions are supported on all operating
systems. Have a look at the function reference in the docs to get further
details.

If you have comments, suggestions & reports, please feel free to contact me!

I also created a nice little command line tool called [mmon](https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/mmon)
(micro-monitor) for Linux and macOS, also available via
[github](https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/mmon) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/mmon)

### cb: Asynchronous Function Calls (callback)

Remember: all functions (except `version` and `time`) are implemented as
asynchronous functions! There are now three ways to consume them:

**Callback Style**

```
const si = require("systeminformation");

si.cpu(function (data) {
  console.log("CPU Information:");
  console.log("- manufacturer: " + data.manufacturer);
  console.log("- brand: " + data.brand);
  console.log("- speed: " + data.speed);
  console.log("- cores: " + data.cores);
  console.log("- physical cores: " + data.physicalCores);
  console.log("...");
});
```

### Promises

**Promises Style** is new in version 3.0.

When omitting callback parameter (cb), then you can use all function in a
promise oriented way. All functions (except of `version` and `time`) are
returning a promise, that you can consume:

```
const si = require("systeminformation");

si.cpu()
  .then((data) => {
    console.log("CPU Information:");
    console.log("- manufacturer: " + data.manufacturer);
    console.log("- brand: " + data.brand);
    console.log("- speed: " + data.speed);
    console.log("- cores: " + data.cores);
    console.log("- physical cores: " + data.physicalCores);
    console.log("...");
  })
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

### Async / Await

**Using async / await** (available since node v7.6)

Since node v7.6 you can also use the `async` / `await` pattern. The above
example would then look like this:

```
const si = require("systeminformation");

async function cpuData() {
  try {
    const data = await si.cpu();
    console.log("CPU Information:");
    console.log("- manufacturer: " + data.manufacturer);
    console.log("- brand: " + data.brand);
    console.log("- speed: " + data.speed);
    console.log("- cores: " + data.cores);
    console.log("- physical cores: " + data.physicalCores);
    console.log("...");
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e);
  }
}
```

## Known Issues

#### macOS - Temperature Sensor

To be able to measure temperature on macOS I created a little additional
package. Due to some difficulties in NPM with `optionalDependencies` I
unfortunately was getting unexpected warnings on other platforms. So I decided
to drop this optional dependency for macOS - so by default, you will not get
correct values.

This additional package is now also supporting Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3 machines.

But if you need to detect macOS temperature just run the following additional
installation command:

```
$ npm install osx-temperature-sensor --save
```

`systeminformation` will then detect this additional library and return the
temperature when calling systeminformations standard function `cpuTemperature()`

#### Windows Temperature, Battery, ...

`get-WmiObject` - which is used to determine temperature and battery sometimes
needs to be run with admin privileges. So if you do not get any values, try to
run it again with according privileges. If you still do not get any values, your
system might not support this feature. In some cases we also discovered that
`get-WmiObject` returned incorrect temperature values.

#### Linux Temperature

In some cases you need to install the Linux `sensors` package to be able to
measure temperature e.g. on DEBIAN based systems by running
`sudo apt-get install lm-sensors`

#### Linux S.M.A.R.T. Status

To be able to detect S.M.A.R.T. status on Linux you need to install
`smartmontools`. On DEBIAN based Linux distributions you can install it by
running `sudo apt-get install smartmontools`

#### Windows Encoding Issues

I now reimplemented all windows functions to avoid encoding problems (special
chacarters). And as Windows 11 now dropped `wmic` support, I had to move
completely to `powershell`. Be sure that powershell version 5+ is installed on
your machine. On older Windows versions (7, 8) you might still see encoding
problems due to the old powershell version.

## \*: Additional Notes

In `fsStats()`, `disksIO()` and `networkStats()` the results / sec. values
(rx\_sec, IOPS, ...) are calculated correctly beginning with the second call of
the function. It is determined by calculating the difference of transferred
bytes / IOs divided by the time between two calls of the function.

The first time you are calling one of these functions, you will get `null` for
transfer rates. The second time, you should then get statistics based on the
time between the two calls ...

So basically, if you e.g. need a value for network stats every second, your code
should look like this:

```
const si = require("systeminformation");

setInterval(function () {
  si.networkStats().then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
  });
}, 1000);
```

Beginning with the second call, you get network transfer values per second.

# Command Injection Vulnerability in systeminformation

Moderate

[sebhildebrandt](/sebhildebrandt)
published
GHSA-jff2-qjw8-5476
Apr 2, 2021

## Package

npm

systeminformation
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 5.6.4

## Patched versions

5.6.4

## Description

### Impact

command injection vulnerability

### Patches

Problem was fixed with a parameter check. Please upgrade to version >= 5.6.4

### Workarounds

If you cannot upgrade, be sure to check or sanitize service parameters that are passed to si.inetLatency(), si.inetChecksite(), si.services(), si.processLoad() ... do only allow strings, reject any arrays. String sanitation works as expected.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-21388

### Weaknesses

[CWE-77](/advisories?query=cwe%3A77)
