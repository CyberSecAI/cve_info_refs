Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21697:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient restrictions on agent access to the Jenkins controller's file system. Specifically, agents were allowed access to build directories, which are intended for storing build-related metadata during build execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inadequate Access Control:** Agents are granted overly broad permissions to read and write to build directories.
- **Insufficient Restriction on File Access:** The system does not properly limit the files and directories agents can access within the build directories, allowing read and write operations with minimal restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Read/Write:** An attacker controlling an agent can read and write to any build directory stored in Jenkins.
- **Potential Data Modification/Exfiltration:** Attackers can potentially modify build artifacts or steal sensitive data stored within build directories.
- **Limited Denial of Service:** While not the primary impact, the potential to modify build files could disrupt build processes.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Compromised Agent:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker gaining control of an agent process connected to the Jenkins controller.
- **Agent-to-Controller Communication:** The vulnerability is exploited by leveraging the communication mechanism between the agent and the controller to access files on the controller's file system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Agent Control:** The attacker needs to have control over a Jenkins agent connected to the target controller. This could be achieved through various methods (e.g., compromising a node running the agent).
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to communicate with the Jenkins controller via the compromised agent.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in Jenkins versions 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier.
- The fix implemented in Jenkins 2.319 and LTS 2.303.3 restricts agent access to build directories, only allowing access to builds currently running on the specific agent trying to access the directory.
- The fix requires updating the `Pipeline: Nodes and Processes` plugin to version 2.40 or newer.
