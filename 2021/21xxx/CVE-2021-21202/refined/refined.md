Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-21202:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a **use-after-free** vulnerability. This means that memory that has been freed is being accessed, leading to potential crashes or exploitable conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-after-free:** The core weakness is the use of memory after it has been deallocated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The provided information does not specify the exact impact, but use-after-free vulnerabilities can lead to:
    *   **Arbitrary code execution:** In some scenarios, exploiting use-after-free can enable an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system. This is the worst-case scenario for such vulnerabilities, as it grants the attacker full control over the system.
    *   **Denial-of-service (DoS):** The vulnerability can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial-of-service.
    *   **Information disclosure:** In some cases, the vulnerability can be used to leak sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The specific attack vector is not mentioned in detail within the provided text. However, since it is an issue in "extensions," this likely means the vulnerability could be triggered by a malicious or compromised browser extension.
*   The vulnerability exists within the extensions component of the Chromium browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would likely need to craft a malicious browser extension or inject malicious code that could interact with the extensions functionality.
*   The attacker needs to be able to make the browser load the crafted extensions or trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by David Erceg on 2021-03-16.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Chrome version 90.0.4430.72.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "High" severity.
*   The fix is included in various Linux distributions, such as Fedora and Debian.
*   The vulnerability is present in both Chromium and Google Chrome.

**Summary**
CVE-2021-21202 is a use-after-free vulnerability that exists in the extensions component of the Chromium browser that could potentially allow for arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability is present in Chromium and Google Chrome before version 90.0.4430.72.
