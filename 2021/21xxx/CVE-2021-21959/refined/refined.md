- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SeaConnect 370W device does not validate the server certificate during MQTTS communication, which allows a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper certificate validation (CWE-295). The `NetworkConnectTLS` function is called without providing a certificate filename, thus no certificate validation is performed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful man-in-the-middle attack would allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to control device outputs, manipulate input states, and potentially push malicious firmware updates.
- **Attack vectors**: Man-in-the-middle attack on the MQTTS communication channel between the device and the "Sealevel SeaCloud."
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be positioned to intercept and manipulate network traffic between the device and the remote server, meaning they need network access between device and server.
