Hi [@webknjaz](https://github.com/webknjaz),

Just to be sure, this isn't affecting v1.2.0 of this library, no? 🙈

I know this is a very old version but with my LTS team hat on, I want to ensure that the version of python-aiohttp in Debian Stretch is not affected. Please let me know what you think!?

Thanks for your work on this! ❤️

Sorry, something went wrong.

Hey [@utkarsh2102](https://github.com/utkarsh2102), it shouldn't since it was added in `v1.3.0`: [8c44b21](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/8c44b2189d24c1c9f94d6733b5038761451fb3bc). But that version is so outdated that nobody should be using it because it's been unsupported for years.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Perfect, thank you so much!

Even though it's not being used directly by developers, we support all the packages in Debian Stretch as a part of LTS maintenance, so we tend to fix most of the security issues by backporting the patches to stable and oldstable releases. 😄

# Open redirect vulnerability in `aiohttp` (`normalize\_path\_middleware` middleware)

Low

[webknjaz](/webknjaz)
published
GHSA-v6wp-4m6f-gcjg
Feb 25, 2021

## Package

pip

aiohttp
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=3.7.3

## Patched versions

>=3.7.4

## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

Open redirect vulnerability — a maliciously crafted link to an aiohttp-based web-server could redirect the browser to a different website.

It is caused by a bug in the `aiohttp.web_middlewares.normalize_path_middleware` middleware.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

This security problem has been fixed in v3.7.4. Upgrade your dependency as follows:

[`pip install aiohttp >= 3.7.4`](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/3.7.4/)

Package        : python-aiohttp
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-21330

Beast Glatisant and Jelmer Vernooij reported that python-aiohttp, a
async HTTP client/server framework, is prone to an open redirect
vulnerability. A maliciously crafted link to an aiohttp-based web-server
could redirect the browser to a different website.

For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.1-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-aiohttp packages.

For the detailed security status of python-aiohttp please refer to its
security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python-aiohttp>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

* Improved performance of making requests when there are no auto headers to skip -- by [:user:`bdraco`](#id91).

## 3.10.3 (2024-08-10)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed multipart reading when stream buffer splits the boundary over several read() calls -- by [:user:`Dreamsorcerer`](#id812).

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  [:issue:`8653`](#id814).
* Fixed [:py:class:`aiohttp.TCPConnector`](#id816) doing blocking I/O in the event loop to create the `SSLContext` -- by [:user:`bdraco`](#id818).

  The blocking I/O would only happen once per verify mode. However, it could cause the event loop to block for a long time if the `SSLContext` creation is slow, which is more likely during startup when the disk cache is not yet present.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  [:issue:`8672`](#id820).

### Miscellaneous internal changes

* Improved performance of [:py:meth:`~aiohttp.ClientWebSocketResponse.receive`](#id823) and [:py:meth:`~aiohttp.web.WebSocketResponse.receive`](#id825) when there is no timeout. -- by [:user:`bdraco`](#id827).

  The timeout context manager is now avoided when there is no timeout as it accounted for up to 50% of the time spent in the [:py:meth:`~aiohttp.ClientWebSocketResponse.receive`](#id829) and [:py:meth:`~aiohttp.web.WebSocketResponse.receive`](#id831) methods.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*

## 3.10.2 (2024-08-08)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed server checks for circular symbolic links to be compatible with Python 3.13 -- by [:user:`steverep`](#id849).

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  [:issue:`8565`](#id851).
* Fixed request body not being read when ignoring an Upgrade request -- by [:user:`Dreamsorcerer`](#id853).

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  [:issue:`8611`](#id859).

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  [:issue:`8632`](#id863).
* Fixed WebSocket ping tasks being prematurely garbage collected -- by [:user:`bdraco`](#id865).

  There was a small risk that WebSocket ping tasks would be prematurely garbage collected because the event loop only holds a weak reference to the task. The garbage collection risk has been fixed by holding a strong reference to the task. Additionally, the task is now scheduled eagerly with Python 3.12+ to increase the chance it can be completed immediately and avoid having to hold any references to the task.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  [:issue:`8641`](#id867).
* Fixed incorrectly following symlinks for compressed file variants -- by [:user:`steverep`](#id869).

## 3.10.1 (2024-08-03)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed WebSocket server heartbeat timeout logic to terminate [:py:meth:`~aiohttp.ClientWebSocketResponse.receive`](#id894) and return [:py:class:`~aiohttp.ServerTimeoutError`](#id896) -- by [:user:`arcivanov`](#id898).

  When a WebSocket pong message was not received, the [:py:meth:`~aiohttp.ClientWebSocketResponse.receive`](#id900) operation did not terminate. This change causes `_pong_not_received` to feed the `reader` an error message, causing pending [:py:meth:`~aiohttp.ClientWebSocketResponse.receive`](#id902) to terminate and return the error message. The error message contains the exception [:py:class:`~aiohttp.ServerTimeoutError`](#id904).

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  [:issue:`8540`](#id906).
* Fixed url dispatcher index not matching when a variable is preceded by a fixed string after a slash -- by [:user:`bdraco`](#id908).

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  [:issue:`8566`](#id910).

### Removals and backward incompatible breaking changes

* Creating [:py:class:`aiohttp.TCPConnector`](#id913), [:py:class:`aiohttp.ClientSession`](#id915), [:py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.ThreadedResolver`](#id917) [:py:class:`aiohttp.web.Server`](#id919), or [:py:class:`aiohttp.CookieJar`](#id921) instances without a running event loop now raises a [:exc:`RuntimeError`](#id923) -- by [:user:`asvetlov`](#id925).

  Creating these objects without a running event loop was deprecated in [:issue:`3372`](#id927) which was released in version 3.5.0.

  This change first appeared in version 3.10.0 as [:issue:`6378`](#id929).

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  [:issue:`8555`](#id931), [:issue:`8583`](#id933).

## 3.10.0 (2024-07-30)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed server response headers for `Content-Type` and `Content-Encoding` for
  static compressed files -- by [:user:`steverep`](#id937).

  Server will now respond with a `Content-Type` appropriate for the compressed
  file (e.g. `"application/gzip"`), and omit the `Content-Encoding` header.
  Users should expect that most clients will no longer decompress such responses
  by default.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  [:issue:`4462`](#id939).
* Fixed duplicate cookie expiration calls in the CookieJar implementation

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  [:issue:`7784`](#id941).
* Adjusted `FileResponse` to check file existence and access when preparing the response -- by [:user:`steverep`](#id943).

  The [:py:class:`~aiohttp.web.FileResponse`](#id945) class was modified to respond with

  403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found as appropriate. Previously, it would cause a
  server error if the path did not exist or could not be accessed. Checks for
  existence, non-regular files, and permissions were expected to be done in the
  route handler. For static routes, this now permits a compressed file to exist
  without its uncompressed variant and still be served. In addition, this
  changes the response status for files without read permission to 403, and for
  non-regular files from 404 to 403 for consistency.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  [:issue:`8182`](#id947).
* Fixed `AsyncResolver` to match `ThreadedResolver` behavior
  -- by [:user:`bdraco`](#id949).

  On system with IPv6 support, the [:py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.AsyncResolver`](#id951) would not fallback
  to providing A records when AAAA records were not available.
  Additionally, unlike the [:py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.ThreadedResolver`](#id953), the [:py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.AsyncResolver`](#id955)
  did not handle link-local addresses correctly.

  This change makes the behavior consistent with the [:py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.ThreadedResolver`](#id957).

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  [:issue:`8270`](#id959).
* Fixed `ws_connect` not respecting receive\_timeout` on WS(S) connection.
  -- by [:user:`arcivanov`](#id961).

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  [:issue:`8444`](#id963).
* Removed blocking I/O in the event loop for static resources and refactored
  exception handling -- by [:user:`steverep`](#id965).

  File system calls when handling requests for static routes were moved to a
  separate thread to potentially improve performance. Exception handling
  was tightened in order to only return 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found responses
  for expected scenarios; 500 Internal Server Error would be returned for any
  unknown errors.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  [:issue:`8507`](#id967).

### Features

* Added a Request.wait\_for\_disconnection() method, as means of allowing request handlers to be notified of premature client disconnections.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  [:issue:`2492`](#id970).
* Added 5 new exceptions: [:py:exc:`~aiohttp.InvalidUrlClientError`](#id972), [:py:exc:`~aiohttp.RedirectClientError`](#id974),
  [:py:exc:`~aiohttp.NonHttpUrlClientError`](#id976), [:py:exc:`~aiohttp.InvalidUrlRedirectClientError`](#id978),
  [:py:exc:`~aiohttp.NonHttpUrlRedirectClientError`](#id980)

  [:py:exc:`~aiohttp.InvalidUrlRedirectClientError`](#id982), [:py:exc:`~aiohttp.NonHttpUrlRedirectClientError`](#id984)
  are raised instead of [:py:exc:`ValueError`](#id986) or [:py:exc:`~aiohttp.InvalidURL`](#id988) when the redirect URL is invalid. Classes
  [:py:exc:`~aiohttp.InvalidUrlClientError`](#id990), [:py:exc:`~aiohttp.RedirectClientError`](#id992),
  [:py:exc:`~aiohttp.NonHttpUrlClientError`](#id994) are base for them.

  The [:py:exc:`~aiohttp.InvalidURL`](#id996) now exposes a `description` property with the text explanation of the error details.

* Added a feature to retry closed connections automatically for idempotent methods. -- by [:user:`Dreamsorcerer`](#id1014)

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  [:issue:`7297`](#id1016).
* Implemented filter\_cookies() with domain-matching and path-matching on the keys, instead of testing every single cookie.
  This may break existing cookies that have been saved with CookieJar.save(). Cookies can be migrated with this script:

  ```
  import pickle
  with file_path.open("rb") as f:
      cookies = pickle.load(f)

  morsels = [(name, m) for c in cookies.values() for name, m in c.items()]
  cookies.clear()
  for name, m in morsels:
      cookies[(m["domain"], m["path"].rstrip("/"))][name] = m

  with file_path.open("wb") as f:
      pickle.dump(cookies, f, pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  [:issue:`8062`](#id1028).

### Removals and backward incompatible breaking changes

* The shutdown logic in 3.9 waited on all tasks, which caused issues with some libraries.
  In 3.10 we've changed this logic to only wait on request handlers. This means that it's
  important for developers to correctly handle the lifecycle of background tasks using a
  library such as `aiojobs`. If an application is using `handler_cancellation=True` then
  it is also a good idea to ensure that any [:func:`asyncio.shield`](#id1031) calls are replaced with
  [:func:`aiojobs.aiohttp.shield`](#id1033).

  Please read the updated documentation on these points: <https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/web_advanced.html#graceful-shutdown> <https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/web_advanced.html#web-handler-cancellation>

  [:py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.AsyncResolver`](#id1084) was disabled by default because
  of IPv6 compatibility issues. These issues have been resolved and
  [:py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.AsyncResolver`](#id1086) is again now the default resolver.

## 3.8.3 (2022-09-21)

Attention!

This is the last [:doc:`aiohttp <index>`](#id1457) release tested under
Python 3.6. The 3.9 stream is dropping it from the CI and the
distribution package metadata.

### Bugfixes

* Increased the upper boundary of the [:doc:`multidict:index`](#id1460) dependency
  to allow for the version 6 -- by [:user:`hugovk`](#id1462).

  It used to be limited below version 7 in [:doc:`aiohttp <index>`](#id1464) v3.8.1 but
  was lowered in v3.8.2 via [:pr:`6550`](#id1466) and never brought back, causing
  problems with dependency pins when upgrading. [:doc:`aiohttp <index>`](#id1468) v3.8.3
  fixes that by recovering the original boundary of `< 7`.

## 3.8.1 (2021-11-14)

### Bugfixes

* Fix the error in handling the return value of getaddrinfo.
  getaddrinfo will return an (int, bytes) tuple, if CPython could not handle the address family.
  It will cause an index out of range error in aiohttp. For example, if user compile CPython with
  --disable-ipv6 option, but his system enable the ipv6.
  [#5901](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/5901)
* Do not install "examples" as a top-level package.
  [#6189](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/6189)
* Restored ability to connect IPv6-only host.
  [#6195](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/6195)

## 3.8.0 (2021-10-31)

### Features

* Added a `GunicornWebWorker` feature for extending the aiohttp server configuration by allowing the 'wsgi' coroutine to return `web.AppRunner` object.
  [#2988](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/2988)
* Switch from `http-parser` to `llhttp`
  [#3561](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/3561)
* Use Brotli instead of brotlipy
  [#3803](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/3803)
* Disable implicit switch-back to pure python mode. The build fails loudly if aiohttp
  cannot be compiled with C Accelerators. Use AIOHTTP\_NO\_EXTENSIONS=1 to explicitly
  disable C Extensions complication and switch to Pure-Python mode. Note that Pure-Python
  mode is significantly slower than compiled one.
  [#3828](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/3828)
* Make access log use local time with timezone
  [#3853](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/3853)

* Add a request handler type alias `aiohttp.typedefs.Handler`.
  [#4686](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/4686)
* `AioHTTPTestCase` is more async friendly now.

  For people who use unittest and are used to use [:py:exc:`~unittest.TestCase`](#id1537)
  it will be easier to write new test cases like the sync version of the [:py:exc:`~unittest.TestCase`](#id1539) class,
  without using the decorator @unittest\_run\_loop, just async def test\_\*.
  The only difference is that for the people using python3.7 and below a new dependency is needed, it is `asynctestcase`.
  [#4700](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/4700)
* Add validation of HTTP header keys and values to prevent header injection.
  [#4818](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/4818)

* Switch to external frozenlist and aiosignal libraries.
  [#5293](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/5293)
* Don't send secure cookies by insecure transports.

  By default, the transport is secure if https or wss scheme is used.
  Use CookieJar(treat\_as\_secure\_origin="<http://127.0.0.1>") to override the default security checker.
  [#5571](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/5571)
* Always create a new event loop in `aiohttp.web.run_app()`.
  This adds better compatibility with `asyncio.run()` or if trying to run multiple apps in sequence.
  [#5572](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/5572)
* Add `aiohttp.pytest_plugin.AiohttpClient` for static typing of pytest plugin.
  [#5585](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/5585)

* Fix interpretation difference of the pure-Python and the Cython-based
  HTTP parsers construct a `yarl.URL` object for HTTP request-target.

  Before this fix, the Python parser would turn the URI's absolute-path
  for `//some-path` into `/` while the Cython code preserved it as
  `//some-path`. Now, both do the latter.

* Always make sure transport is not closing before reuse a connection.

  Reuse a protocol based on keepalive in headers is unreliable.
  For example, uWSGI will not support keepalive even it serves a
  HTTP 1.1 request, except explicitly configure uWSGI with a
  `--http-keepalive` option.

  Servers designed like uWSGI could cause aiohttp intermittently
  raise a ConnectionResetException when the protocol poll runs
  out and some protocol is reused.

* Fix task cancellation when `sendfile()` syscall is used by static file
  handling. ([#3383](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3383))
* Fix stack trace for `asyncio.TimeoutError` which was not logged, when it is caught
  in the handler. ([#3414](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3414))

---

## 3.1.0 (2018-03-21)

Welcome to aiohttp 3.1 release.

This is an *incremental* release, fully backward compatible with *aiohttp 3.0*.

But we have added several new features.

The most visible one is `app.add_routes()` (an alias for existing
`app.router.add_routes()`. The addition is very important because
all *aiohttp* docs now uses `app.add_routes()` call in code
snippets. All your existing code still do register routes / resource
without any warning but you've got the idea for a favorite way: noisy
`app.router.add_get()` is replaced by `app.add_routes()`.

The library does not make a preference between decorators:

```
routes = web.RouteTableDef()

@routes.get('/')
async def hello(request):
    return web.Response(text="Hello, world")

app.add_routes(routes)

```

and route tables as a list:

```
async def hello(request):
    return web.Response(text="Hello, world")

app.add_routes([web.get('/', hello)])

```

Both ways are equal, user may decide basing on own code taste.

Also we have a lot of minor features, bug fixes and documentation
updates, see below.

### Features

* Relax JSON content-type checking in the `ClientResponse.json()` to allow
  "application/xxx+json" instead of strict "application/json". ([#2206](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2206))
* Bump C HTTP parser to version 2.8 ([#2730](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2730))

  change affects aiohttp test utils but backward compatibility is not broken
  for 99.99% of use cases. ([#2804](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2804))
* Refactor `ClientResponse` constructor: make logically required constructor
  arguments mandatory, drop `_post_init()` method. ([#2820](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2820))
* Use `app.add_routes()` in server docs everywhere ([#2830](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2830))
* Websockets refactoring, all websocket writer methods are converted into
  coroutines. ([#2836](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2836))
* Provide `Content-Range` header for `Range` requests ([#2844](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2844))

  `range.start` rather then in `range.stop` ([#2805](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2805))
* Close a connection if an unexpected exception occurs while sending a request
  ([#2827](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2827))

## Key Features

* Supports both client and server side of HTTP protocol.
* Supports both client and server Web-Sockets out-of-the-box and avoids
  Callback Hell.
* Provides Web-server with middleware and pluggable routing.

## Getting started

### Client

To get something from the web:

```
import aiohttp
import asyncio

async def main():

    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get('http://python.org') as response:

            print("Status:", response.status)
            print("Content-type:", response.headers['content-type'])

            html = await response.text()
            print("Body:", html[:15], "...")

asyncio.run(main())
```

This prints:

```
Status: 200
Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Body: <!doctype html> ...
```

Coming from [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/) ? Read [why we need so many lines](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/http_request_lifecycle.html).

### Server

An example using a simple server:

```
# examples/server_simple.py
from aiohttp import web

async def handle(request):
    name = request.match_info.get('name', "Anonymous")
    text = "Hello, " + name
    return web.Response(text=text)

async def wshandle(request):
    ws = web.WebSocketResponse()
    await ws.prepare(request)

    async for msg in ws:
        if msg.type == web.WSMsgType.text:
            await ws.send_str("Hello, {}".format(msg.data))
        elif msg.type == web.WSMsgType.binary:
            await ws.send_bytes(msg.data)
        elif msg.type == web.WSMsgType.close:
            break

    return ws

app = web.Application()
app.add_routes([web.get('/', handle),
                web.get('/echo', wshandle),
                web.get('/{name}', handle)])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    web.run_app(app)
```

[3.8.2
yanked

Sep 21, 2022

Reason this release was yanked:

This version includes overly restrictive multidict upper boundary disallowing multidict v6+. The previous patch version didn't have that and this is now causing dependency resolution problems for the users who have an "incompatible" version pinned. This is not really necessary anymore and will be addressed in the next release v3.8.3
