Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21330:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided documents and commit message, specifically the Github Security Advisory and Gentoo Security Advisory, along with the commit message, directly relate to CVE-2021-21330. They describe an open redirect vulnerability within the `aiohttp` library's `normalize_path_middleware`.

**2. Root cause of the vulnerability:**

The root cause is a flaw in the `aiohttp.web_middlewares.normalize_path_middleware`. The middleware does not properly sanitize the URL, specifically by allowing multiple slashes at the beginning of the `Location` header value. An attacker can control the redirect URL by crafting a link with multiple leading slashes.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unvalidated Redirects:** The core weakness is the lack of validation and sanitization of user-provided paths or URLs being used in redirects.
*   **Open Redirect:** The vulnerability enables an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary external domain by using a specially crafted link with multiple leading slashes.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Open Redirect:** The primary impact is an open redirect vulnerability, where an attacker can redirect users from a trusted `aiohttp`-based web server to a malicious site. This can be used for phishing attacks, where users might believe they are interacting with a legitimate service.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously crafted links:** Attackers craft malicious links with multiple leading slashes that, when processed by the vulnerable middleware, redirect users to an attacker-controlled site.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs with multiple leading slashes.
*   The target server needs to be running a vulnerable version of `aiohttp` and using `normalize_path_middleware`.
*   No specific network positioning is required, as the attack vector involves a maliciously crafted link.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in aiohttp version 3.7.4 and later.
*   A workaround is to avoid using `aiohttp.web_middlewares.normalize_path_middleware` if upgrading is not possible.
*   The vulnerability is classified as **Low severity**.

*   The patch applies a regex to replace multiple leading slashes with a single slash, effectively mitigating the open redirect vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was found by Beast Glatisant and tracked down by Jelmer Vernooij.
*   The vulnerability was introduced in version 1.3.0
