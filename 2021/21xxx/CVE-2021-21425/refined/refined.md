Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authentication and authorization checks within the `AdminController.php` of GravCMS. Specifically, the `taskSaveDefault` method can be called without authentication, and this method directly modifies YAML configuration files based on user-controlled input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The `taskSaveDefault` method within `AdminController` can be accessed without any authentication.
*   **Arbitrary YAML Write/Update:** The `taskSaveDefault` method, when triggered, allows writing arbitrary content to YAML files by manipulating POST data and the `view` parameter in the URL. This is due to the `getConfigurationData` method being used to update configuration files based on a user-controlled `type` parameter, which when set to  `config/`  will write directly to config files.
*   **Lack of Authorization Checks:** The vulnerable `taskSaveDefault` method does not perform authorization checks before modifying configuration data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Configuration Changes:** Attackers can modify system configuration by writing arbitrary data to YAML files located under `/config`. This includes settings for the website title, caching mechanisms, and other critical parameters.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**
    *   By modifying the `scheduler.yaml` file, an attacker can add custom scheduled jobs, leading to arbitrary command execution on the server.
    *   By modifying system configuration to use Redis as a cache, an attacker can potentially hijack admin sessions if they control the Redis server. After gaining admin access, an attacker can install malicious plugins for further exploitation and persistence.
*   **Website Defacement:** Changing the site's configuration can also allow for defacement by altering the content of the website.
*   **Account Hijacking:** By manipulating configuration to use a controlled Redis server, attackers can potentially hijack administrator sessions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The attacker sends specially crafted POST requests to the `/admin` path, exploiting the language switcher plugin to bypass load balancer access controls.
*   **Manipulated URI:** The attacker uses the `/en/admin` path to bypass the load balancer and access admin functions via the `langswitcher` plugin. The `view` parameter within the URL is also manipulated to target specific configuration files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the GravCMS server to send HTTP requests.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Understanding of GravCMS:** Some understanding of GravCMS's internal structure, configuration files, and the structure of HTTP requests would be required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered through a combination of bypassing load balancer restrictions by using the `langswitcher` plugin of GravCMS to access the admin controller and exploiting the lack of authentication in the `taskSaveDefault` method.
*   The `admin-nonce` is extracted from the login form and used in subsequent requests to perform the exploit.
*   The provided Metasploit module automates the exploitation process, using the scheduler to achieve remote code execution by base64 encoding a PHP payload that is then run by the scheduled task.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 1.10.8 of Grav Admin Plugin.
*   A workaround is to block access to the `/admin` path from untrusted sources.
