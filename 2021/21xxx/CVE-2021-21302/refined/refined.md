Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21302:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization in the CSV export functionality, specifically within the `ModuleGraph` class of PrestaShop.
-  The vulnerability occurs in the shop search keywords via the admin panel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CSV Injection:** The application fails to sanitize user-controlled input before exporting it to a CSV file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious formulas/commands into the CSV, which can be executed when the file is opened in spreadsheet software (e.g., Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice Calc).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By crafting malicious CSV payloads, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on a victim's machine when the victim opens the exported CSV file with vulnerable spreadsheet software. This could lead to data exfiltration, system compromise, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves injecting malicious content via the shop search keywords in the admin panel. This would then be exported via the CSV export feature.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs access to the admin panel with the ability to modify search keywords in PrestaShop. This suggests that the attacker is likely an authorized user who could exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involved adding an `escapeCell` method to the `ModuleGraph` class. This method adds double quotes around the cell content and adds a single quote before the content if it begins with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@`. This ensures that spreadsheet software will treat the content as a string, not a formula, mitigating the injection.
- The commit `782b1368aa4e94dafe28f57485bffbd8893fbb1e` introduces the fix by adding the `escapeCell` method and calling it during CSV export, effectively preventing CSV injection.
- The commit also contains unit tests for the `escapeCell` method.
