Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21237:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how the Git LFS client on Windows handles command execution. Specifically, when Git LFS needs to execute a Git command, it does not explicitly specify the directory to look for the command executable, relying instead on the operating system's search path. On Windows, the current directory is included (and preferred) in this search path by default. This allows a malicious actor to place a fake `git.exe` or `git.bat` in the current working directory of a Git repository, which will then be executed by Git LFS instead of the legitimate Git binary when a git command is invoked, due to how Go handles command execution on Windows.
* This vulnerability was the result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-27955.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Command Execution:** The vulnerability is due to the insecure way Git LFS invokes Git commands on Windows, inadvertently allowing an attacker to hijack execution by placing a malicious executable in the current directory of the repository.
*   **Improper Path Resolution:** The vulnerability is caused by how Go includes and prefers the current directory when resolving the command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a Windows machine. The attacker can achieve this by placing a malicious executable file in the same directory where Git LFS is operating.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Repository:** The attack vector involves a malicious Git repository containing a specifically crafted `git.exe` or `git.bat` file.
*   **Local System:** The attack is local to the user's machine. The malicious repository must be cloned, and the user must execute commands that trigger Git LFS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious Repository:** The attacker needs the ability to create and control a Git repository where they can place the malicious executable.
*  **User Interaction:** The user needs to clone or interact with the malicious repository. The user must also execute a Git command that triggers git-lfs.
*   **Windows Environment:** The target must be using Windows, as this vulnerability specifically affects Windows systems due to how Go handles command execution on that OS.

**Additional details:**
*   The fix for this vulnerability was implemented in Git LFS v2.13.2, which resolves the issue by always using PATH to pre-resolve paths before handing them to Go.
* The advisory mentions that a user reported this vulnerability responsibly.
* The advisory assigns a CVSS score of 7.2 with metrics of AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N, highlighting a local attack vector, high attack complexity, low privileges required, required user interaction, changed scope, high confidentiality impact, high integrity impact and no availability impact.

In summary, CVE-2021-21237 is a vulnerability in Git LFS on Windows that allows for arbitrary code execution if a user interacts with a malicious repository that contains a fake `git.exe` or `git.bat` file. The vulnerability was addressed in Git LFS v2.13.2.
