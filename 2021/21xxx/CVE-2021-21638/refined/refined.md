Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21638:

**CVE-2021-21638**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Team Foundation Server Plugin does not enforce proper permission checks and lacks CSRF protection on an HTTP endpoint.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** The plugin fails to verify if the user has the necessary permissions to access a specific HTTP endpoint.
    *   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The affected HTTP endpoint doesn't require POST requests, making it vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can leverage the missing permission check and CSRF vulnerability to:
    *   Connect to an attacker-specified URL.
    *   Use attacker-specified credentials IDs, which could be obtained through another vulnerability (CVE-2021-21636), to capture credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker would need to induce a user to make a crafted request to the vulnerable HTTP endpoint. This could be done through a malicious link, a crafted web page, or by other means.
    *   The attacker also needs to have Overall/Read permissions and knowledge of credentials IDs.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permissions in Jenkins.
    *   The attacker needs to trick a user into interacting with a crafted link or page to exploit the CSRF vulnerability
    *   The attacker needs to have knowledge of credentials IDs that may be obtained via other vulnerability.
*   **Affected Plugin:** Team Foundation Server Plugin (tfs) versions 5.157.1 and earlier.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory explicitly mentions that as of the publication date, there was no fix available for this vulnerability in the Team Foundation Server Plugin.
*   The advisory mentions that CVE-2021-21638 is related to the CSRF vulnerability, while CVE-2021-21637 is related to the missing permission check in the same vulnerable endpoint.
