# Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions in the OpenAPI Generator Maven plugin

Moderate

[wing328](/wing328)
published
GHSA-867q-77cc-98mv
Apr 27, 2021

## Package

maven

org.openapitools:openapi-generator-maven-plugin
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 5.1.0

## Patched versions

5.1.0

## Description

### Impact

Using `File.createTempFile` in JDK will result in creating and using insecure temporary files that can leave application and system data vulnerable to attacks. This vulnerability only impacts unix-like systems where the local system temporary directory is shared between all users. This vulnerability does not impact Windows or modern versions of MacOS.

OpenAPI Generator Maven plug-in creates insecure temporary files during the code generation process. It creates insecure temporary files to store the OpenAPI specification files provided by the users and these temporary files can be read by any users in the system.

The impact of this vulnerability is information disclosure of the contents of the specification file to other local users.

### Patches

The issue has been patched with `Files.createTempFile` and released in the v5.1.0 stable version.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

* Use Files.createTempFile instead

cc @OpenAPITools/generator-core-team

### PR checklist

* Read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* Pull Request title clearly describes the work in the pull request and Pull Request description provides details about how to validate the work. Missing information here may result in delayed response from the community.
* Run the following to [build the project](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator#14---build-projects) and update samples:
  ```
  ./mvnw clean package
  ./bin/generate-samples.sh
  ./bin/utils/export_docs_generators.sh

  ```

  Commit all changed files.

  This is important, as CI jobs will verify *all* generator outputs of your HEAD commit as it would merge with master.

  These must match the expectations made by your contribution.

  You may regenerate an individual generator by passing the relevant config(s) as an argument to the script, for example `./bin/generate-samples.sh bin/configs/java*`.

  For Windows users, please run the script in [Git BASH](https://gitforwindows.org/).
* File the PR against the [correct branch](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/wiki/Git-Branches): `master`, `5.1.x`, `6.0.x`
* If your PR is targeting a particular programming language, @mention the [technical committee](https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator/#62---openapi-generator-technical-committee) members, so they are more likely to review the pull request.

Sorry, something went wrong.
