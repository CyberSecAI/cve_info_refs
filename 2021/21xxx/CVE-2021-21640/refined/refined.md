Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-21640:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from improper validation of view names during view creation in Jenkins. When a user submits a form to create a new view, the view name is included twice within the submission. While one instance is validated, the other instance is used to actually create the view.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core weakness is that Jenkins does not consistently validate the view name, utilizing a separate, unvalidated value for the view creation.
- **Bypass of Validation:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass intended view name validation mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Creation of Invalid or Duplicate Views:** Attackers can create views with invalid names (potentially containing special characters or otherwise restricted values) or duplicate view names, which can disrupt the intended functionality and organization of the Jenkins instance.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the Jenkins web interface during the view creation process. The attacker manipulates the form submission to include a malicious view name in the unvalidated field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication:** An attacker must have valid credentials to access the Jenkins instance.
- **Permissions:** Specifically, the attacker needs the `View/Create` permission, which allows them to create new views.

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-21640 is a medium severity vulnerability caused by inconsistent input validation of the view name in Jenkins. This allows authenticated attackers with `View/Create` permission to create views with invalid or duplicate names by exploiting the inconsistent use of two view name fields in the view creation form submission.
