Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21910:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect default permissions assigned to the installation directory of Advantech R-SeeNet. Specifically, the "Authenticated Users" group is granted "Full/Change" privileges over critical service executable files within the installation directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Default Permissions (CWE-276):** The core issue is that the installer sets overly permissive access controls on the installation directory, allowing authenticated users to modify critical service executable files.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Because the affected services (mysql, SnmpMonSvs, Apache2.2) run with NT SYSTEM authority, replacing these files allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with the highest privileges on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation enables a local attacker to gain complete control over the affected system.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By replacing the service executables, attackers can execute any code they desire with NT SYSTEM privileges.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could potentially alter or delete data, install malware, or perform any other malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system.
- **File Replacement:** The attacker must replace the legitimate service executable files (mysqld.exe, R_SeeNet.exe, httpd.exe) with their own malicious versions.
- **Service Restart:** The attacker needs to trigger a service restart for the malicious executable to be launched.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have an account on the system with "Authenticated Users" group membership which has write access to the service files.
- They must be able to replace the service's executable files.
- They need to be able to trigger the service to restart or restart it themselves.

**Additional Information:**

- This vulnerability is related to two other similar vulnerabilities, CVE-2021-21911 and CVE-2021-21912, which affect other services within the same software installation.
- The vulnerable software is Advantech R-SeeNet version 2.4.15 (30.07.2021).
- The vendor has released a patch.
