Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-21688:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `FilePath#reading(FileVisitor)` method within the Jenkins agent-to-controller file access control subsystem. This method does not properly validate or restrict operations performed by a `FileVisitor`, allowing unrestricted read access using specific operations, such as creating archives or using `#copyRecursiveTo`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient access control:** The `FilePath#reading(FileVisitor)` method lacks proper checks to ensure that the file operations performed by the visitor are within allowed directories, leading to unrestricted read access.
*   **Unrestricted FileVisitor Operations**: The `FileVisitor` could perform operations on files outside the allowed directories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker controlling an agent process can use the vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller's file system. This can lead to exposure of sensitive information such as credentials, source code, or other configuration details.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Agent:** An attacker who has control over an agent process can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to the Jenkins controller, invoking `FilePath#reading(FileVisitor)` with a `FileVisitor` that will read files outside allowed directories.
*   **FileVisitor operations**: An attacker who can control the FileVisitor can perform read operations on arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have control over a Jenkins agent process that can communicate with the Jenkins controller.
*   The attacker doesn't need to have any specific privileges on the Jenkins controller itself to exploit the vulnerability. They just need to be able to execute code on a Jenkins agent that is connected to the controller.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is part of a group of vulnerabilities related to path filtering bypasses.
*   The fix for this vulnerability involves correctly rejecting operations if they operate on files outside allowed directories.
*   This vulnerability has been present since the fix for SECURITY-144 in 2014.
