- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A command injection vulnerability exists in the "Startup Configuration" page of vSphere Replication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command Injection vulnerability, allowing execution of arbitrary shell commands.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor with administrative access can execute shell commands on the underlying system, potentially leading to remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a network-based attack where an authenticated administrator injects commands through the "Startup Configuration" page of vSphere Replication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs administrative access to vSphere Replication to exploit this vulnerability.
