  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A bypass of the fix for CVE-2020-26231 was discovered, allowing an attacker to escape the Twig sandbox.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability allows specific Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An authenticated backend user with specific CMS permissions can execute arbitrary PHP code even when `cms.enableSafeMode` is enabled. This is due to bypassing a fix of a previous vulnerability. It allows for arbitrary code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting specific malicious Twig code.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An authenticated backend user with `cms.manage_pages`, `cms.manage_layouts`, or `cms.manage_partials` permissions is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker must be able to write Twig code within the CMS."
