# Bypass of fix for CVE-2020-26231, Twig sandbox escape

Moderate

[daftspunk](/daftspunk)
published
GHSA-fcr8-6q7r-m4wg
May 2, 2021

## Package

composer

october/cms
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

1.0.471, 1.1.1

## Patched versions

1.0.472, 1.1.2

## Description

### Impact

A bypass of [CVE-2020-26231](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r89v-cgv7-3jhx "CVE-2020-26231") (fixed in 1.0.470/471 and 1.1.1) was discovered that has the same impact as [CVE-2020-26231](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r89v-cgv7-3jhx "CVE-2020-26231") & [CVE-2020-15247](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-94vp-rmqv-5875 "CVE-2020-15247"):

An authenticated backend user with the `cms.manage_pages`, `cms.manage_layouts`, or `cms.manage_partials` permissions who would **normally** not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to `cms.enableSafeMode` being enabled is able to write specific Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary PHP.

This is not a problem for anyone that trusts their users with those permissions to normally write & manage PHP within the CMS by not having `cms.enableSafeMode` enabled, but would be a problem for anyone relying on `cms.enableSafeMode` to ensure that users with those permissions in production do not have access to write & execute arbitrary PHP.

### Patches

Issue has been patched in Build 472 (v1.0.472) and v1.1.2.

### Workarounds

Apply [f63519f](https://github.com/octobercms/october/commit/f63519ff1e8d375df30deba63156a2fc97aa9ee7) to your installation manually if unable to upgrade to Build 472 or v1.1.2.
