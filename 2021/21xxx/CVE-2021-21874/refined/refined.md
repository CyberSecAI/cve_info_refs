Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the `keypasswd` POST parameter, within the Lantronix PremierWave 2050 Web Manager. This parameter is directly injected into `openssl` commands executed by the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OS Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is OS command injection (CWE-78). The application directly incorporates user-provided input into system commands without validation, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges on the affected device. This provides the attacker with complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/ssl` endpoint of the Web Manager interface.
*   **`keypasswd` Parameter:** The attack vector uses the `keypasswd` POST parameter to inject malicious commands into `openssl` commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the "Administration > SSL > Credentials" page of the Web Manager interface. This is mentioned as "authenticated-by-default"
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the device's web interface.
*   **Knowledge of the Device:** The attacker would need to know the vulnerable POST parameter and the device's `/ssl` endpoint

**Summary of CVE-2021-21874:**
This CVE specifically refers to the DSA `openssl` command injection vulnerability, where the `keypasswd` parameter is injected into the following command:
```
openssl dsa -passin pass:%s -in /tmp/ssl_work/key_in.enc -out /tmp/ssl_work/key_in.pem
```
The attacker can then insert OS commands using the `keypasswd` parameter, leading to arbitrary code execution with root privileges
