- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists in the digital media player (DMS) of ZTE's residential gateway product. It's triggered when a USB disk with a symbolic link is inserted into the gateway.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The system improperly handles symbolic links, allowing access to unauthorized directory information. This constitutes an information leak vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can access unauthorized directory information via the symbolic link on the inserted USB disk, leading to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is physical. The attacker must insert a specially crafted USB drive containing a symbolic link into the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires physical access to the device and the ability to insert a USB disk. They must also be capable of creating a USB drive containing a symbolic link.
