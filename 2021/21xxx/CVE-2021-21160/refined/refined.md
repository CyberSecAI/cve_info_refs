Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-21160:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow located in the WebAudio component of the Chromium browser.
*   Specifically, it arises within the `blink::AudioDelayDSPKernel::ProcessKRate` method.
*   The vulnerability occurs due to an incorrect calculation within the `memcpy` operation where a negative size is used, causing a large memory copy.
* The issue occurs when the `automationRate` of the `delayTime` field of a `DelayNode` object is changed from "a-rate" to "k-rate" during processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow, meaning that a specially crafted input can write data past the allocated buffer on the heap, potentially overwriting other data structures.
*   **Incorrect Size Calculation:** The root cause is the incorrect handling of a `remainder` variable as a signed integer and a failure to validate if `buffer_end` is smaller than `read_pointer`, leading to a negative value being used in `memcpy` which is then cast to `size_t`, causing it to become very large.
*   **State Confusion**: The runtime switch from "a-rate" to "k-rate" within the `AudioDelayDSPKernel` causes an internal state error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** The heap buffer overflow, if successfully exploited, could allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. This is because heap overflows can often be manipulated to overwrite function pointers or other critical data.
*   **System Compromise:** With arbitrary code execution, an attacker could potentially gain full control of the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Page:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted HTML web page that includes malicious JavaScript code to manipulate the WebAudio API.
*   **User Interaction:** The user has to visit a malicious website to trigger the vulnerability, making it a drive-by download vulnerability that requires user action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host Web Content:** The attacker needs a platform to host the malicious HTML file. This could be on their own server or via a compromised website.
*   **Knowledge of WebAudio API:** The attacker needs to understand the intricacies of the WebAudio API to craft the malicious HTML and JavaScript to trigger the vulnerability by manipulating `automationRate`.
*   **Heap Grooming:** To achieve code execution, attackers need to groom the heap in a specific way, which involves some sophisticated exploitation techniques.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by Marcin 'Icewall' Noga of Cisco Talos.
*   The vulnerability was present in at least Chrome versions 89.0.4383.0 and 90.0.4390.0.
*   Google is aware of reports that an exploit for CVE-2021-21166 (another vulnerability patched in the same update) exists in the wild, though this does not specifically refer to CVE-2021-21160
*   The fix involves correcting the size parameter used in the memcpy operation.

This information is extracted and summarized from the provided content and should be useful for understanding the nature and potential impact of CVE-2021-21160.
