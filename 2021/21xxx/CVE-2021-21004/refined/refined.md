Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21004:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from a lack of proper sanitization of LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) data when displayed in the web-based management interface of the affected Phoenix Contact FL SWITCH SMCS series products.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. It stems from the web-based management interface's failure to neutralize user-controlled input when displaying data received from LLDP frames.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious code (e.g., JavaScript) into the web-based management interface by crafting LLDP frames that contain the malicious payload. When an administrator views the interface via their web browser, this malicious code is executed within the context of their browser session. This can lead to various impacts such as:
  - Information disclosure: The attacker can potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive data.
  - Defacement: The attacker can alter the appearance of the web interface.
  - Phishing: The attacker can use the legitimate interface to redirect to malicious login forms.
  - Account takeover: If the attacker can gain control of session cookies, they could potentially hijack a user's session and gain access to the system using the hijacked user's privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
The primary attack vector is through the network, by sending crafted LLDP frames to the vulnerable device. These frames contain the malicious XSS payload that the web interface doesn't properly sanitize and displays.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker must be able to send network traffic, particularly crafted LLDP frames, to the affected Phoenix Contact device. They do not need to have any specific user credentials on the device, but they do need to be on the same network segment or have a network path to it. Exploitation requires user interaction (UI:R) where an administrator has to access the web interface and view the malicious LLDP data.

**Additional Notes**
- The advisory provides more detail than the standard CVE description, which is a placeholder.
- The provided text also includes the CVSS vector, which is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N), indicating that the attack vector is network-based, with low complexity and user interaction is required, scope changed, with low confidentiality, low integrity impact and no availability impact.
