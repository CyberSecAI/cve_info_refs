Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21659:

**Root Cause:** The URLTrigger plugin, in versions 0.48 and earlier, does not properly configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The plugin utilizes an XML parser without disabling external entity resolution.
- This vulnerability is categorized as an XXE (XML External Entity) injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can extract secrets from the Jenkins controller or agent.
- Server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks are possible.
- Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks are also possible through crafted XML documents.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves controlling the contents of an URL that points to an XML document, which the Jenkins instance polls.
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted XML document that leverages external entities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs "Job/Configure" permission or must otherwise control the contents of the URL to an XML document being examined. This means they have some level of control over the Jenkins job configuration or the external XML source being polled.
