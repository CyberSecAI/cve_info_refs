Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-21377

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The OMERO webclient does not validate URL redirects on login or when switching groups. This lack of validation allows redirection to arbitrary, untrusted sites.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Inadequate URL validation: The application fails to properly validate URLs used for redirection after login or group switching, leading to an open redirect vulnerability.
-  CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can potentially redirect users to malicious websites after they log in or switch groups. This could be used for phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other malicious activities.
- The vulnerability has a high severity rating.
- The CVSS score is 6.6 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C/CR:H/IR:H/AR:H/MAV:N/MAC:H/MPR:L/MUI:R/MS:U/MC:H/MI:H/MA:H)

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through crafted URLs used during login or group switching.
- An attacker could provide a malicious URL as the redirection target.
- Requires user interaction, as the user needs to click on the crafted link/perform the action to be redirected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  An attacker needs to craft a malicious URL that can be used during login or group switching to redirect the user to a malicious website.
-  The attacker requires a user to interact with the malicious link/URL, thus a user with low privileges can also trigger the vulnerability with the crafted URL.

**Additional Details:**
-  The vulnerability is present in OMERO.web versions prior to 5.9.0.
-  The fix involves adding URL validation before redirecting. External URLs are not allowed by default unless listed in the `omero.web.redirect_allowed_hosts` setting.
- There is no mentioned workaround, so upgrading to version 5.9.0 or higher is needed.

**Summary of Changes in the fix:**

The commit `952f8e5d28532fbb14fb665982211329d137908c` includes changes related to this vulnerability.  Specifically, the commit includes:
-   **`omeroweb/settings.py`**: Adds a new setting `omero.web.redirect_allowed_hosts` which allows specifying allowed hosts for redirection, helping to address the open redirect vulnerability.
-   **`omeroweb/webclient/views.py`**: Includes changes to the `validate_redirect_url` function to check if a redirect URL is safe, referencing the new `REDIRECT_ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting in `settings.py`

This commit addresses the vulnerability by implementing the URL validation and enabling the configuration of allowed redirect hosts, preventing the open redirect.
