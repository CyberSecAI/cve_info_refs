IMPORTANT! BEFORE YOU START!

NetWorker 19.4.x & 19.3.x provides new features and improvements for Ease of Use, Reliability, Availability,
Serviceability and Java Enablement over previous NetWorker versions.  See NetWorker 19.4 and 19.3 Release
materials for more information.  IMPORTANT:  Dell EMC now separately offers NetWorker Runtime Environment
(NRE) which provides critical functionality for Java with NetWorker (see below for more info).

Customers who have been successful with installing, upgrading, and configuring NetWorker 19.x and 18.x have
engaged DELL EMC Professional Services and/or used the available free training.  If unprepared, you might
encounter issues including backup failures during and after upgrading from earlier NetWorker releases.

To request DELL EMC Professional Services, contact a DELL EMC Sales representative. (1-866-GET-EMC2) For
more information about available services, go to the DELL EMC Service Offering Index and search for NetWorker
(select Filter > N > NetWorker).

** Note: Professional Services assistance is recommended when first upgrading to a NetWorker 19.x, 18.x (from
an older NetWorker version).  Applying a new cumulative to an existing NetWorker 19.x or 18.x version does not
require Professional Services assistance.

Java Enablement via NetWorker Runtime Environment (NRE) version 8.0.x

The latest NRE version 8.0.10, released on 6th Aug 2021, contains 3 new security fixes for Oracle Java Standard
Edition.
Please refer the following documents to learn more:
https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2021.html#AppendixJAVA
https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2021.html#AppendixJAVA

NetWorker Runtime Environment (NRE) provides an installer package to deliver a current Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) for NetWorker.  It is recommended that customers use the latest NRE which is provided as
part of the NetWorker product entitlement; however, customers are free to continue to use any NetWorker
supported JRE version they have licensed directly from Oracle. Existing NetWorker users that wish to use NRE
should reference the NetWorker Runtime Edition Readme Guide for details on the upgrade.
NetWorker Runtime Environment is versioned starting at 8.0.x since NRE currently provides Java 8. The Java
version provided with NRE will not directly correspond to Java updates, however new NRE versions will be
released with Java updates as necessary.
NRE is available for download for Windows, Linux, MacOS and Debian.

New versions of NRE will be posted in the NetWorker downloads section and will be noted in the monthly
NetWorker Newsletters. Search for  NetWorker Runtime Environment
at https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/product-support/product/networker/drivers

For more information about Java Enablement via NRE, refer to the NetWorker Runtime Environment KB article
https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/533770,  NetWorker Runtime Environment Readme Guide, NetWorker
Installation Guide and NetWorker Release Notes  available at https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/product-
support/product/networker/docs

TRAINING and RESOURCES

NetWorker Troubleshooting Tool (NTT)
Dell EMC provides the NetWorker Troubleshooting Tool (NTT) as a back-end solution which helps NetWorker users identify potential
network problems that could affect NetWorker backup.
Data from a production server will be backed up to NetWorker Server over the network. Any problem with the network may break
the backup, cloning or recovery job.
The NetWorker Troubleshooting Tool (NTT) helps NetWorker users identify potential network problems which may affect NetWorker
functionality (NVT) and other tools to help identify issues with the NetWorker Server (nsrpchk), vProxy server (vProxy Health Check)
and log gathering (nsrget), NSRTools.

Currently the tool is not supported on NVE.

NTT incorporates 9 tools into one GUI interface:

Network Validation Test – Testing network connectivity of a NetWorker Datazone
NetWorker Proactive Check Tool (NSRPCHK) – Provides status of last DR, daemon status, warnings from logs and possible OS issues.
vProxy Health Check Tool – vProxy health check utility provides an automated, efficient and human readable way to perform first-
step/basic self-diagnostic for NetWorker VMware Protection (NVP) appliance.
NSRDDRCHK – The NetWorker cross check tool (nsrddrchk) provides the ability to perform cross checks between the NetWorker
media database (MMDB) and Data Domain mtree contents.
SIGT – System Information Gathering Tool – Allows you to log in to a remote host and collect system details.
NSRGET – Provides log gathering and reporting for issues.
Resource Monitoring Tool – Collects utilization statistics of system and NetWorker related modules.
Remote NTT Activation:  With NTT installed on a Windows client with or without NetWorker, NTT can be used to run NSRPCHK and
NSRGET on a remote Linux NetWorker Server.
NSRTools — Collects and presents multiple graphical overviews of backup distribution, activities, logs and diagnostic data.

The NTT tool is available for download at https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/product-support/product/networker/drivers
(Search for NTT) for both Windows and Linux operating systems. The NTT user documentation is included within the NTT tool.

Please refer to https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/516676 for configuration guidance.
