Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-21358

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The Form Designer backend module of the TYPO3 Form Framework is vulnerable to XSS. This likely means that user-supplied input to the Form Designer is not being properly sanitized or encoded before being displayed in the backend interface, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CWE-79:** Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
*   The core issue is a lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding in the Form Designer backend module of the Form Framework

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the backend interface.
*   Successful exploitation could lead to various impacts, including:
    *   Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information from backend users.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of a logged-in backend user.
    *   Defacing the backend interface.
    *   Potentially gaining further access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the TYPO3 backend, specifically the Form Designer module.
*   The attacker would need to manipulate form data that is subsequently rendered in the backend.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Backend Access:** The attacker needs a valid backend user account with access to the Form module to exploit this vulnerability. This suggests the vulnerability is not directly exploitable by unauthenticated users.
*   **Knowledge of XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious XSS payloads to inject into the vulnerable form fields.
*   **UI Interaction:** The exploit requires the victim to interact with the modified backend interface, specifically the part where the injected code is rendered.

**Additional Information:**
*   **Affected Versions:** TYPO3 CMS versions 10.2.0-10.4.13 and 11.0.0-11.1.0 are affected.
*   **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in TYPO3 versions 10.4.14 and 11.1.1.
*   **CVSS Score:**  A CVSS v3.1 score of 5.0 is provided with vector `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C`. This translates to:
    *   **AV:N** (Attack Vector: Network)
    *   **AC:L** (Attack Complexity: Low)
    *   **PR:L** (Privileges Required: Low)
    *   **UI:R** (User Interaction: Required)
    *   **S:C** (Scope: Changed)
    *   **C:L** (Confidentiality Impact: Low)
    *   **I:L** (Integrity Impact: Low)
    *   **A:N** (Availability Impact: None)
    *   **E:F** (Exploit Code Maturity: Functional)
    *   **RL:O** (Remediation Level: Official Fix)
    *   **RC:C** (Report Confidence: Confirmed)
*   The vulnerability was reported by Richie Lee and fixed by Andreas Fernandez.
*   The fix involves updating to the patched TYPO3 versions.
