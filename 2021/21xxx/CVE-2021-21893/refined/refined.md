- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the JavaScript engine of Foxit Softwareâ€™s PDF Reader due to improper handling of certain events of form elements (like text fields or buttons).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free (CWE-416) in the V8 Javascript engine within Foxit Reader when handling form element events. Specifically, the `event.target` object is freed after an event handler executes, but a reference to the object is kept. When this reference is later accessed, a use-after-free condition occurs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can gain control of freed memory via JavaScript, which can then lead to memory corruption and code execution.
- **Attack vectors**:
    -  Opening a specially crafted PDF document.
    -  Visiting a specially crafted, malicious site if the browser plugin extension is enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    -   The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a malicious PDF file or visiting a malicious website.
