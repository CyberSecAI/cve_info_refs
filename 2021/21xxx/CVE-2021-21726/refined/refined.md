- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input verification of parameters in the diagnostic function interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Input validation vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with high privileges can cause process exception by repeatedly inputting illegal parameters, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through the diagnostic function interface by inputting malicious parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs high privileges on the affected system.
