Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21418:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the newsletter conditions field. An employee with access to modify this field can insert malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code injected into the newsletter conditions field is stored and then executed within the context of the user's browser when the page is loaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser when the page containing the newsletter subscription form is loaded.
- **Potential Data Theft and Session Hijacking:** This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.
- **Website Defacement:** The attacker could alter the appearance or functionality of the affected page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker, an employee with access, must inject malicious javascript code into the newsletter conditions field.
- The injected code is then executed when a user views the newsletter subscription form on the front office.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have administrative access to modify the newsletter conditions field within the application's settings.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found in the PrestaShop module `ps_emailsubscription`.
- The affected versions are <=2.6.0.
- The vulnerability is patched in version 2.6.1, where the newsletter conditions field is escaped using `Tools::htmlentitiesUTF8`
- The fix involves escaping the newsletter condition field before displaying it on the front-end to prevent the browser from rendering the script.
- The template files `views/templates/front/subscription_execution.tpl`, `views/templates/hook/ps_emailsubscription-column.tpl` and  `views/templates/hook/ps_emailsubscription.tpl` were modified to remove the `nofilter` modifier.
