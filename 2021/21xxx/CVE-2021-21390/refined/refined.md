Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21390:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how MinIO's S3 Signature V4 chunked reader handled chunk signature verification.  The reader would return unverified data to the caller and only verify the chunk signature once the end of the chunk payload was reached. This allowed for a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacker to potentially modify request bodies that were supposed to be integrity-protected by chunk signatures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incomplete Signature Verification:** The core weakness is that the server did not verify chunk signatures before passing the chunk data along.
- **Bypass of Integrity Checks:** By sending a false chunk size that is much larger than the actual data sent, an attacker could cause the server to skip signature verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **MITM Modification of Request Bodies:** An attacker could modify the contents of a request during transit.
- **Data Integrity Issues:** The server would process the modified data as if it were legitimate, leading to data integrity issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Based:** The attack would occur over the network, by intercepting and modifying HTTP PUT requests using aws-chunked encoding.
- **MITM:** An attacker needs to be positioned as a man-in-the-middle to intercept the network traffic between the client and the MinIO server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Interception:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the MinIO server.
- **HTTP Request Modification:** The attacker needs to be able to modify the chunk size in the HTTP request.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves buffering the entire chunk, verifying the signature, and only then passing the data along. This prevents the server from working with potentially corrupted data.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by using TLS, which MinIO SDKs will automatically disable chunked encoding signature when the server endpoint is configured with TLS.
- The vulnerability is specifically related to "aws-chunked" encoding and affects PUT requests.
