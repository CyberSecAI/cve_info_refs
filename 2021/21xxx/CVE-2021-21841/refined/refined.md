Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-21841:

**Root Cause:** Integer overflow in the `sbgp_box_read` function of the GPAC library when parsing the "sbgp" atom.

**Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Integer Overflow:** When calculating the required memory allocation size for sample group entries, the library multiplies the number of entries (read from the input) by the size of a `GF_SampleGroupEntry`. This multiplication can overflow on 32-bit systems, resulting in a smaller memory buffer than expected.
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** After the undersized buffer is allocated, the function proceeds to read the sample data into this buffer. Since the allocated buffer is smaller than required, the write operation overflows it causing memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Memory Corruption:** The heap-based buffer overflow leads to memory corruption, which can potentially be leveraged by an attacker.
*   **Code Execution:** In a successful exploitation scenario, this memory corruption could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the library.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious MPEG-4 File:** An attacker can craft a malicious MPEG-4 file that contains a "sbgp" atom with a large number of entries, triggering the integer overflow during allocation and subsequent buffer overflow.
*   **User Interaction:** An attacker needs to convince a user to open or process this crafted MPEG-4 file using the vulnerable GPAC library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious MPEG-4 file.
*   The attacker needs to induce a user to process the crafted file with an application using the vulnerable GPAC library.

**Technical Details from the provided content:**
The vulnerability lies within the `sbgp_box_read` function:
1.  The library reads a 32-bit integer representing the number of sample group entries from the atom.
2.  The library checks this number of entries against the atom's 64-bit size, but it's an insufficient check.
3.  The library multiplies the number of entries by the size of a `GF_SampleGroupEntry` structure. This calculation can cause an integer overflow and lead to undersized memory allocation.
4. The function reads two 32-bit integers into the undersized buffer, resulting in memory corruption.

The crash information shows the AddressSanitizer detecting a heap-buffer-overflow when writing into the undersized buffer allocated during processing of the "sbgp" atom in the `sbgp_box_read` function.
