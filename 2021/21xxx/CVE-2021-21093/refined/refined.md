Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-21093:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within the processing of SGI files in Adobe Bridge. This is caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core vulnerability is a memory corruption, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** Insufficient validation of user-supplied data in SGI files allows an attacker to trigger the memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. This means the attacker gains the same privileges as the user running Adobe Bridge.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a specially crafted, malicious SGI file.
*   **Malicious Web Page:**  The user could be redirected to a malicious page hosting the vulnerable SGI file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to induce a user to open the malicious file or visit a malicious page containing the exploit.
*   **File Creation/Hosting:** The attacker must be able to create or host the malicious SGI file.
