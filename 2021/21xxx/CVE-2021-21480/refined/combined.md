# Onapsis Security Advisory 2021-0012: SAP Manufacturing Integration
and Intelligence lack of server side validations leads to RCE

## Impact on Business

By abusing a Code Injection in SAP MII, an authenticated user with SAP
XMII Developer
privileges could execute code (including OS commands) on the server.
Thus, they would
be able to do everything a SAP Administrator is able to do. Some
possible actions are:

* Access to the SAP databases and read/modify/erase any record in any table
* Use these servers to pivot to other servers
* Place malware to later infect end users
* Modify network configurations and potentially affect internal networks

## Advisory Information

* Public Release Date: 06/14/2021
* Security Advisory ID: ONAPSIS-2021-0012
* Researcher(s): Nicolas Raus

## Vulnerability Information

* Vendor: SAP
* Affected Components:
  * XMII 15.1 lower than SP006 PL 000062
  * XMII 15.2 lower than SP003 PL 000038
  * XMII 15.3 lower than SP001 PL 000022
  * XMII 15.4 lower than SP001 PL 000007

  (Check SAP Note #3022622 for detailed information on affected releases)

* Vulnerability Class: [CWE-94] Improper Control of Generation of Code
('Code Injection')
* CVSS v3 score: 9.9 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
* Risk Level: Critical
* Assigned CVE: CVE-2021-21480
* Vendor patch Information: SAP Security Note #3022622

## Affected Components Description

SAP MII is an SAP NetWeaver AS Java based platform that enables
real-time production monitoring
and provides extensive data analysis tools. It functions as a data hub
between SAP ERP and
operational applications such as manufacturing execution systems
(MES). The software collects
data from production machinery, delivering real-time insights into its
performance and efficiency.

Affected components:

* XMII 15.1 lower than SP006 PL 000062
* XMII 15.2 lower than SP003 PL 000038
* XMII 15.3 lower than SP001 PL 000022
* XMII 15.4 lower than SP001 PL 000007

(Check SAP Note #3022622 for detailed information on affected releases)

## Vulnerability Details

An integral part of SAP MII is the Self-Service Composition
Environment (SSCE) that can
be used to design dashboards by simple drag and drop.  This dashboard
creation functionality
applies some client side validations which are then not performed on
the back-end, this
situation could allow an attacker to craft a malicious request with
executable code which
will be stored on the server. When such an infected dashboard is
opened in production by a
user having a minimum of authorizations, the malicious content gets
executed, leading to
remote code execution in the server.

## Solution

SAP has released SAP Note #3022622 which provide patched versions of the
affected components.

The patches can be downloaded from
<<https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3022622>>.

Onapsis strongly recommends SAP customers to download the related
security fixes and apply them to the affected components in order to
reduce business risks.

## SAP Security Patch Day

The security maintenance of installed SAP software is key to continuously protect also against new types of attacks or newly identified potential weaknesses.

Based on feedback from customers, partners and SAP user groups, SAP has launched a regular **SAP Security Patch Day**, scheduled for the **second Tuesday of every month** — which has been synchronized with the Security Patch Day of other major software vendors.

On these SAP Patch Days, SAP publishes software corrections as **SAP Security Notes**, focused solely on security to protect against potential weaknesses or attacks. Access [SAP Security Notes in SAP for Me](https://me.sap.com/app/securitynotes), then select *All Security Notes*, to get the complete list of all SAP Security Notes. **We recommend that you implement these corrections at a priority**. Several tools are available to help identify, select and implement these corrections.

SAP categorizes SAP Security Notes as *Patch Day Security Not*es and *Support Package Security Notes*, with the sole purpose of making you focus on important fixes on patch days and the rest to be implemented automatically during SP upgrades. For details refer to the [SAP Security Notes FAQ](/en/my-support/knowledge-base/security-notes-news/security-notes-faqs.html). Security fixes for SAP NetWeaver based products are also delivered with the support packages.

Starting June 11, 2019, for all new SAP Security Notes with high or very high severity we deliver fix for Support Packages shipped within the last 24 months\* for the versions under Mainstream Maintenance and Extended Maintenance. This is extended from the previous Support Package coverage of 18 months.

Notes with low or medium priority contain corrections in at least the newest support package in all mainstream and extended maintenance releases.

\*For information on areas with an exception from the 24 months maintenance strategy, refer to the [SAP Security Notes FAQ](https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/knowledge-base/security-notes-news/security-notes-faqs.html?anchorId=section_237298869 "exceptions").
