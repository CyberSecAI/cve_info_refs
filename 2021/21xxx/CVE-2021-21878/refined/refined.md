- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from an authorization mismatch between the privileges used when executing Python applications and the privileges used when browsing the file system via the "Filesystem > Browse" page in the Lantronix PremierWave 2050 web interface. Specifically, the web manager application does not drop privileges when interacting with the file system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Local File Inclusion (LFI): The vulnerability allows an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system.
    - Privilege Escalation/Authorization bypass: The application executes python scripts with reduced privileges, but does not enforce those privilege restrictions when browsing the filesystem through the web interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read arbitrary files from the file system, potentially disclosing sensitive information like passwords.
- **Attack vectors**:
    1.  An attacker uploads and executes a malicious Python script via the "Administration > Applications" interface of the web interface. The script creates a symbolic link to a sensitive file.
    2.  The attacker uses the "Filesystem > Browse" page of the web interface to access the symbolic link, thereby reading the content of the targeted file with elevated privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the web interface.
    - The attacker needs to be authorized to upload and execute python scripts and browse the filesystem.
