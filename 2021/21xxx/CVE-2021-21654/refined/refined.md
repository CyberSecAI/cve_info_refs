The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21654.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The P4 Plugin does not perform permission checks in multiple HTTP endpoints that implement connection tests. These endpoints also do not require POST requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing permission check: The plugin does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions to access the connection test endpoints.
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF): The connection test endpoints do not require POST requests, which makes it possible to perform CSRF attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can connect to an attacker-specified Perforce server using attacker-specified username and password.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with Overall/Read permission can exploit the missing permission check vulnerability.
- An attacker can perform a CSRF attack to trigger the connection test endpoints.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission to exploit the missing permission check.
- The attacker can initiate a CSRF attack to trigger the vulnerable endpoints.
