- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An integer overflow in the `parse_dicom_meta_info` function when parsing a malformed DICOM file. Specifically, the size of a stack buffer is calculated based on a size value read from the DICOM file. If this size is set to `0xFFFFFFFF`, an integer overflow occurs during a size check, causing a stack buffer overflow when data is later copied.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The stack-based buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this by providing a specially crafted, malformed DICOM file to a vulnerable application that uses the Accusoft ImageGear library.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious DICOM file to the vulnerable application.
