```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerabilities exist due to misuse of prepared statements, stored procedures, and SQL concatenation. Despite initial sanitization, variables used to build SQL queries lose their protection when invoked against the database, leading to SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerabilities are triggered via authenticated HTTP requests to the ‘device_list’ page with specially crafted values in multiple parameters.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application. Cross-site request forgery can also be used to exploit the vulnerabilities."
