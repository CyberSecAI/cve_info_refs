Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21701:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Performance Plugin for Jenkins does not properly configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. Specifically, the `TaurusParser` class is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references. The plugin's XML parser processes external entities, which allows for the inclusion of external resources.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious XML file that, when parsed by Jenkins, allows the attacker to:
    - Extract secrets from the Jenkins controller.
    - Perform server-side request forgery (SSRF).
    - Disclose sensitive information in the context of the service account.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker must be able to control the content of the workspace, specifically the XML report file that the plugin processes.
- The attacker crafts an XML file containing external entity references, specifying URIs to external resources that the XML parser will access and embed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to control files within the Jenkins workspace (Job/Workspace control permission, in some form).
- No user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability (UI:N), which makes exploitation more dangerous.
- The attacker needs to have at least Overall/Read and Item/Read permissions.

**Additional Information**
-  The vulnerability is present in Performance Plugin versions 3.20 and earlier.
-  As of the publication of the advisory, no fix was available.
-  The vulnerability was reported by Adith Sudhakar.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 6.5 with vector AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.
