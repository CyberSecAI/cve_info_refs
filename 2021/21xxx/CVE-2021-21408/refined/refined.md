  "CVE-2021-21408": {
    "description": "Template authors could run restricted static php methods.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way Smarty handles access to static PHP methods within templates. Specifically, it fails to properly restrict access to these methods when accessed dynamically through a variable class name (e.g., {$test = \"mysecuritystaticclass\"}{$test::square(5)}).",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Inadequate restrictions on static class access in templates",
      "Dynamic static class access bypasses security settings"
    ],
    "impact": "Template authors could bypass security restrictions and execute restricted static PHP methods leading to potential code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious template authors can exploit this vulnerability by crafting templates that include dynamic static class calls"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to author or modify Smarty templates",
        "Access to a Smarty template engine that allows template execution with insecure static_classes configuration."
    ],
    "patches": [
      "Smarty version 3.1.43 and 4.0.3 include a fix that prevents evasion of the `static_classes` security policy. This is achieved by explicitly disallowing dynamic static class access through variables in templates."
    ],
    "affected_versions": [
      "Versions prior to 3.1.43",
      "Versions 4.0.0 up to but not including 4.0.3"
    ]
