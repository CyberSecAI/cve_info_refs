The provided content relates to CVE-2021-21614.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Bumblebee HP ALM Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Credentials stored in plain text in the plugin's global configuration file `com.agiletestware.bumblebee.BumblebeeGlobalConfig.xml`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Credentials can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system. This could lead to unauthorized access or compromise of systems relying on the stored credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker with access to the Jenkins controller file system can directly read the configuration file and obtain the stored credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have access to the Jenkins controller file system. This would typically require local access to the server or potentially compromised administrative access within the system.
