The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21827.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a heap-based buffer overflow in the `DecodeTreeBlock` function of AT&T Labs Xmill 0.7, specifically when handling `TREETOKEN_ATTRIBWHITESPACE` tokens.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The code loads a UINT32 from the input file and uses it as the length for a buffer. It then performs a `memcpy` without verifying if the buffer is large enough to handle the specified length, leading to a heap buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted XMI file that triggers the vulnerable code path during decompression.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to provide a malicious XMI file to the vulnerable application (xdemill) to trigger the heap overflow. No special position or privileges are required. The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of a crafted XMI file.
