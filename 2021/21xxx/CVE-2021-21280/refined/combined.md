# Out-of-bounds write when processing 6LoWPAN extension headers

Moderate

[joakimeriksson](/joakimeriksson)
published
GHSA-r768-hrhf-v592
Jun 18, 2021

## Package

Contiki-NG

## Affected versions

< 4.6

## Patched versions

4.6

## Description

### Impact

It is possible to cause an out-of-bounds write in Contiki-NG when transmitting a 6LoWPAN packet with a chain of extension headers. Unfortunately, the written header is not checked to be within the available space, thereby making it possible to write outside the buffer.

The statement causing the buffer overlow is on line 1274 in the os/net/ipv6/sicslowpan.c module:

```
memcpy((uint8_t*)exthdr + 2, hc06_ptr, len);

```

In this statement, the exthdr variable points into the uncompressed packet buffer, where an extension header pointed to by the `hc06_ptr` variable is written. The buffer overflow can occur because the lack of validation of the len variable, which is read from the compressed input packet.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG 4.6.

### Workarounds

Users can apply the patch in [Contiki-NG PR #1409](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1409).

### @nvt **[nvt](/nvt)** commented [Oct 9, 2020](#issue-718193915)

When processing external headers in sicslowpan, a long chain of headers could possibly overflow the uip\_buf variable.

In the code below, which follows the now inserted check, the writes to the exthdr struct could result in an out-of-bounds write.

exthdr = (struct uip\_ext\_hdr \*)ip\_payload; exthdr->len = (2 + len) / 8 - 1; exthdr->next = next;

A packet test that should trigger the bug is included in the PR.

Sorry, something went wrong.
