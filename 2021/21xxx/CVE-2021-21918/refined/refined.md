The content is related to CVE-2021-21918.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the misuse of prepared statements in conjunction with stored procedures and SQL concatenation. Specifically, variables used to build the SQL query, despite initial sanitization, lose their protection when executed against the database. The final prepared statement is taken directly from a variable without parameter bindings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- Improper sanitization of user-controlled input
- Use of SQL concatenation

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands into the database.
- This can lead to information disclosure or other malicious actions.
- In the provided example, a time-based blind SQL injection is demonstrated via the `SLEEP` function.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests to the `/r-seenet/index.php?page=company_list` page.
- Manipulation of the `name_filter` and `ord` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be authenticated to the application.
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests.
- The high privilege super-administrator account needs to be used to achieve exploitation without cross-site request forgery attack.
