{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `nimble` package manager utilizes the `httpclient` library, which by default does not validate peer certificates during SSL/TLS connections. Additionally, `nimble` falls back to insecure HTTP connections if the secure HTTPS connection fails and is vulnerable to command injection via crafted package metadata.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation",
      "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')",
      "CWE-348 Use of Less Trusted Source"
    ],
    "impact": "Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, arbitrary code execution, and the installation of malicious packages.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "MitM attack to intercept and modify the `packages.json` file.",
      "Exploiting the fallback to insecure HTTP connections.",
      "Crafted package metadata containing shell command injection."
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to intercept network traffic (MitM) or control the package repository to inject malicious package data."
