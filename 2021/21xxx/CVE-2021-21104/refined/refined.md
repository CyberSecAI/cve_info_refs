- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory corruption
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The document does not provide specific details on the attack vector, but it is implied that by opening a specially crafted file, the memory corruption can be triggered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to create a specially crafted file that, when opened by a vulnerable version of Adobe Illustrator, will trigger the memory corruption. The attacker would likely need to convince a user to open the malicious file.
