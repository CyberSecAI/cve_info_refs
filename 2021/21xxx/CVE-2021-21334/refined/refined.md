Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2021-21334:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in containerd's CRI (Container Runtime Interface) plugin. When multiple containers, launched via containerd's CRI implementation, share the same image, there is a risk of environment variables leaking from one container to another. Specifically, incorrect environment variables, potentially including those meant for other containers, can be received by a container.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Environment Variable Leakage:**  The core issue is that containers started through containerd's CRI plugin can receive the wrong environment variables. This is due to the way environment variables are handled when containers using the same image are launched.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The most significant impact is the potential for sensitive information to be unintentionally shared between containers. If these containers operate with different security contexts, an attacker could potentially gain access to data that they should not have.
- **Privilege Escalation:** A malicious container, running within the same network namespace and with an effective UID of 0 but otherwise reduced privileges, can utilize the leaked information to run new processes with elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Container Sharing Network Namespaces:** Exploitation requires the malicious container to run in the same network namespace as the vulnerable `containerd-shim`. Typically, this means using the "host" network namespace (e.g., using `docker run --net=host` or `hostNetwork: true` in a Kubernetes pod).
- **Shared Images:** Multiple containers launched from the same image can expose each other to this vulnerability.
- **Rapid Container Launches:** Launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image in rapid succession increases the chance of exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to run a container within the same network namespace as the vulnerable containerd-shim.
- **Effective UID 0:** The attacker's container needs to have an effective UID of 0, though it can otherwise have reduced privileges.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects containerd versions <= 1.3.9, 1.4.0, 1.4.1, 1.4.2, and 1.4.3.
- **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in containerd versions 1.3.10 and 1.4.4.
- **Workarounds:** The content suggests workarounds for some specific configurations or environments but no general workarounds.
- **Mitigation:** The content advises against sharing namespaces with the host and advocates for running containers with a reduced set of privileges, a non-zero UID, and isolated namespaces. It also recommends using AppArmor to deny access to all abstract sockets as a workaround.
- **Specific Commit:** The fix for this vulnerability is implemented in commit `05f951a3781f4f2c1911b05e61c160e9c30eaa8e` of the containerd/containerd repository and related commits in the containerd/cri repository.
