The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21920 and describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities affecting Advantech R-SeeNet application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the misuse of prepared statements within the application. Specifically, the application concatenates SQL queries using stored procedures and dynamically generated parameters. Although the parameters are initially sanitized using `mysqli_real_escape_string`, this protection is lost when the resulting query is incorporated into a stored procedure and executed against the database, due to the way the SQL query is constructed using string concatenation into the `@sql` variable without parameter binding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in the `user_list` page, specifically through four parameters:
- `surname_filter` (CVE-2021-21920)
- `name_filter` (CVE-2021-21921)
- `username_filter` (CVE-2021-21922)
- `company_filter` (CVE-2021-21923)
These parameters are passed via HTTP GET requests and are used to filter user data. The application uses these parameters to construct a SQL query that is then executed without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the database. This could allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete data, bypass authentication, or even execute arbitrary code on the database server. The report focuses on the ability to use `SLEEP()` to confirm the injection, highlighting a time-based blind SQL injection vector.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `/r-seenet/index.php?page=user_list` page. The vulnerable parameters are appended to the URL as query parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be authenticated to the application with administrative privileges, or needs to leverage cross-site request forgery.
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
The attacker can manipulate the vulnerable parameters to construct a malicious SQL query.
