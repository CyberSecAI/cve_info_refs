CVE-2021-33508 issued, but I forgot that the original reporter already reserved CVE-2021-3313 which is public now with his report.  My bad.

The reporter prefered to request the CVE for this one, so waiting to
hear back.

Subject: Plone security hotfix 20210518

A Plone security hotfix was released on Tuesday, May 18 2021.
For details, see <https://plone.org/security/hotfix/20210518>
Most CVE numbers are not yet issued. I will request them from Mitre shortly.

BTW, I am following the instructions at
<https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security#cve-requests>
to first post to this list, then request CVEs at Mitre, then reply to my
own post.
I don't see many other people doing it in this order. Is that page still
accurate?

Versions Affected: All supported Plone versions (4.3.20 and any earlier
4.3.x version, 5.2.4 and any earlier 5.x version).

Versions Not Affected: None. Earlier versions may be affected, but the
hotfix has not been tested on them.

The patch addresses several security issues:

The fixes will be incorporated in future release Plone 5.2.5.
