Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-21336:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from missing access control on the `enumerateRoles` method within the ZODB Role Manager plugin of Products.PluggableAuthService. This method, intended for internal use, was inadvertently made publicly accessible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The core weakness is the exposure of sensitive information, specifically the names of roles defined in the ZODB Role Manager. 
- **Missing Access Control:** The `enumerateRoles` method lacked proper access restrictions, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can enumerate and list the names of roles defined within the ZODB Role Manager. This may allow attackers to gain understanding of the permission structure of a Plone site, potentially leading to further attacks.
- The impact is considered **low** as it only reveals role names, not the roles themselves or other more sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is exposed through the publicly accessible `enumerateRoles` method.
- An attacker can exploit the vulnerability without authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs network access to the Plone site.
- No prior authentication is required.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves adding the `@security.private` decorator to the `enumerateRoles` method, effectively restricting access to only authorized users/roles.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.6.0 of Products.PluggableAuthService.
- The vulnerability was reported by chutchut.
- This vulnerability is related to other vulnerabilities fixed in the Plone security hotfix 20210518.
