Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21248:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way OneDev dynamically generates Groovy classes to define parameters of a Build spec. User-controlled input, specifically the 'pattern' field of a build job parameter, was not properly sanitized before being used in a `@Pattern` annotation within the dynamically generated Groovy code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Groovy Script Injection:** The primary vulnerability is that arbitrary Groovy code could be injected into the generated class. The application fails to sanitize user-provided input that is later used in generating code. This allows a malicious user to inject a static constructor which will execute arbitrary code on the server during compilation and instantiation of the generated class.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application did not adequately escape or sanitize user-provided input, allowing special characters to break out of expected contexts. Specifically, double quotes were not escaped in the regex pattern.
- **Dynamic Code Generation without proper validation:** The use of dynamic code generation using unsanitized user-controlled data opens the application to code injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (RCE):** The injected Groovy code allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server where OneDev is running.
- **Post-Auth RCE:** The attacker needs to be authenticated, but post-authentication they can leverage the vulnerability via malicious build specifications.
- **System Compromise:** RCE can lead to full system compromise, including access to sensitive data, modification of system configurations, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Build Spec Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the build specification parameters, specifically the "pattern" field of text parameters, to include malicious Groovy code.
- **HTTP Requests:** The attacker would craft malicious build job parameter through a legitimate interface of the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated to the OneDev application.
- **Build Specification Control:** The attacker needs the ability to define or modify build specifications, including the ability to control parameters for build jobs.
