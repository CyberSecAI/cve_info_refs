Based on the provided content, this commit addresses a bug related to video capture state in the Wire iOS application. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The issue stems from the `SelfVideoPreviewView` not correctly managing the video capture state. Specifically, it appears that video capture was not being stopped when there was no self video stream and when the view was not in a window.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The primary weakness was the incorrect handling of the video capture state, where the video capture might continue even when it should be stopped. This could potentially lead to resource leaks or unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact of this vulnerability is not severe but could result in the following:

*   **Resource consumption:** Video capture might continue unnecessarily, leading to increased battery usage and potentially performance issues.
*   **Unexpected behavior:** The application might exhibit unexpected behavior related to video capture when the self video stream is not active.

**Attack Vectors:**

There is no direct attack vector in the usual sense. The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the application's logic. An attacker cannot directly exploit this.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

No specific attacker capabilities or position are required to trigger this issue, as it is a bug in the application's code.

**Technical Details:**

The fix involves several code changes:

*   **`SelfVideoPreviewView.swift`:**
    *   The `previewView` property was changed from `private let` to a `var`.
    *   The `didSet` observer on the `stream` property was modified to call `updateCaptureState()`.
    *   A `deinit` method was added to ensure that `stopCapture()` is called when the view is deallocated.
    *   The `didMoveToWindow()` method was modified to call `startCapture()` and `updateCaptureState()` only when the view's window is present.
    *   The `updateCaptureState()` method now handles both start and stop capture based on the video state.

*   **`VideoGridViewController.swift`:**
    *   A check was added to ensure that `stopCapture()` is called on the `SelfVideoPreviewView` when the self stream is not available.

*   **`SelfVideoPreviewViewTests.swift`:**
    *   A series of unit tests were added to verify that the `startVideoCapture` and `stopVideoCapture` methods are being called based on the video state: `.started`, `.stopped`, `.paused`, `.badConnection`, and `.screenSharing`.

The commit also includes changes to the `project.pbxproj` file to add the new test file to the project.
