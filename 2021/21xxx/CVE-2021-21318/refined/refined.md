Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21318:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Opencast's search service handles access control lists (ACLs) for series and their associated episodes. Specifically, when an episode is removed from a series, the search service fails to properly update or remove the series' access control settings, leading to inconsistencies. The access control list for the series metadata might have broader access rules than the merged access rules of all remaining events or the series metadata might still be available even after all episodes are removed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Inconsistent ACL Updates:** The core issue is that Opencast doesn't correctly update the series' ACL when episodes are removed or when the last episode is removed.
2.  **Incorrect Merging of ACLs:** When adding an episode to a series, the series' ACL was updated with episode's ACL, leading to stricter access, and potentially making public series private if one episode is made private and then republished.
3.  **Series Metadata Exposure:** The series metadata could remain accessible even when all associated episodes are deleted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** The primary impact is the potential for users to access series metadata even when they shouldn't. This can occur if the series metadata has broader access rules than the remaining episodes.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Series metadata could remain accessible even after all episodes within the series are removed.
*   **Denial of Access:** Publishing an episode with strict access rules could overwrite the series access and cause denial of access for users without superuser privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Episode Removal:** The vulnerability is triggered when an episode is removed from a series, but the series access is not correctly updated to reflect this change.
*   **Episode Republishing:** Republishing an episode with a different access control could change the series' access to a stricter one.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would require the ability to remove episodes or republish episodes within a series on the Opencast platform. This would typically require some level of authorized access within the Opencast environment.
* The attacker would need to have a good understanding of how the ACLs are managed in Opencast to be able to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Opencast versions prior to 9.2.
*   The fix involves ensuring that series access is recalculated based on remaining published episodes when an episode is deleted.
*   The fix also includes unpublishing a series when the last episode is removed.
*   The provided commit `b18c6a7f81f08ed14884592a6c14c9ab611ad450` on github contains the code changes that fix this issue.

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-21318 is a vulnerability related to incorrect access control handling within the Opencast search service. It occurs when series access isn't properly updated after an episode is removed. This could lead to unintended access or denial of access to the series and its metadata. The patch addresses this by correctly merging ACLs and ensuring series access is updated on episode removal and that series are unpublished when there are no episodes left.
