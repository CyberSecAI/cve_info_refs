- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper privilege management in Dell PowerScale OneFS 9.1.0.x.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An authenticated user with `ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_SSH` and/or `ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_CONSOLE` privileges can elevate their privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to privilege escalation, potentially allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access and control over the affected system. The vulnerability is considered critical, especially because it also affects Compliance mode.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the system is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with either `ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_SSH` or `ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_CONSOLE` privileges on the affected system.
