Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-21608:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper output escaping of button labels in the Jenkins UI. Specifically, button labels are not sanitized or encoded, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they interact with the affected UI elements.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary script execution:**  An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Data theft:** Attackers could potentially steal sensitive information like session cookies or credentials.
- **Account compromise:**  Malicious scripts could be used to perform actions on behalf of the victim user.
- **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the appearance or functionality of the Jenkins UI for other users.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Jenkins UI. Specifically, by manipulating the button labels. For example, this can be done via the Pipeline `input` step, where button labels are user-controlled.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated user:** The attacker must be a Jenkins user with the ability to control button labels. This means they need the 'Job/Configure' permission to modify pipeline configurations, or similar permissions depending on the context where the buttons are being manipulated.
- **User Interaction:** The victim user must interact with the affected buttons, in order to trigger the injected malicious script, as this is a stored XSS.

**Summary of CVE-2021-21608:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of output escaping for button labels in the Jenkins UI. This allows an attacker with the ability to control button labels to inject malicious scripts that execute when other users interact with the UI. This can lead to various malicious outcomes, including data theft, account compromise, and UI defacement.
