The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21294.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `blaze-core` library, which underlies `http4s-blaze-server`, accepts connections without any limits on its selector pool. This means that when a service is overloaded and cannot handle the current request load, the server continues to accept new connections and adds them to an unbounded queue. Each new connection consumes a socket handle, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unbounded connection acceptance: The server does not limit the number of incoming connections, which can lead to resource exhaustion.
- The `MaxActiveRequests` middleware only limits the number of concurrently processed connections and not the number of connections held open.
- Incorrect passing of `maxConnections` parameter in versions 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M2, and 1.0.0-M14, making it impossible to change the Blaze default of 512 connections.
- The NIO2 backend does not respect `maxConnections` and has been deprecated.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Resource exhaustion: Unbounded acceptance of connections leads to exhaustion of socket handles, which are a scarce OS resource.
- Service degradation: Overloaded services can be further degraded due to the acceptance of new connections.
- Circumventing circuit breakers: The unbounded queue can interfere with higher level circuit breakers that are based on failed connections.

**Attack vectors:**
-  An attacker could send a high volume of connection requests to the server, overwhelming it and leading to denial of service (DoS).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to establish TCP connections with the server.
