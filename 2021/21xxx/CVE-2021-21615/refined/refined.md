Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21615:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a Time-of-check to Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition when handling symbolic links in workspace browsers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **TOCTOU Race Condition:** The file browser checks if a path is within the allowed directory, but the check is performed separately from the actual file access. This allows an attacker to modify the file system between the check and the use, for example by replacing a regular file with a symbolic link.
- **Unvalidated Symlink Following:** The workspace browser follows symbolic links without proper validation and restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** Attackers can bypass intended directory access restrictions and read files outside of the workspace directory.
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information stored in files outside the workspace, including those on the Jenkins server, could be exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Symbolic Link Creation:** Attackers create symbolic links within the workspace (or related locations like archived artifacts, `$JENKINS_HOME/userContent/`). These links point to arbitrary files outside the workspace.
- **Workspace Browser:** The attacker uses the workspace file browser in the Jenkins UI to follow those symbolic links, thus accessing and reading arbitrary files on the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Job/Workspace Permission:** The attacker needs Job/Workspace permissions to browse workspace files.
- **Control over Workspace Contents:**  The attacker must be able to create or modify contents of a job's workspace. This can be done via Job/Configure permission or the ability to change SCM contents.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability stems from an improperly applied fix for a previous vulnerability (SECURITY-1452 / CVE-2021-21602).
- The fix involves ensuring the check and the use of symlinks in workspace browsers is not separated by a time-gap where the file-system can be modified by an attacker.
- Jenkins versions 2.276 and LTS 2.263.3 are patched and no longer vulnerable.
