# Jenkins Security Advisory 2021-01-26

This advisory announces vulnerabilities in the following Jenkins deliverables:

* Jenkins (core)

## Descriptions

### Arbitrary file read vulnerability in workspace browsers

**SECURITY-2197
/
CVE-2021-21615**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Description:**

Due to a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition, the file browser for workspaces, archived artifacts, and `$JENKINS_HOME/userContent/` follows symbolic links to locations outside the directory being browsed in Jenkins 2.275 and LTS 2.263.2.

This allows attackers with Job/Workspace permission and the ability to control workspace contents, e.g., with Job/Configure permission or the ability to change SCM contents, to create symbolic links that allow them to access files outside workspaces using the workspace browser.

|  | This issue is caused by an incorrectly applied fix for SECURITY-1452 / CVE-2021-21602 in the [2021-01-13 security advisory](/security/advisory/2021-01-13/#SECURITY-1452). |
| --- | --- |

Jenkins 2.276, LTS 2.263.3 no longer differentiates the check and the use of symlinks in workspace browsers.

## Severity

* SECURITY-2197:
  [Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

## Affected Versions

* **Jenkins weekly**
  up to and including
  2.275
* **Jenkins LTS**
  up to and including
  2.263.2

## Fix

* **Jenkins weekly**
  should be updated to version
  2.276
* **Jenkins LTS**
  should be updated to version
  2.263.3

These versions include fixes to the vulnerabilities described above. All prior versions are considered to be affected by these vulnerabilities unless otherwise indicated.

## Credit

The Jenkins project would like to thank the reporters for discovering and
[reporting](/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities)
these vulnerabilities:

* **Wadeck Follonier, CloudBees, Inc. and Daniel Beck, CloudBees, Inc.**
  for
  SECURITY-2197

SECURITY-2197 / CVE-2021-21615
Due to a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition, the file
browser for workspaces, archived artifacts, and
`$JENKINS_HOME/userContent/` follows symbolic links to locations outside
the directory being browsed in Jenkins 2.275 and LTS 2.263.2.

This allows attackers with Job/Workspace permission and the ability to
control workspace contents, e.g., with Job/Configure permission or the
ability to change SCM contents, to create symbolic links that allow them to
access files outside workspaces using the workspace browser.
