{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Envoy's JWT Authentication filter when used with the `allow_missing` requirement under a `requires_any` configuration. The `AnyVerifier` component, responsible for aggregating results from child verifiers, incorrectly converted a `JwtUnknownIssuer` error (indicating a JWT with an unrecognized issuer) into a `JwtMissing` error. This misinterpretation effectively bypassed authentication by treating tokens with the wrong issuer as if no token was present, thus satisfying the `allow_missing` condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer not listed in the allowed provider list. This can lead to unauthorized access to resources and may also impact integrity if the token is used to protect against write or modification actions.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can send a request with a JWT token that has an issuer not configured in the JWT filter's provider list.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction, as the vulnerability can be exploited by any client sending crafted requests.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability was introduced by PR #13839 and fixed by PR #15194. The vulnerable versions include Envoy 1.17.0. The fix prefers `JwtUnknownIssuer` over `JwtMissing`, thus correcting the error aggregation behavior and preventing the bypass. A temporary mitigation is provided by using RBAC with the jwt filter's metadata.",
