Based on the provided document, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-21070:

*   **Root Cause:** Uncontrolled search path element. This typically means that the application, when searching for a resource (such as a library, executable, or configuration file), includes a path that can be manipulated by an attacker.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is that the software doesn't properly control which directories/paths are searched when loading resources, making it vulnerable to an uncontrolled search path element issue.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to privilege escalation in the context of the current user. This indicates an attacker could potentially gain higher level privileges on the system than what is normally allowed.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves exploiting the uncontrolled search path to load a malicious resource instead of the intended one. The specific way this is done would be implementation dependent, but could involve placing a malicious DLL file in a manipulated directory that is searched prior to a legitimate one.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be able to write files or manipulate resources in a location that would be searched by RoboHelp before the legitimate location. They must also be able to create a malicious resource that would be executed by RoboHelp. They would need to have local access to the user's system or some other mechanism to achieve this.
