Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21240:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a regular expression used to parse authentication headers, specifically the `www-authenticate` header. The regex, named `WWW_AUTH_RELAXED`, exhibited cubic complexity when processing strings with many non-breaking space characters (`\xa0`). This caused a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to excessive CPU consumption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **REDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service):** The core vulnerability is a poorly written regular expression that is susceptible to catastrophic backtracking.
- **Cubic Complexity:** The regex's performance degrades cubically with the length of the input string containing `\xa0` characters.
- **Overlapping groups:** The regex contains overlapping groups that contribute to the backtracking problem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** A malicious server can send a crafted `www-authenticate` header with many `\xa0` characters, causing the `httplib2` client to consume excessive CPU resources while parsing the header. This can lead to a denial-of-service condition on the client side, making it unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious HTTP Server:** An attacker can set up a malicious HTTP server or compromise an existing server.
- **Crafted `www-authenticate` Header:** The server responds to client requests with a specially crafted `www-authenticate` header containing long strings of `\xa0` characters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to control a HTTP server:** The attacker needs to control the server responses, specifically the `www-authenticate` header.
- **Ability to send requests to the malicious server:** The attacker can cause a client to send request to the malicious server

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable Regex:** The vulnerable regex was present in `httplib2/python3/httplib2/__init__.py` (and the corresponding Python 2 file)
```
WWW_AUTH_RELAXED = re.compile(
r"^(?:\s\*(?:,\s\*)?([^ \t\r\n=]+)\s\*=\s\*\"?((?<=\")(?:[^\\\"]|\\.)\*?(?=\")|(?<!\")[^ \t\r\n,]+(?!\"))\"?)(.\*)$"
)
```
- **Vulnerable Character:** The non-breaking space character (`\xa0`) was the main trigger for the backtracking issue.
- **Cubic Complexity:** The time it takes to parse the header increases cubically with the number of `\xa0` characters.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was mitigated by replacing the vulnerable regular expression with a parser based on the `pyparsing` library, which is not vulnerable to this type of attack. The fix is included in httplib2 version 0.19.0.

**Workaround:**
A temporary workaround can be used in versions before the fix was released:
```python
import httplib2
httplib2.USE_WWW_AUTH_STRICT_PARSING = True
```

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ben Caller from Doyensec.
- The fix was implemented in pull request #182, which introduced the use of `pyparsing` for parsing authentication headers.
- The commit `bd9ee252c8f099608019709e22c0d705e98d26bc` contains the changes addressing this vulnerability.
- The security advisory for this vulnerability is GHSA-93xj-8mrv-444m.
