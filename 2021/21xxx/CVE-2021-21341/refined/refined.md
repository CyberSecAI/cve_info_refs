{
  "CVE-2021-21341": {
    "Description": "The processed stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects. XStream creates therefore new instances based on these type information. An attacker can manipulate the processed input stream and replace or inject a manipulated ByteArrayInputStream (or derived class), that can cause an endless loop resulting in a denial of service.",
    "Root cause": "Manipulation of the processed input stream to inject a malicious ByteArrayInputStream (or derived class).",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled resource consumption",
       "Deserialization of untrusted data"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can allocate 100% CPU time on the target system, resulting in a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Manipulating the processed input stream."
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the input stream that is processed by XStream."
  }
