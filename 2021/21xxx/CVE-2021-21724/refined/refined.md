- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of memory release in certain scenarios.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory leak vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A local attacker can cause memory leak and abnormal service by repeatedly attenuating the optical signal.
- **Attack vectors:** Local attacker with device permissions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access to the device with appropriate permissions.
