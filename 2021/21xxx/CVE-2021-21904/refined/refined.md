- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `setenv` command in Garrett iC Module CMA does not sanitize the user-supplied `key` parameter, allowing directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22). The `setEnv` function concatenates a hardcoded path `/ltrx_user/env/` with the user-provided `key` without any validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary file overwrite, leading to the potential for arbitrary code execution as root user.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted `setenv` command to the authenticated CLI interface of the device, specifically providing a `key` containing directory traversal sequences such as `../`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to the CLI interface, which is typically accessed through a secondary GUI client called "CMA Connect" over TCP port 6877.
