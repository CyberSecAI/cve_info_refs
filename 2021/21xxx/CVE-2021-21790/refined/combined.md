# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2021-1255

## IOBit Advanced SystemCare Ultimate Privileged I/O Read vulnerabilities

##### July 7, 2021

##### CVE Number

CVE-2021-21790, CVE-2021-21791, CVE-2021-21792

### Summary

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the the way IOBit Advanced SystemCare Ultimate 14.2.0.220 driver handles Privileged I/O read requests. A specially crafted I/O request packet (IRP) can lead to privileged reads in the context of a driver which can result in sensitive information disclosure from the kernel. A local attacker can craft a malicious IRP to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

IOBit Advanced SystemCare Ultimate 14.2.0.220

### Product URLs

<https://www.iobit.com/>

### CVSSv3 Score

6.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CWE

CWE-782 - Exposed IOCTL with Insufficient Access Control

### Details

IOBit Advanced SystemCare Ultimate provides a solution for keeping track of running services, processes that are using a large amount of memory, software updates, and the ability to update drivers to latest versions.

Advanced SystemCare also provides a monitoring driver to help faciltate its tasks. This driver creates `\Device\IOBIT_WinRing0_1_3_0` which is readable and writable to everyone. The driver also provides a callback for handling `IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL` requests to the driver.

The driver used in this analysis is below:

Monitor\_win10\_x64.sys
e4a7da2cf59a4a21fc42b611df1d59cae75051925a7ddf42bf216cc1a026eadb

#### CVE-2021-21790 - Exposed IN byte

During IOCTL `0x9c4060cc`, the first `int` passed in the input buffer is the device port to read from via the `IN` instruction. The `IN` instruction can read one byte from the given I/O device, potentially leaking sensitive device data to unprivileged users.

```
Monitor_win10_x64.sys+0x11189

first_u32 = *(_DWORD *)input_buffer;
switch ( ioctl )
{
case 0x9C4060CC:
  out_byte = __inbyte(first_u32);
  *(_BYTE *)input_buffer = out_byte;
  goto LABEL_28;

```
#### CVE-2021-21791 - Exposed IN word

During IOCTL `0x9c4060d0`, the first `int` passed in the input buffer is the device port to read from via the `IN` instruction. The `IN` instruction can read two bytes from the given I/O device, potentially leaking sensitive device data to unprivileged users.

```
Monitor_win10_x64.sys+0x11189

first_u32 = *(_DWORD *)input_buffer;
switch ( ioctl )
{
...
        case 0x9C4060D0:
          out_word = __inword(first_u32);
          *(_WORD *)input_buffer = out_word;
          goto LABEL_28;

```
#### CVE-2021-21792 - Exposed IN dword

During IOCTL `0x9c4060d4`, the first `int` passed in the input buffer is the device port to read from via the `IN` instruction. The `IN` instruction can read four bytes from the given I/O device, potentially leaking sensitive device data to unprivileged users.

```
Monitor_win10_x64.sys+0x11189

first_u32 = *(_DWORD *)input_buffer;
switch ( ioctl )
{
...
        case 0x9C4060D4:
          out_dword = __indword(first_u32);
          *(_DWORD *)input_buffer = out_dword;
LABEL_28:
          *(_DWORD *)iostatus_info = v8;
          goto LABEL_64;

```
#### Exploit Proof of Concept

In combination with the exposed `OUT` instruction, an unprivileged user can access PCI devices on the system.

```
Opening Device
File Handle: 0xa0
Dumping PCI devices
Device: 0x1237 Vendor: 0x8086
Device: 0x7000 Vendor: 0x8086
Device: 0x100e Vendor: 0x80ee
Device: 0x2668 Vendor: 0x8086
Device: 0x003f Vendor: 0x106b
Device: 0x7113 Vendor: 0x8086
Device: 0x2829 Vendor: 0x8086

```
