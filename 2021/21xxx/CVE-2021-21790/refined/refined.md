The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21790.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the IOBit Advanced SystemCare Ultimate driver improperly handling privileged I/O read requests via the `IN` instruction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The driver exposes IOCTLs (`0x9c4060cc`, `0x9c4060d0`, `0x9c4060d4`) that allow reading from arbitrary I/O ports.
- Insufficient access control on the exposed IOCTLs permits unprivileged users to send these requests.
- The `IN` instruction is used to read data from the specified I/O port.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Sensitive data from the kernel, including data from I/O devices, can be leaked to an unprivileged user.
- This vulnerability can allow an attacker to read the configuration of PCI devices, as demonstrated in the exploit PoC.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the local system where the vulnerable driver is installed.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges.
