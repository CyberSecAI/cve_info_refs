- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows an attacker to access the CLI through brute force attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation grants the attacker access to the CLI. The confidentiality of the device is affected, as the attacker has access to information they shouldn't have.
- **Attack vectors**: Brute force attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the device, as the attack vector is local (AV:L) according to the CVSS score.
