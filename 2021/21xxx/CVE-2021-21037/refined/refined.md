- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Path Traversal
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path Traversal vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution
- **Attack vectors:** The document doesn't provide specific attack vectors, but path traversal vulnerabilities are typically exploited by manipulating file paths to access or modify files outside of the intended directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The document does not specify the required attacker capabilities or position beyond that an attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious file that would be opened by the vulnerable software.
