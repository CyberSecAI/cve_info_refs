Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21312:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the "Web Link" field within the document upload function. This allows a malicious user to inject JavaScript code into the database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application stores unsanitized user input (JavaScript payload) in the database, which is later executed by the browser of other users.
- Improper Input Sanitization: The application does not properly sanitize the "Web Link" field when adding/uploading a document.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The injected JavaScript code can be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the document summary page and click on the "Web Link".
- This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, or defacement of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must have the right to upload documents to the system.
- The attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript payload within the "Web Link" field when adding a new document using the "/front/document.form.php" endpoint or the path Home > Management > Documents > Add.
- The injected payload is stored in the database.
- When another user clicks on the "Web Link" associated with the document the payload executes in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account with sufficient privileges to upload documents.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the document upload function.
