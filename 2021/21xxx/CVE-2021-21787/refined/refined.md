The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21787.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control in the IOBit Advanced SystemCare Ultimate driver when handling privileged I/O write requests. Specifically, the driver exposes IOCTLs that allow writing to arbitrary I/O ports using the `OUT` instruction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Exposed IOCTLs:** The driver exposes IOCTLs (`0x9c40a0d8`, `0x9c40a0dc`, `0x9c40a0e0`) that allow writing to arbitrary I/O ports using the `OUT` instruction.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The driver does not properly restrict access to these IOCTLs, allowing unprivileged users to send crafted I/O request packets (IRPs) to trigger the vulnerability.
- The device `\Device\IOBIT_WinRing0_1_3_0` created by the driver is readable and writable by everyone.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can send a malicious IRP to the driver, causing it to write arbitrary values to I/O ports. By controlling the value and target port, the attacker can gain elevated privileges.
- **Access to PCI devices:** In combination with exposed `IN` instructions, an unprivileged user can access PCI devices on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** A local attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable driver.
- **Malicious IRP:** The attacker sends a crafted I/O request packet (IRP) to the driver, specifying the target I/O port and the data to write.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
- **Ability to send IOCTLs:** The attacker needs the ability to send IOCTL requests to the driver.
