Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-21181:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to a side-channel information leakage in the autofill component of the Chromium browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Side-channel information leakage: This refers to a vulnerability where an attacker can gain sensitive information by observing side effects of a system's operation, rather than directly accessing the data. In this case, the autofill mechanism leaks information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The vulnerability could allow an attacker to potentially gain access to sensitive information handled by the autofill feature.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is within the autofill component, meaning an attacker would need to interact with a website or a webpage that utilizes the autofill functionality within the browser to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with a webpage that triggers the autofill functionality. This could potentially be achieved by:
    *   Crafting a malicious website.
    *   Compromising a legitimate website and injecting malicious code.
    *   Tricking a user into interacting with a malicious page.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is described as a "side-channel information leak," which suggests the attacker may not directly obtain the data, but rather infer it through observed behavior.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in Chromium version 89.0.4389.72 and later.
*   The issue was reported by Xu Lin, Panagiotis Ilias, and Jason Polakis from the University of Illinois at Chicago.
*   This vulnerability is classified as "Medium" severity.
