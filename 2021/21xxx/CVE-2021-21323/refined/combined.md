<https://hackerone.com/reports/1077022>

~~related: [#4257](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/4257). it appears this was a known issue at least in the muon days. unclear if it was ever fixed in brave-core.~~

UPDATE: cause was cname adblocking, so this is a regression, not an earlier issue.

Resolves [brave/brave-browser#13527](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/13527)

This PR

Disable CNAME adblock for Tor to prevent it from sending DoH or standard DNS query which will not be routed through Tor

~~1. Fixes DoH requests should respect proxy config, matching the behavior as Firefox, so that DoH requests will route through Tor

2. Enforce DoH for DNS queries sent by CNAME adblock because users can turn DoH off and we currently don't have a way to route insecure DNS lookup through Tor(proxy config). We can consider implementing `Proxy DNS when using SOCKS v5`(network.proxy.socks\_remote\_dns) that Firefox has so we don't have to enforce DoH for this

3. Skip CNAME adblock DNS lookup if DoH mode is not secure or DoH server list is empty~~

## Submitter Checklist:

## Test Plan:

### DoH off

1. Follow the section `Using the (Pre)-Master-Secret` to setup `SSLKEYLOGFILE`

   <https://wiki.wireshark.org/TLS>
2. After Wireshark is capturing traffic, use the `dns` filter
3. Launch Brave
4. Go to brave://settings/security and turn off `Use secure DNS`
5. Open Tor window
6. Navigate to <https://tools.ietf.org/>
7. After site loaded, stop Wireshark capturing
8. There shouldn't be any DNS query or DoH query for `tools.ietf.org`

### DoH enabled

1. Follow the section `Using the (Pre)-Master-Secret` to setup `SSLKEYLOGFILE`

   <https://wiki.wireshark.org/TLS>
2. After Wireshark is capturing traffic, use the `dns` filter
3. Launch Brave
4. Go to brave://settings/security and make sure `Use secure DNS` is on and use custom Cloudflare resolver
5. Open Tor window
6. Navigate to <https://tools.ietf.org/>
7. After site loaded, stop Wireshark capturing
8. There shouldn't be any DNS query or DoH query for `tools.ietf.org`

`ResolveHostParameters::secure_dns_mode_override` for `SECURE` mode is useless without specifying doh\_server.

So we have to do it through `DnsConfigOverrides`

Just a heads up about [brave/brave-browser#13414](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/13414) - we should be able to remove most of this machinery once we rebase onto CR89, so I'd recommend keeping the fixes here as minimal as possible!

It seems like we should be setting this stuff when the Tor connection is created because presumably we need to always use it? Not just for this?

Normally, when we are in Tor window, we don't need to send ANY dns queries. We route all the HTTP/HTTPS traffic to tor proxy without knowing the IP, that means we just send hostname to proxy and the Tor exit node will do the resolving.

this is great but i don't think we should enable DoH for users who haven't picked a DoH provider, because IIUC they need to consent to the provider's terms of service. for users who haven't picked a DoH provider, can we just disable cname adblocking for them in Tor mode?

I think you can avoid this patch by defining `LOAD_BYPASS_PROXY` as `LOAD_DISABLE_CACHE`. If that doesn't work for some reason you should use a define/chromium\_src override after the original call instead of changing it to minimize the patch

actually I think this is a bad name because it makes it sound like it should be bypassing Tor and that's exactly the opposite of what we are doing. Maybe something like DisableInsecureRequestsOverTor

I really don't think we should do this for all requests. I checked git history around this code ([https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1843334/10/net/dns/dns\_transaction.cc](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/%2B/1843334/10/net/dns/dns_transaction.cc)), and the authors say LOAD\_BYPASS\_PROXY is here to prevent deadlocks.

So we should either try upstreaming this or limit to tor-related requests

yea, I actually can't really imagine why we'd ever want to bypass the proxy for DoH requests. That seems like it would actually prevent requests from working at all if the proxy was required for access and non-proxy requests are blocked by firewall

| per discussion on slack with [@bridiver](https://github.com/bridiver) and [@iefremov](https://github.com/iefremov), we came to a conclusion that disabling CNAME adblock for Tor would be best option now. Considering in order to make DoH route through Tor, we need to remove `LOAD_BYPASS_PROXY` for dns transaction but it might introduce dns and proxy code looping when we need to resolve proxy name. see (<https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/chromium.org/g/net-dev/c/GI4E9ERwPgw>) So if we want to route DoH through Tor, we need fine grained solution for it and also need a bigger discussion about this with privacy and security |

This is going to disable adblocker in tor windows. What we need to do here is an adblocking pass without CNAME resolving, e.g. we can directly call `ShouldBlockAdWithOptionalCname` with empty CNAME

# Regression in DNS leakage from Tor windows

High

[diracdeltas](/diracdeltas)
published
GHSA-mqjf-9x5g-2rv6
Feb 20, 2021

## Package

Brave Browser Desktop

## Affected versions

1.17.73-1.20.103

## Patched versions

1.20.108

## Description

### Impact

The CNAME adblocking feature added in Brave 1.17.73 accidentally initiated DNS requests that bypassed the Brave Tor proxy. Users with adblocking enabled would leak DNS requests from Tor windows to their DNS provider. (DNS requests that were not initiated by CNAME adblocking would go through Tor as expected.)

### Patches

1.20.108

### References

[#13527](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/13527)

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at security@brave.com. If you would like to report a security issue, please open one at <https://hackerone.com/brave>.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-21323

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
