Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21323:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability was a regression introduced by the CNAME adblocking feature in Brave browser. This feature inadvertently initiated DNS requests that bypassed the Tor proxy when a user had adblocking enabled within a Tor window.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DNS Leakage:** The primary vulnerability was a DNS leak when using Tor. DNS queries, meant to be routed through the Tor network, were instead being sent to the user's regular DNS provider. This was due to the CNAME adblocking feature's DNS resolution process not respecting the Tor proxy settings.
- **Improper Handling of DNS Resolution within Tor:** Specifically, the CNAME adblocking logic was making DNS queries outside of the Tor proxy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privacy Violation:** The most significant impact was a privacy breach for users relying on Tor for anonymity. The DNS leak exposed the user's browsing activity to their DNS provider, deanonymizing their Tor browsing.
- **Circumvention of Tor's Purpose:**  The vulnerability undermined the fundamental purpose of using Tor, which is to obfuscate the user's network traffic and location.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Enabled CNAME Adblocking:** The attack vector was automatic, triggered by the user having CNAME adblocking enabled within the Brave browser's Tor windows.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No direct attacker interaction required.** The vulnerability was triggered automatically based on a user's configuration (using Tor with CNAME adblocking enabled). There was no need for an active attacker to exploit it beyond the user visiting a website which triggered the CNAME lookup.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Brave Browser Desktop versions 1.17.73 to 1.20.103.
- It was fixed in version 1.20.108.
- The fix involved disabling CNAME adblocking for Tor, after initial attempts to route DoH through Tor proved problematic.
- The vulnerability was reported through HackerOne and tracked as issue #13527 on the Brave browser's GitHub repository.
- The issue was addressed in `brave-core` pull request #7769.
