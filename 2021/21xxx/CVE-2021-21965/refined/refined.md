The provided content is a vulnerability report from Talos Intelligence detailing two denial-of-service vulnerabilities, one of which is CVE-2021-21965.

**CVE-2021-21965**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability lies in the unauthenticated SeaMAX Ethernet API which is used for device configuration on UDP port 30718. The API allows for a reboot request.
*   **Weakness:** The SeaMAX Ethernet API does not require authentication, allowing any attacker with network access to send commands. The API's `HandleWriteSetupRecord3` function can be triggered to reboot the device if the first byte of the request is set to zero.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can repeatedly send a specific crafted packet to trigger a device reboot, effectively causing a denial of service. The device becomes unusable until it restarts. The attacker could also make breaking changes to the deviceâ€™s network configuration.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a specially crafted UDP packet to port 30718 of the vulnerable device.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs network access to the target device. No authentication is required.

**Technical Details:**
* The SeaMAX Ethernet API is exposed on UDP port 30718.
*   A request must be at least 4 bytes long, the 0th and 2nd bytes must be null, and the 3rd byte must be one of {0xC0, 0xC3, 0xE0, 0xE3}.
*   The `HandleWriteSetupRecord3` function is called when the 3rd byte is `0xC3`.
*   If the first byte of the request is zero, the function calls `Reboot()`.
*   The provided proof-of-concept uses a request `b'\x00\x00\x00\xC3'` to trigger a reboot.
