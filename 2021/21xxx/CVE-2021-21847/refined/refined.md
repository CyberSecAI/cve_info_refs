Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-21847:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content directly mentions "CVE-2021-21847" as one of the vulnerabilities addressed in the report.
*   It's described as part of a group of "multiple multiplication integer overflow vulnerabilities" in the "MPEG-4 decoding functionality" of the GPAC library.
*   The report is titled "GPAC Project on Advanced Content library MPEG-4 Decoding multiple multiplication integer overflow vulnerabilities" and lists CVE-2021-21847.
   Therefore the content relates to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an integer overflow during the parsing of an MPEG-4 container. Specifically, this overflow occurs in the `stts_box_read` function when processing an atom using the "stts" FOURCC code.
*   A 32-bit integer representing the number of entries is read from the atom.
*   This value is then multiplied by the size of the `GF_SttsEntry` structure which can lead to an integer overflow on 32-bit platforms, which results in a heap buffer with a smaller size being allocated.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The multiplication of the number of entries and the structure size overflows, leading to an undersized buffer allocation.
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:**  When the library reads data into the undersized buffer, it writes outside the bounds of the allocated memory.
*   **Insufficient Size Checks**:  The library performs checks on the number of entries against the file size, but these checks are insufficient because they are done using 64-bit sizes, whereas the count is read as a 32-bit integer and used in a multiplication.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:**  The heap-based buffer overflow corrupts memory on the heap.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The report indicates that memory corruption "can result in code execution under the context of the library."
*   **Denial of Service:** The Debian security advisory mentions "denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code" as potential consequences.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **MPEG-4 Input:** A specially crafted MPEG-4 file with a malicious "stts" atom can trigger the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** An attacker would need to convince a user to open the malicious file using software that relies on the vulnerable GPAC library.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious MPEG-4 file with a specific structure for the 'stts' atom which results in an integer overflow in the calculations done when processing the atom.
*   The attacker needs to convince a user to open this crafted video file.

**7. Additional Technical Details**
The `stts_box_read` function reads a 32-bit integer for the number of entries.  It then multiplies this value with the size of the `GF_SttsEntry` structure to calculate the buffer size.  On 32-bit platforms the multiplication can overflow and the resulting truncated value is used to allocate a smaller heap buffer. The subsequent read into this undersized buffer leads to the heap buffer overflow.

**In Summary:**

CVE-2021-21847 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability caused by an integer overflow when parsing the "stts" atom in an MPEG-4 container.  An attacker can create a malicous file and trigger this vulnerability by convincing the user to open this file on a machine using the GPAC library. This could lead to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.
