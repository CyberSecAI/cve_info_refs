The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21912.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is incorrect default permissions assigned to the "C:\R-SeeNet" directory during the installation of Advantech R-SeeNet. Specifically, the "Authenticated Users" group is granted "Full/Change" privileges over the "Apache2.2" service binary file located within the installation directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a privilege escalation issue stemming from the overly permissive file permissions on the "Apache2.2" service executable ("httpd.exe"). The "Authenticated Users" group having "Full/Change" access allows any authenticated user on the system to replace this binary with a malicious file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to escalate their privileges to NT SYSTEM authority. This is because the "Apache2.2" service executes with NT SYSTEM privileges. By replacing the legitimate executable with a malicious one, the attacker can execute arbitrary code with the highest level of privileges on the system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have access to the system, and an authenticated user account with the ability to write/modify files in "C:\R-SeeNet\apache\bin\" to replace the "httpd.exe" binary.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system where Advantech R-SeeNet is installed. The attacker must have write/change access to the vulnerable directory to replace the "httpd.exe" binary.
