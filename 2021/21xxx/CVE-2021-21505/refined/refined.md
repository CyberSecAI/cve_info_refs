The provided content is a Dell security advisory related to CVE-2021-21505.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an undocumented default iDRAC (Integrated Dell Remote Access Controller) account present in certain versions of Dell Integrated System for Microsoft Azure Stack Hub. This account has default credentials that, if known by an attacker, could allow unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Undocumented default iDRAC account with known default credentials.
- The account provides root level access when compromised.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote, unauthenticated attacker with knowledge of the default credentials can log in to the system and gain root privileges, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote access over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have network access to the iDRAC interface of the affected system.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the default credentials for the undocumented iDRAC account.

**Affected Products:**
Dell Integrated System for Microsoft Azure Stack Hub, versions 1906 to 2011.

**Resolution:**
The advisory recommends upgrading to version 2102 or later where the default account is disabled. For versions prior to 2102 the advisory recommends disabling the default account following the best practices as described in the Dell Integrated System for Microsoft Azure Stack Hub Patch and Update Installation Guide.
