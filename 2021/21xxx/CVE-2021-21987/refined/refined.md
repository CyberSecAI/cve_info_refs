- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds read in the Cortado ThinPrint component, specifically within the TTC header parser.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read vulnerability, triggered by crafted data in a font file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Information disclosure from the TPView process, potentially leading to further privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution with other vulnerabilities.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - Local attackers with the ability to execute low-privileged code on the guest system can exploit the vulnerability.
  - A malicious actor with access to a virtual machine or remote desktop may be able to exploit these issues.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system.
  - The attacker needs access to a virtual machine or remote desktop.
  - Virtual printing needs to be enabled, although this is not enabled by default on Workstation but is on by default on Horizon Client for Windows.
