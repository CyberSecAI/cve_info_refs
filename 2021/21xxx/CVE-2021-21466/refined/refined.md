  "CVE-2021-21466": {
    "root cause": "The vulnerable function `RSDRI_DF_TEXT_READ` makes use of the `INSERT REPORT` instruction by providing source code that is created dynamically using untrusted user input.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "ABAP code injection",
      "Lack of input validation",
      "Lack of output sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can embed arbitrary code into the ABAP Repository. Successful exploitation leads to full system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation via the RFC protocol"
    ],
