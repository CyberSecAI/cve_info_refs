- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled Search Path Element
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application searches for resources in an uncontrolled path, allowing a malicious actor to place a crafted file in a location that will be loaded by the application.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Privilege escalation in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor must be able to place a crafted file in a location searched by the application before it searches the correct location for the resource.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have write access to the location where the application is searching for the resource.
