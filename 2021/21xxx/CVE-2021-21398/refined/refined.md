Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21398:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper use of the `DataColumn` Grid class within the PrestaShop e-commerce platform. Specifically, it seems that data was not properly sanitized when being rendered by this class in the user interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is a stored XSS vulnerability. This means that an attacker can inject malicious HTML code that gets stored within the application's database or file system, and is then rendered later by the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **HTML Injection:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML code. This injected code can then be executed in the context of other users' browsers who view the affected data in the PrestaShop back office.
- **Malicious actions:** An attacker could leverage this to perform various actions such as stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Data Input:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious HTML through the `DataColumn` Grid class, likely by manipulating data that is displayed via the grid.
- **Back Office:** The vulnerability seems to primarily affect the back-office interface, which means an attacker would need to have some level of access, whether directly or through a compromised account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **PrestaShop Access:** The attacker must have some level of access to the PrestaShop back-office to inject the malicious payload via the vulnerable data input.
- **Understanding of Grid Data:** The attacker needs an understanding of how grid data and the `DataColumn` class is handled to craft an effective payload.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves changes to `src/Core/Grid/Column/Type/Currency/NameColumn.php`, `src/Core/Grid/Definition/Factory/CurrencyGridDefinitionFactory.php`, `src/PrestaShopBundle/Resources/views/Admin/Common/Grid/Columns/Content/currency_name.html.twig` and `src/PrestaShopBundle/Resources/views/Admin/Common/Grid/Columns/Content/data.html.twig` indicating a shift from rendering potentially unsafe data to using a dedicated column for currency names. The changes also show the addition of logic to handle unofficial and edited currency names in a safe way.
- The vulnerability is specific to versions of PrestaShop prior to 1.7.7.3
- The provided content also references a fix for this issue using commit `aaaba81`.
