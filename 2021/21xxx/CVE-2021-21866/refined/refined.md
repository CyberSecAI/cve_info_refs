Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21866:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the unsafe deserialization of untrusted data using `BinaryFormatter.Deserialize` within the `ProfileData` property of the `ProfileInformation` class in the CODESYS Development System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsafe Deserialization:** The application uses `BinaryFormatter.Deserialize` on data from a file, which is inherently unsafe when dealing with untrusted input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects into a file.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate the data being deserialized, allowing malicious objects to be instantiated which can then be used to execute code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary command execution on the system where the CODESYS Development System is running.
- **Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure:** According to the vendor advisory, the vulnerability can also lead to denial of service or information disclosure, along with remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Project Files:** An attacker can embed a malicious profile.auxiliary file within a CODESYS project file or project template. When a user opens this malicious project, the vulnerable deserialization is triggered.
- **Malicious Packages:** Installing malicious packages via the CODESYS package manager can be another avenue to introduce malicious files.
- **Malicious SVN repositories**: When using CODESYS SVN, accessing an SVN repository with malicious CODESYS project artifacts can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to create a malicious project file:** An attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted project file containing the malicious profile.auxiliary file.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user into opening the malicious project file or install a malicious package. For the SVN case, a user needs to connect to a malicious repository.
- **Network Access (for SVN attack):** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious SVN server or compromise an existing one to host malicious project artifacts.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in CODESYS Development System versions 3.5.16 and 3.5.17.
- The vulnerability is fixed in CODESYS Development System V3.5.17.10 and later, CODESYS Installer V1.3.0, and CODESYS SVN V4.4.0.0
- The vulnerability is rated as high severity with a CVSS v3.0 base score of 8.8 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
- Publicly available Proof-of-Concepts (POCs) exist for this vulnerability.
