Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-21069

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of helper clients within the Adobe privileged helper tool. This means the tool doesn't adequately verify the identity or legitimacy of the clients it interacts with.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Privilege Management:** The core issue is that the privileged helper tool doesn't correctly manage the privileges of its clients.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** Specifically, the lack of proper validation of the helper clients.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to elevate their privileges to root.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** With root privileges, the attacker can then execute arbitrary code on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to have local access to the target machine.
*   **Low-Privileged Code Execution:** The attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the system.
*   **Exploitation of Helper Tool:** The attacker then leverages the vulnerability in the Adobe privileged helper tool by interacting with it as a malicious client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have a foothold on the target system, such as through malware or prior compromise.
*   **Low-Privileged Code Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to run code on the target machine, even if it's with limited privileges.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Helper Tool:** The attacker needs to be aware of the specific weakness in the Adobe helper tool.

**Additional Details**
*   The vulnerability affects Adobe Creative Cloud on macOS.
*   Adobe has released an update to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Critical".
*   The affected versions are Creative Cloud Desktop Application 5.3 and earlier
*   The vulnerability was reported by "rookuu" working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
*   The CVSS score is 7.8, with a vector of AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
