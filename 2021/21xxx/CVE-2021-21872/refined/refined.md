- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application uses unsanitized user-supplied input from the `protocol` HTTP parameter to construct a `traceroute` command executed via a system call.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS Command Injection (CWE-78). The `protocol` parameter, intended to be `udp | tcp | icmp`, is not validated, allowing injection of arbitrary commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary command execution with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/` endpoint, including a malicious `protocol` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the PremierWave 2050 Web Manager interface to access the vulnerable functionality.
