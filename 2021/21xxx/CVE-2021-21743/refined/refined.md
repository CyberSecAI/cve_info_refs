Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-21743:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The ZTE MF971R product suffers from a CRLF injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CRLF Injection:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of carriage return and line feed characters in HTTP requests, allowing an attacker to inject these characters into the HTTP response header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **HTTP Response Header Modification:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to modify the HTTP response header information. This could lead to various attacks like:
    *   **HTTP Response Splitting:** This attack can allow an attacker to inject malicious content into the response, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) or other attacks by manipulating the user's browser.
    *   **Cache Poisoning:** An attacker could manipulate the response header in a way that would cause the injected response to be cached.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable device over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the affected ZTE MF971R device.
*   **Crafted HTTP Request:** The attacker needs to be capable of crafting a malicious HTTP request containing CRLF injection payloads.
