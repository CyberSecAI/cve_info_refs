{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `soap_decode` function within the gSOAP library when parsing URI parameters from a crafted SOAP request. The function uses an unsigned integer type (`size_t`) for buffer size calculations, causing a wrap-around to a large number when negative values are introduced due to a calculation error. This bypasses the intended size checks leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server. Attackers can achieve this by sending a specially crafted SOAP request to the vulnerable service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network",
      "HTTP Request"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable server. No authentication or specific privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability."
