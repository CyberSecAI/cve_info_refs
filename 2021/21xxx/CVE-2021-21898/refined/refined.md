Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21898:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `dwgCompressor::decompress18()` function within the `libdxfrw` library. This function is responsible for decompressing data within DWG files, a common file format for CAD software. The decompression process is flawed, leading to an out-of-bounds write due to a lack of proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:**  The `decompress18` function copies data from a compressed buffer to an uncompressed buffer. The size of the uncompressed buffer (`dsize`) is determined from the file header, and the size of the compressed data `csize` is also derived from the file. However, the code does not validate that the amount of data read from the compressed buffer, based on the literal length and opcodes, is within the allocated space for the uncompressed buffer. Specifically, the `litLength18()` function can return an arbitrary length that, when used in a copy loop, leads to writing beyond the allocated buffer. The vulnerability is triggered at `bufD[rpos++] = bufC[pos++]` within the `decompress18` function. The vulnerability is further exacerbated by the fact that `decompSize` is not compared to `compSize` before decompression happens.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** The primary impact is the potential for arbitrary code execution. By crafting a malicious DWG file that triggers the out-of-bounds write, an attacker can potentially overwrite critical data or code in memory, leading to control over the program's execution. This could be achieved by carefully overwriting parts of the heap or stack memory with malicious code.
- **Denial of Service:** A simpler impact is a denial-of-service. The out-of-bounds write can cause a crash of the application due to memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious DWG file:** The attack vector is a specially crafted DWG file. When a vulnerable application (like LibreCAD) opens this file, the flawed decompression logic is triggered, leading to the out-of-bounds write.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **File creation/modification:**  The attacker needs the ability to create or modify DWG files.
- **Target interaction:** The attacker needs to entice a user of a vulnerable application to open the malicious DWG file. No special privileges are required for exploitation and it can be triggered remotely via user interaction

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists because the size of the compressed and uncompressed buffers is controlled by values in the file. The `litLength18()` function, used within the decompression routine, reads an arbitrary length, with no validation on if it overflows the size of the output buffer.
- The issue affects multiple versions of the DWG file format due to shared code handling.
- The fix involves re-basing to a new code home (upstream git), which presumably addresses the out-of-bounds write through improved bounds checking.
- Talos analysis confirms the vulnerability by reproducing the crash with a crafted input file.
