Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-21307:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a combination of issues in the Lucee Admin panel, including the ability to access ColdFusion (CFM) files directly without authentication.
*   Additionally, the Lucee server allows using protocols/schemes like `zip://` and `file://` in file system functions where user input is not properly validated.
*   The `imgProcess.cfm` and `admin.search.index.cfm` functions allowed bypassing the Web Application Firewall (WAF) by not triggering path traversal or other blocked actions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Unauthenticated access:** The Lucee Admin panel, when not properly secured, allows access to CFM files without authentication.
*   **Insecure file handling:** Lucee permits the use of protocols like `zip://` and `file://` in functions accepting file paths, leading to arbitrary file access and potential code execution if these protocols are utilized with untrusted input.
*   **WAF bypass:** The `imgProcess.cfm` function and potentially other functions, allowed bypassing the Web Application Firewall (WAF).
*   **File upload vulnerability**: The system allows uploading files with `.lex` extensions, which are zip archives and the contents of these files aren't checked.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the above weaknesses, an attacker can upload malicious code onto the server and achieve shell access, leading to complete control over the affected system.
*  **Arbitrary file write:** The vulnerability can be used to write arbitrary files to the server.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network access:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network if the Lucee Admin panel is exposed to the public internet.
*   **Chained exploit:** The attack requires chaining multiple vulnerabilities and techniques, including exploiting the lack of authentication for CFM files, insecure file handling, WAF bypass using `imgProcess.cfm`, uploading malicious .lex files, and leveraging `zip://` or `file://` protocol schemes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Knowledge of Lucee:** The attacker needs to be aware of the Lucee platform and its specific vulnerabilities, including how .lex files are processed.
*   **Network access:** The attacker must have network access to the Lucee server's admin panel.
*   **Exploitation expertise:** The attacker needs to be able to chain the different vulnerabilities together.

**Additional notes:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered through a bug bounty program, and a $50,000 reward was given.
*   The issue was fixed by restricting direct access to CFM files and updating the Lucee software.
*   The advisory recommends updating Lucee to versions 5.3.5.96, 5.3.6.68, or 5.3.7.47 and blocking access to the Lucee Administrator as workarounds.
*   Exploit code for this vulnerability has been submitted to Metasploit.
*   The vulnerability is referenced in a writeup titled "Apple-RCE.md."
