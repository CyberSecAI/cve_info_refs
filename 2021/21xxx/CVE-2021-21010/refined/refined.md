- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled search path element
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to an uncontrolled search path element. This means that the application loads libraries or other executable files from locations that are under the control of an attacker.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. An attacker could potentially gain full control of the affected system
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to place a malicious file in a location where the vulnerable application will search for its required files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have write access to a directory which is part of the search path used by the application.
