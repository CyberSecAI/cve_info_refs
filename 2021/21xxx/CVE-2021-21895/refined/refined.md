The content is related to CVE-2021-21895.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled HTTP parameters, specifically the `cwd` parameter, when constructing file paths for TFTP operations. This allows path traversal using primitives such as `../`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal (CWE-22) in the FsTFtp functionality of the Lantronix PremierWave 2050 Web Manager.
- Insufficient sanitization of the `cwd` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the device, including critical system files like `/etc/shadow` or SSH authorized keys.
- Attackers can potentially gain full control of the device by modifying system files and executables.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP requests with crafted `cwd` parameters in the POST data to the `/` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to be authenticated with the `filesystem` privilege.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Requires network access to the device.
- Requires valid credentials with the `filesystem` privilege.
- Ability to send HTTP POST requests with a specifically crafted `cwd` parameter.
- For file overwrite attacks, requires a TFTP server controlled by the attacker.
