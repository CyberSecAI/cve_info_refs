Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of two consecutive crafted answers to an INVITE message within the `pjmedia_sdp_neg_modify_local_offer2` function in `pjproject`. Specifically, a null pointer dereference occurs when processing an updated SDP answer after an initial SDP negotiation failure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The code attempts to use a potentially null pointer (`src`) in `pj_strdup` function, leading to a crash. This happens when a second 183 response is received after a failed initial SDP negotiation.
- **Improper State Management:** The logic for handling updated SDP offers after a failure in initial negotiation was flawed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability causes PJSIP to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This can disrupt communication services relying on PJSIP.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted SIP Messages:** An attacker sends a specially crafted INVITE message, followed by two 183 responses. The first 183 response causes the initial SDP negotiation to fail, and the second 183 response triggers the crash due to the null pointer dereference.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send SIP messages to a vulnerable PJSIP server or client. This typically involves being on the same network as the target or having access through a network that allows SIP communication.
- No specific privileges are required beyond the ability to send network packets.

**Technical Details:**
- The crash occurs in `pj_strdup` called from `pjmedia_sdp_neg_modify_local_offer2`,  specifically when the code tries to duplicate a string from `src` pointer which can be null after a failed initial SDP negotiation.
- The vulnerable code is in `pjmedia/src/pjmedia/sdp_neg.c` and the fix involves adding a check to avoid the null pointer dereference.
- The specific vulnerable function call stack is:

    ```
- The fix involves checking if there is an active local SDP and, if not, clone the local SDP, otherwise it will call the logic for modifying it.
   ```c
    if (!neg->active_local_sdp) {
        neg->initial_sdp_tmp = NULL;
        neg->initial_sdp = pjmedia_sdp_session_clone(pool, local);
        neg->neg_local_sdp = pjmedia_sdp_session_clone(pool, local);

        return PJ_SUCCESS;
    }
   ```

This information is more detailed than the official CVE description, which simply mentions a crash due to bad handling of crafted INVITE responses and consequent DoS.
