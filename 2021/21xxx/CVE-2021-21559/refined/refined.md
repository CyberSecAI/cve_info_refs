Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21559:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper certificate validation in the Dell EMC NetWorker Management Console client components. These components use SSL encrypted connections to communicate with the application server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Certificate Validation: The client fails to properly validate the SSL certificate of the server it connects to.
- This can allow a malicious user to act as a Man-in-the-Middle by using their own invalid or self signed certificate when establishing the encrypted connection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** An attacker can intercept and potentially tamper with the traffic between the NetWorker Management Console client and the application server by impersonating the server with a malicious certificate.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** Successful exploitation could lead to the attacker gaining access to sensitive data being transmitted, modifying data in transit, or disrupting the communication between the client and server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be in the same network collision domain as the NetWorker Management Console client.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
- **MitM:** The attacker intercepts communication between the client and server.
- The client connects via an SSL encrypted channel, which is the vector of the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same local network segment as the NetWorker Management Console client.
- **Interception Ability:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the server, often done with ARP poisoning or similar techniques.
- **Impersonation:** The attacker must be able to present a malicious SSL certificate to the client.
- **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need valid credentials to perform the attack.

**Affected Products:**
- Dell EMC NetWorker Management Console versions 18.x, 19.1.x, 19.2.x, 19.3.x, 19.4, and 19.4.0.1.
- The vulnerability does not affect NetWorker Servers, Storage Nodes, or Clients if the NetWorker Management Console is not installed.

**Mitigation:**
- Dell recommends updating to Dell EMC NetWorker 19.3.0.5, 19.4.0.2, or later.

**Additional Notes:**
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.1 (High) with a vector string of CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
- The vulnerability was reported by Piotr Madej and Lukasz Mikula of AFINE.
