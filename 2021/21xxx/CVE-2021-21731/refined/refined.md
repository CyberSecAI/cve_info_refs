- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The management page of a ZTE product does not fully verify whether the request comes from a trusted user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could submit a malicious request to the affected device to delete the data.
- **Attack vectors**: Malicious request submitted to the management page of the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to induce a victim to submit a crafted request. The CVSS score indicates the attack requires a user interaction (UI:R) and the attacker has to be on the same network (AV:A) and that the attack is of low complexity (AC:H).
