- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Git plugin did not sanitize Git SHA-1 checksum parameters in commit notifications when displaying them in the build cause.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are executed in the context of a user viewing the build cause page, leading to potential compromise of user sessions or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker submits a crafted commit notification to the `/git/notifyCommit` endpoint with malicious script in the SHA-1 checksum.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to submit commit notifications to the `/git/notifyCommit` endpoint.
