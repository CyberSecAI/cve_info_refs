- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `device_graph_page.php` script in Advantech R-SeeNet software does not sanitize user-supplied input received via the `graph`, `device_id`, and `is2sim` parameters, before embedding it into the HTML code. Specifically, the values of these parameters are directly inserted into the `src` attribute of an `<img>` tag within the HTML, without proper encoding or escaping.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to improper neutralization of input during web page generation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the web page, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the vulnerable parameters (`graph`, `device_id`, or `is2sim`). The attacker then needs to trick a victim into visiting the crafted URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious payload. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
