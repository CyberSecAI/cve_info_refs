Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-21571:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Dell UEFI BIOS HTTPS stack, used by the BIOSConnect and HTTPS Boot features, has an improper certificate validation vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper certificate validation in the HTTPS stack of Dell UEFI BIOS. This means the BIOS may not properly verify the authenticity of certificates, allowing for a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service.
- **Payload Tampering:** An attacker may be able to tamper with the payload (data being transferred) during the BIOSConnect or HTTPS Boot process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Person-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can intercept network traffic between the Dell system and the server it is connecting to.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic.
- **Compromised Network:** The attacker needs to compromise the user's network.
- **Valid Certificate:** The attacker must obtain a certificate that is trusted by one of the Dell UEFI BIOS HTTPS stack's built-in Certificate Authorities.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs a physically present user to initiate the BIOSConnect or HTTPS boot feature.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the Dell BIOSConnect and HTTPS Boot features.
- The BIOSConnect feature is used for updating BIOS and recovering the OS.
- The HTTPS Boot feature is used to boot from an HTTPS server.
- The document mentions that disabling Secure Boot may impact the severity of the vulnerability.
- The document also notes that the vulnerability was reported as part of a vulnerability chain, which has a higher cumulative score of 8.3 High.
- Mitigations include updating the BIOS and disabling BIOSConnect/HTTPS Boot feature in BIOS settings.
