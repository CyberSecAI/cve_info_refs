Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-21683:

**Root Cause:**

*   The file browser within Jenkins (for workspaces, archived artifacts, and `userContent/`) on Windows incorrectly interprets some file paths as absolute.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability is a path traversal issue. The improper handling of file paths allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read the contents of arbitrary files on the Jenkins server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered through the file browser functionality in Jenkins on Windows systems.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** Attackers need either:
    *   Overall/Read permission on the Windows Jenkins controller.
    *   Job/Workspace permission on Windows agents.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to interact with the Jenkins instance through its web interface.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability affects Jenkins versions 2.314 and earlier, and LTS versions 2.303.1 and earlier.
*   The fix is implemented in Jenkins 2.315 and LTS 2.303.2, which now refuse to serve files with paths that would be considered absolute.
