- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the improper use of prepared statements in conjunction with stored procedures and SQL concatenation. Specifically, variables used to build SQL queries are initially sanitized but lose their protection when invoked against the database because a final prepared statement is constructed using a concatenated string (`@sql`) without proper parameter binding.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of proper handling of user-controlled parameters in the `device_list` page. These parameters are used to construct SQL queries without adequate sanitization within a stored procedure, leading to SQL injection. The specific vulnerable parameters include:
    - `desc_filter`
    - `firm_filter`
    - `health_filter`
    - `loc_filter`
    - `mac_filter`
    - `prod_filter`
    - `sn_filter`
    - `stat_filter`
    - `name_filter`
    - `esn_filter`
    - `imei_filter`
    - `host_alt_filter2`
    - `health_alt_filter`
    - `host_alt_filter`
-  **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data modification, or data exfiltration.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vectors are HTTP GET requests to the `device_list` page, with malicious payloads injected into vulnerable parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application to exploit these vulnerabilities. Exploitation can also be done via Cross-Site Request Forgery.
