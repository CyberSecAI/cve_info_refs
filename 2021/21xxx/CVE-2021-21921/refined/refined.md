Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-21921:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper use of prepared statements in conjunction with stored procedures in the Advantech R-SeeNet application.
- SQL queries are built by concatenating sanitized variables and SQL code in stored procedures. Although the variables are sanitized initially using `mysqli_real_escape_string`, this protection is lost because the concatenated string is used to create a prepared statement from a variable (@sql) without specific parameter bindings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the way user-controlled input is incorporated into SQL queries within the stored procedures.
- The `name_filter` parameter is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject arbitrary SQL commands that could allow them to:
    - Extract sensitive data from the database.
    - Modify or delete data.
    - Potentially gain unauthorized access to the system or other resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Parameters:** The attack vector is through specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the `user_list` page, specifically manipulating the `name_filter` parameter.
- The vulnerability can be exploited via cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application, with either an administrative account or through CSRF.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is in the `user_list.php` file, where the `name_filter` GET parameter is processed:
  - The `name_filter` parameter is retrieved, URL decoded and stored in the `$_SESSION['name_filter']` variable
  - Later on, the value stored in `$_SESSION['name_filter']` is used to construct part of an SQL `LIKE` clause using `mysqli_real_escape_string`.
  - The constructed SQL query is concatenated into a string and executed using a stored procedure called `sp_GetUsersAll` or `sp_GetUsers`.
  - The stored procedure uses a prepared statement, where the constructed query is assigned to the `@sql` variable. Then, a prepared statement is created from this variable and executed. This approach is what makes it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Example Exploit (for `name_filter`):**
```
GET /r-seenet/index.php?page=user_list&username_filter=a&name_filter=aa%22%20AND%20(SELECT%209766%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))a)--%20a&surname_filter= HTTP/1.1
