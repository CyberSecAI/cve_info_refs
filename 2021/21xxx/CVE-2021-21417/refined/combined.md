`fluid_list_remove()` should receive the beginning of a list, so it can adjust the predecessor of the element to be removed. Otherwise, the element would remain in the list, which in this case led to a use-after-free afterwards.

| I must admit I don't understand why this fixes the bug. `*hz` is a pointer to the first element in the zone list. So at the start it's effectively identical to the new `start_of_zone_list`. And `*hz` only gets changed if we encounter a global zone that is not first in list. In this case, the global zone moved to be first in that list and `*hz` is updated accordingly. So doing a `fluid_list_remove` on `*hz` should have the same effect as on the new `start_of_zone_list` pointer, shouldn't it? |

| \*hz is a pointer to the first element in the zone list.  No, `hz` is a pointer to pointer. `*hz` is (usually) equal to `p2`. So, it would have been like putting `fluid_list_remove(p2, p2->data);` |

| Ah, of course! Hm... then I have a hard time understanding the purpose of `hz` in the first place, and when it gets updated. I guess I need more time going through this again. That code reads a little like it's been deliberately obfuscated :-) I once had the impression that I understand what's going on, but that was a long time ago... |

| The purpose of `hz` is not quite clear to me as well. It could be a leftover when they passed `hz` to a separate function that removed the zone:     [fluidsynth/fluidsynth/src/sfloader/fluid\_defsfont.c](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/blob/62e375c71c815ca12f859b8722db5dff12f0c897/fluidsynth/src/sfloader/fluid_defsfont.c#L2443)  Line 2443 in [62e375c](/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/commit/62e375c71c815ca12f859b8722db5dff12f0c897)   |  | sfont\_zone\_delete (sf, hz, (SFZone \*) (p2->data)); | | --- | --- |      The core logic around it already exists since "Initial Revision", so I'm a bit cautious to touch it. It would probably be a good idea to write a bunch of test cases, before changing it. |

| Looking into `load_pgen()` some more, I think the logic behind that `hz` pointer is completely broken... and not just in the place where this PR introduces a fix. It's purpose is to be able to move a global zones that is not the first zone in a preset to the beginning of the zone list. But as `*hz` points to the local `p2` variable (i.e. the current entry in the zone list), the `preset->zone` list is not updated correctly. |

| I don't see how the global zone relocation code will ever have run. As far as I understand it, the following check will always be false, because `*hz` and `p2` point to the same memory location:   [fluidsynth/src/sfloader/fluid\_sffile.c](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/blob/b8fb6c81e1ca27c0bba2f6a0168832214f91d497/src/sfloader/fluid_sffile.c#L1517)  Line 1517 in [b8fb6c8](/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/commit/b8fb6c81e1ca27c0bba2f6a0168832214f91d497)   |  | if(\*hz != p2) | | --- | --- |      And looking back through the history of this code, I arrive at the initial commit which has the same behaviour. So I guess we could either remove the relocation code altogether, or fix try to fix it. |

| It's purpose is to be able to move a global zones that is not the first zone in a preset to the beginning of the zone list.  Yes, I also had the feeling it has to do with moving around zones. I also don't see how `(*hz != p2)` can ever evaluate to true.  And looking back through the history of this code, I arrive at the initial commit which has the same behaviour  I arrived at iiwusynth: <https://cvs.savannah.nongnu.org/viewvc/iiwusynth/iiwusynth/src/iiwu_defsfont.c?revision=1.1&view=markup>  We could ask Peter, I'm sure he will remeber what he did 19 years ago :D  So I guess we could either remove the relocation code altogether, or fix try to fix it.  I think we should fix it. Ideally by creating test cases. But this will take time. I would prefer to merge this and release 2.1.8 afterwards (even if it's not perfectly correct). |

### **[derselbst](/derselbst)** commented [Mar 14, 2021](#issuecomment-798878782)

| Thanks for the detailed report. The problem here is that `fluid_list_remove(*hz, p2->data);` should receive the beginning of the list, so it can adjust `p2`s predecessor. Unfortunately, it receives `*hz`, which in this case points to `p2`, which in turn is the element about to be removed. Hence there is no chance to remove the item from the list.  The next time it would be accessed is in `fixup_igen`. This is where you get the `Invalid sample reference` error, which erroneously causes the whole soundfont to be dropped.  Looking at the code, I think we'll have a similar flaw when parsing the presets. I'll make a PR for that in a second and mention you, so you can test it with potentially other malformed fonts you have around. If you have no time to test, pls. let me know, because I wanted to release 2.1.8 today or tomorrow. |

| Hello, I wonder if it's also affecting v1.1.11? `static int load_pgen` definition exists in `src/sfloader/fluid_defsfont.c` there which is not way too different than what it is atm. Could somebody confirm if this bug/CVE also applies to v1.1.11?  Thanks! |

| CVE-2021-28421 was assigned for this.  [@ajakk](https://github.com/ajakk):  [GHSA-6fcq-pxhc-jxc9](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/security/advisories/GHSA-6fcq-pxhc-jxc9 "GHSA-6fcq-pxhc-jxc9") mentions CVE-2021-21417 but references [#808](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/issues/808). Is this a duplicate?  CVE-2021-21417 was assigned by GitHub, maybe automatically. |

| CVE-2021-21417 is the one I've originally filed via Github security advice. Which actually worked quite smooth, but unfortunately, the CVE stayed "reserved" even after the advice was published on Mar 31. But it seems like it was finally published a few days ago. No clue why it stayed reserved for so long. The best guess I have is that veritas501 hasn't accepted the credit for this CVE. Although according to GH documentation this shouldn't matter... weird. |
