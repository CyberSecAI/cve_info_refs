SECURITY-2204 / CVE-2021-21642
Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not configure its XML
parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers with the ability to define Maven configuration files
to have Jenkins parse a crafted configuration file that uses external
entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or
server-side request forgery.

SECURITY-2254 / CVE-2021-21643
Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not correctly perform
permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with global Job/Configure permission to enumerate
system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can
be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

SECURITY-2202 / CVE-2021-21644
Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not require POST
requests for an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery
(CSRF) vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to delete configuration files
corresponding to an attacker-specified ID.

SECURITY-2203 / CVE-2021-21645
Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not perform permission
checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate
configuration file IDs.

SECURITY-2311 / CVE-2021-21646
Templating Engine Plugin 2.1 and earlier does not protect its pipeline
configurations using Script Security Plugin.

This vulnerability allows attackers with Job/Configure permission to
execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

SECURITY-2309 / CVE-2021-21647
CloudBees CD Plugin 1.1.21 and earlier does not perform a permission check
in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Item/Read permission to schedule builds of
projects without having Item/Build permission.

# Jenkins Security Advisory 2021-04-21

This advisory announces vulnerabilities in the following Jenkins deliverables:

* [CloudBees CD
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/electricflow)
* [Config File Provider
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/config-file-provider)
* [Templating Engine
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/templating-engine)

## Descriptions

### XXE vulnerability in Config File Provider Plugin

**SECURITY-2204
/
CVE-2021-21642**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`config-file-provider`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/config-file-provider)**

**Description:**

Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers with the ability to define Maven configuration files to have Jenkins parse a crafted configuration file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.1 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

### Incorrect permission checks in Config File Provider Plugin allow enumerating credentials IDs

**SECURITY-2254
/
CVE-2021-21643**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`config-file-provider`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/config-file-provider)**

**Description:**

Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with global Job/Configure permission to enumerate system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of system-scoped credentials IDs in Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.1 requires Overall/Administer permission.

### CSRF vulnerability in Config File Provider Plugin allows deleting configuration files

**SECURITY-2202
/
CVE-2021-21644**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`config-file-provider`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/config-file-provider)**

**Description:**

Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not require POST requests for an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to delete configuration files corresponding to an attacker-specified ID.

This is due to an incomplete fix of [SECURITY-938](/security/advisory/2018-09-25/#SECURITY-938).

Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.1 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoint.

### Missing permission checks in Config File Provider Plugin allow enumerating configuration file IDs

**SECURITY-2203
/
CVE-2021-21645**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`config-file-provider`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/config-file-provider)**

**Description:**

Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate configuration file IDs.

An enumeration of configuration file IDs in Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.1 requires the appropriate permissions.

### Remote code execution vulnerability in Templating Engine Plugin

**SECURITY-2311
/
CVE-2021-21646**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`templating-engine`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/templating-engine)**

**Description:**

Templating Engine Plugin 2.1 and earlier does not protect its pipeline configurations using Script Security Plugin.

This vulnerability allows attackers with Job/Configure permission to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

Templating Engine Plugin 2.2 integrates with Script Security Plugin to protect its pipeline configurations.

### Missing permission check in CloudBees CD Plugin allows scheduling builds

**SECURITY-2309
/
CVE-2021-21647**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`electricflow`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/electricflow)**

**Description:**

CloudBees CD Plugin 1.1.21 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Item/Read permission to schedule builds of projects without having Item/Build permission.

CloudBees CD Plugin 1.1.22 requires Item/Build permission to schedule builds via its HTTP endpoint.

## Severity
