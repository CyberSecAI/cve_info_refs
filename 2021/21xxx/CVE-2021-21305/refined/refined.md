{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `manipulate!` method in `CarrierWave::RMagick` inappropriately uses `eval` on the provided options, allowing arbitrary code execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Code Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution (RCE) if an attacker can control the input to the `manipulate!` method's mutation options.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "By supplying crafted strings to the `:read` or `:write` options within the `manipulate!` method of `CarrierWave::RMagick`."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply untrusted input to the `manipulate!` method's mutation options (`:read`/`:write`).",
    "details": "The `manipulate!` method in `CarrierWave::RMagick` constructs a Ruby code string based on the provided options and then evaluates this string using `eval`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary Ruby code by crafting a malicious string within the `read` or `write` options. The vulnerability arises due to the lack of proper sanitization or validation of these options before they are used in the `eval` statement."
