- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-based buffer overflow in the `PlainTextUncompressor::UncompressItem` function of AT&T Labs' Xmill 0.7. The vulnerability occurs because the length parameter read from the compressed file is not validated against the destination buffer size during decompression, leading to a `memcpy` that can write past the allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow, lack of input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted XMI file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide a malicious XMI file to trigger the vulnerability. No special privileges or access are required beyond the ability to provide the input.
