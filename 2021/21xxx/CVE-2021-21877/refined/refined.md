The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21877.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command, specifically within the `tftp` command construction. The `host` parameter, sourced from an HTTP request, is directly injected into the command without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- OS Command Injection (CWE-78): The application constructs a command using user-controlled input (`host` parameter) without proper sanitization, allowing injection of arbitrary commands.
- Lack of input validation: The application fails to validate or sanitize the `host` parameter before using it in the system call.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges on the affected device.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through authenticated HTTP requests to the Web Manager FsTFtp functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated to the web interface of the Lantronix PremierWave 2050 device.
- The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP POST request with the vulnerable parameters.
- The attacker needs to have "filesystem" permissions.
