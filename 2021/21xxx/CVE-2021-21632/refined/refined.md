Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-21632:

**CVE-2021-21632**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The OWASP Dependency-Track Plugin does not perform permission checks on several HTTP endpoints. Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests, leading to a CSRF vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Missing permission check in HTTP endpoints.
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) due to the absence of POST request requirements.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs, capturing "Secret text" credentials stored in Jenkins.
    *   If no credentials ID is specified, the globally configured credential is used, and can also be captured.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker would need Overall/Read permissions to exploit the missing permission check.
    *   CSRF attacks can be executed by tricking a user with active session in Jenkins to send a crafted HTTP request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
    *   Knowledge of Jenkins instance URLs.
    *   Ability to induce user interaction (for CSRF).
    *  Ability to obtain credential IDs, if not leveraging globally configured credentials.
