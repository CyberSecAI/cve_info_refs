Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21235:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an infinite loop within the `Reader::read_from_container` function when processing a specially crafted PNG file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The code does not properly handle specific malformed PNG files.
- The `Reader::read_from_container` function lacks proper bounds checking or logic to prevent infinite loops.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by providing a malicious PNG file.
- The application processing the file would enter an infinite loop, potentially consuming excessive resources and becoming unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by supplying a crafted PNG file to the `Reader::read_from_container` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted PNG file to an application using the affected library (`kamadak-exif` version 0.5.2).

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix was implemented in version 0.5.3.
- The commit `f21df24616ea611c5d5d0e0e2f8042eb74d5ff48` addresses this issue by fixing the infinite loop when parsing PNG files. This commit modifies the `src/util.rs` file, specifically the `discard_exact` function within the `BufReadExt` trait.
- Applications not passing files with the PNG signature to `Reader::read_from_container` are not affected.
