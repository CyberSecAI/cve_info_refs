Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-21286:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way password hashes were handled in the AVideo platform.  Specifically, the issue was that password hashes (including `pass` and `recoverPass` hashes) were not being removed during certain queries, potentially exposing them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Exposure of sensitive password hashes.
- Lack of proper sanitization of queries, leading to the inclusion of password hashes in responses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious user could potentially gain administrative control of the AVideo platform.
- The vulnerability could have allowed unauthorized access and privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that malicious users could exploit the exposed password hashes through specific queries which were not sanitizing the response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- It is likely that an attacker would need to be a user of the AVideo platform.  It is unclear if they need to be an authenticated user or whether the vulnerability can be exploited without an account.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in AVideo versions prior to 10.1 and was patched in version 10.2.
*   The provided content does not specify the exact query or code location that was vulnerable.
*   The workarounds provided involved resetting the password via SSH, indicating that the vulnerability is most likely related to some query against the database.
*   The CVE description in the provided GitHub advisory states "All queries now remove the pass hash and the recoverPass hash", further elaborating that the queries were vulnerable for leaking the password hashes.
