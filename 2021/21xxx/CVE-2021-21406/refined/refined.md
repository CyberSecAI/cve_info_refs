- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the Setup Wizard when providing the Graphviz executable path. It is caused by insufficient validation of the provided path, which allows for command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (Graphviz executable path) before using it in a system call.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server by injecting them into the Graphviz path.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to be able to access the Setup Wizard interface to provide the malicious Graphviz path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have access to the application's Setup Wizard and be able to modify the Graphviz executable path setting.
