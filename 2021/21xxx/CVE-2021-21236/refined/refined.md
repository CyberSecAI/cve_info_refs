Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-21236

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of two regular expressions in the `cairosvg/colors.py` file that are susceptible to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The regular expressions used to parse `rgba` and `rgb` color values contained overlapping groups, specifically `[ \n\r\t]\*` , which could lead to catastrophic backtracking when processing long strings of spaces within the color definition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service):** The primary weakness is the use of vulnerable regular expressions that can cause excessive backtracking when processing specially crafted input. This can lead to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Overlapping capture groups:** The regexes had overlapping groups that allowed spaces to be matched in multiple repeating parts, causing backtracking when the input didn't match the expected format.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can provide a malicious SVG file that contains a long string of spaces within the `rgb()` or `rgba()` color definitions. When CairoSVG attempts to process this SVG, it gets stuck due to the ReDoS vulnerability and consumes excessive CPU resources for a prolonged period, effectively causing a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious SVG file:** The attacker provides a specially crafted SVG file containing a long string of whitespace characters within the `rgb()` or `rgba()` color definitions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious SVG file to be processed by CairoSVG. This could happen in various scenarios such as:
    - When processing user-uploaded SVG files
    - When processing SVGs from untrusted sources

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable regular expressions are:

```python
RGBA = re.compile(r'rgba\([ \n\r\t]\*(.+?)[ \n\r\t]\*\)')
RGB = re.compile(r'rgb\([ \n\r\t]\*(.+?)[ \n\r\t]\*\)')
```

The issue lies in the `[ \n\r\t]\*`  sections, which allows spaces, newlines, carriage returns, and tabs to be matched zero or more times. When a long string of these characters is provided *without* a closing parenthesis, the regex engine backtracks excessively, leading to exponential time complexity.

The provided example shows that a string with 3456 spaces will cause 100% CPU usage and hang the program. The complexity is cubic, therefore doubling the spaces increases the execution time by 8.

**Remediation:**

The vulnerability was addressed by modifying the regexes and using `strip()` on the capture groups to remove any leading/trailing whitespace. The fix included removing the `[ \n\r\t]\*` from the regex. The corrected regexes were not provided in the content, but the logic of the fix was.
