This document describes two vulnerabilities, CVE-2021-21965 and CVE-2021-21964. Only CVE-2021-21964 is relevant to this request.

**CVE-2021-21964**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists due to the lack of authentication on the Modbus interface of the Sealevel Systems, Inc. SeaConnect 370W device. Specifically, the device's Modbus server provides access to a "Reboot" function (function code 0x13) which can be triggered by an attacker without any authentication.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Improper Access Control:** The Modbus interface (TCP port 502) is accessible without any authentication.
    *   **Unprotected "Reboot" Function:** The device provides a Modbus function (0x13) that directly triggers a reboot without any authorization.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can render the device unusable by repeatedly sending Modbus requests with function code 0x13, causing the device to reboot continuously.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker with network access to the device on TCP port 502 can send the malicious Modbus requests.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs network connectivity to the device on TCP port 502 and needs to be able to send Modbus requests to the device.

**Technical Details:**
*   The Modbus request is dispatched to a function named `DispatchModbusRequest` at offset 0x121B4.
*   The reboot function is called when the Modbus function code 0x13 is received: `case 0x13: Reboot();  // noreturn`

**Proof of Concept:**
A Python script to exploit this vulnerability is provided which sends the following bytes to the device: `b'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x13'` via TCP socket on port 502, which will trigger the reboot.
