Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21857:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `txtc_box_read` function of the GPAC library, which handles the parsing of atoms with the "txtc" FOURCC code.
- The root cause is an integer overflow vulnerability due to unchecked addition when calculating buffer size for heap allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Integer Overflow:** The code adds 1 to the 64-bit size of the atom, truncates the result to 32-bits, and uses it for memory allocation. If the original 64-bit size is sufficiently large (e.g., `0xffffffff`), adding 1 and then truncating leads to a small (possibly zero-sized) allocation.
- **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow:** After the undersized memory allocation, the function uses the original, non-truncated size (which is much larger) to read data from the input stream into the undersized buffer. This results in a heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Missing Size Check:** The code does not check the size of the input before allocating memory, making it susceptible to maliciously crafted input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Corruption:** A heap-based buffer overflow occurs due to the integer overflow and subsequent write operation, leading to memory corruption.
- **Code Execution:** The memory corruption can potentially be leveraged by an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the application using the library. This can lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Maliciously Crafted MPEG-4 File:** An attacker can create a specially crafted MPEG-4 file containing a "txtc" atom with a large size.
- **User Interaction:** The user must open/process the malicious file using a vulnerable application that utilizes the GPAC library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Create Malicious File:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious MPEG-4 file with specific atom size and type.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a victim to open the malicious file.

**Technical Details:**

- The `txtc_box_read` function is vulnerable.
- The vulnerability occurs when allocating memory with `gf_malloc` using `((u32) ptr->size + 1)`, where `ptr->size` is a 64 bit value that is then truncated to a 32 bit integer. When `ptr->size` is equal to UINT_MAX, then adding 1 results in integer overflow and a zero sized buffer being allocated.
- The data is written to the buffer with `gf_bs_read_data(bs, ptr->config, (u32) ptr->size)`.
- The buffer overflow is triggered when the code attempts to null-terminate `ptr->config[ptr->size] = 0;` after reading data into the undersized buffer using the original size.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by convincing a user to open a malicious file.
- The provided crash information highlights the exact location of the heap-buffer-overflow and shows the sizes involved in the vulnerability.
