Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21619:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Claim Plugin does not properly escape the user display name before displaying it in claims.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the user display name is not sanitized, which allows the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser by controlling the display names of Jenkins users. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker can control the display name of a Jenkins user, either via the security realm or directly inside Jenkins. This control allows them to inject a malicious script into the display name. When that display name is shown in a claim, the malicious script is executed in the victim's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to control the display name of a Jenkins user. This can be achieved by having a Jenkins account where they can change their own display name or by having admin access to modify display names of other users. They must then cause the claim to be viewed.

**Additional Notes:**
The advisory mentions that everyone with a Jenkins account can change their own display name, highlighting the potential scope of this vulnerability.
