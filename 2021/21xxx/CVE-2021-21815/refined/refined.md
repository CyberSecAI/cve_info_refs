- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `HandleFileArg` function in AT&T Labs Xmill 0.7 uses `strcpy` to copy user-provided file paths into a fixed-size buffer on the stack without checking the length, leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow due to the use of `strcpy` without bounds checking.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Code execution. An attacker can overwrite parts of the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Command-line arguments. A malicious file path passed as a command-line argument can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the `xmill` utility with crafted command-line arguments on a Linux system.
