- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unsafe deserialization of user-provided data in the `data` query parameter of AJAX requests processed by the `BasePage` class. The application decodes a Base64-encoded string from the `data` parameter and deserializes it without proper validation or sanitization.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Unsafe deserialization of untrusted data.
    - Lack of input validation for the data parameter.
    - Use of Java serialization without proper safeguards.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE). The deserialized data can contain malicious payloads that execute arbitrary code on the server.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - Sending a POST request to any page of the application (excluding the login page) with a crafted `data` parameter containing a serialized malicious object.
    - The `data` parameter is encoded in Base64.
    - The vulnerability is triggered through the `AbstractPostAjaxBehavior` listener associated with the `BasePage`.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be authenticated to the application.
    - Ability to craft a malicious serialized Java object and encode it in Base64.
    - Must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target server.
