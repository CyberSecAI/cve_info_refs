The content is related to CVE-2021-21929.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user-supplied input in SQL queries within the Advantech R-SeeNet application. Specifically, the application uses a stored procedure along with SQL concatenation where variables used to build SQL query, despite being initially sanitized, lose that protection when invoked against the database. This occurs because a final prepared statement is taken from the @sql variable without specific parameter bindings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89): Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist in the ‘device_list’ page due to unsanitized user inputs being directly concatenated into SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data, modifying data, or disrupting service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the `device_list` page. Specifically, the `prod_filter` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application. The vulnerability can be triggered either by sending requests directly as an authenticated user or via a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack.
