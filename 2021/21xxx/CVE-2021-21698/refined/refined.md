Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21698:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The Subversion Plugin, in versions 2.15.0 and earlier, does not properly restrict the file name when looking up a subversion key file on the Jenkins controller from an agent. This lack of restriction allows for path traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is the plugin's failure to sanitize or validate the file name provided by the agent. This allows an attacker to include directory traversal sequences (like `../`) in the file name, escaping the intended directory and accessing arbitrary files on the controller.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker in control of an agent process to read any file on the Jenkins controller's file system. This could include sensitive configuration files, credentials, or other confidential data.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Agent:** An attacker needs to compromise a Jenkins agent. Once in control of an agent process, they can initiate a request that causes the Subversion plugin to lookup a subversion key file with a path traversal payload.
* **Agent-to-controller communication**: The vulnerability occurs because of insecure communication between Jenkins agents and the controller through the Subversion plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must have control over a Jenkins agent process.
*   The attacker must be able to initiate requests to the Jenkins controller that trigger the vulnerable file lookup in the Subversion Plugin.
