The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21907.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of sanitization and validation of the `key` parameter in the `getenv` command of the Garrett iC Module's CLI. This allows an attacker to provide directory traversal sequences within the `key` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory traversal (CWE-22): The `getenv` command does not properly validate the input provided for the key, allowing directory traversal sequences such as `../` to access files outside of the intended `/ltrx_user/env/` directory.
- Buffer overflow: While not directly exploitable for code execution according to the report, the `readfile` function copies file contents into a fixed-size buffer (`envBuf`) without checking the file size, which can lead to a stack buffer overflow if the file is larger than 128 bytes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Local file inclusion: An attacker can read arbitrary files on the system (limited to approximately 396 bytes due to the buffer overflow) by exploiting the directory traversal vulnerability in the `getenv` command.
- Potential code execution: While not directly demonstrated in this report, the stack buffer overflow vulnerability could potentially lead to code execution if the attacker could place arbitrary files on the filesystem to create a large file and cause a stack overflow.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted command to the authenticated CLI over TCP port 6877.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated to the CLI interface on TCP port 6877. This implies the attacker must have valid credentials for the device.
