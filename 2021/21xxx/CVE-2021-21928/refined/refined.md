The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21928.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command, specifically within the `device_list` page of the Advantech R-SeeNet application. The application uses prepared statements in combination with stored procedures and SQL concatenation in a way that user-supplied input, despite initial sanitization, loses its protection and introduces SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient sanitization of user input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `mac_filter` parameter is vulnerable. The application uses `mysqli_real_escape_string` for sanitization, but due to the way stored procedures and concatenation are implemented, it does not prevent SQL injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. In the provided example, the attacker is able to introduce a sleep command demonstrating the possibility to execute arbitrary SQL.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the vulnerable `device_list` page. Specifically, the vulnerable parameters are passed as GET parameters

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application. The vulnerability can also be exploited through cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
