Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-21373:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `nimble` package manager, when fetching package lists, falls back to an insecure HTTP URL (`http://irclogs.nim-lang.org/packages.json`) if the initial HTTPS request fails. This fallback occurs without proper validation, potentially exposing users to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Fallback:** The primary vulnerability is the fallback to an insecure HTTP connection when the secure HTTPS connection fails. This bypasses the security measures of TLS/SSL.
*   **Lack of Certificate Validation:** While not the core issue described by the CVE, the related context also notes that `httpClient` in older Nim versions did not validate certificates properly. This allows MitM attacks via spoofed certificates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Package List:** An attacker performing a MitM attack can deliver a modified `packages.json` file.
*   **Untrusted Code Execution:** By manipulating the package list, the attacker can trick the user into downloading and installing malicious software packages, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network MitM:** An attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the user and the server hosting the `packages.json` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to intercept and modify network traffic. This could be achieved through a compromised network device, a rogue Wi-Fi hotspot, or by compromising the user's local network.
* The attacker must be able to trigger a failure of the HTTPS request so that the fallback to HTTP occurs. This may be achieved by blocking or modifying the initial HTTPS request.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Nimble versions prior to 1.4.4.
*   The issue is related to insecure defaults in the `httpClient` and the lack of secure fallback mechanisms in `nimble`.
*   The provided content also mentions related vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-21374, CVE-2021-21372) that involve insecure TLS defaults and arbitrary code execution.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by tintinweb, and the vendor released patches for Nimble versions 1.2.10 and 1.4.4.
