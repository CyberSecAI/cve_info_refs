Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21681:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Nomad Plugin stored Docker registry authentication passwords unencrypted in the `config.xml` file on the Jenkins controller.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Plaintext storage of sensitive credentials.
- Insufficient data protection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Disclosure of Docker registry credentials.
- Unauthorized access to Docker registries if the exposed credentials are valid.
- Potential for further compromise by attackers if the attacker can access to the Jenkins controller file system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Access to the Jenkins controller's file system is required to view the `config.xml` file containing the unencrypted passwords.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have access to the Jenkins controller's file system. This could be due to compromised accounts, or other vulnerabilities.
- The attacker must be able to read the `config.xml` file.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Nomad Plugin versions 0.7.4 and earlier.
- The fix for this vulnerability involves encrypting the passwords in Nomad Plugin version 0.7.5.
- The fix becomes effective only after Jenkins is restarted after updating the plugin.
- This vulnerability has a low severity rating.
