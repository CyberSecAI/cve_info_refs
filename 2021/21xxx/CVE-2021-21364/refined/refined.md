Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21364:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `java.io.File.createTempFile()` in the generated code by Swagger Codegen. This method creates temporary files in the system's temporary directory with insecure default permissions (`-rw-r--r--`). On Unix-like systems where the temporary directory is shared, these permissions allow other local users to read the contents of these temporary files, leading to local information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-378:** Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions.
- **CWE-200:** Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
- **CWE-732:** Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Information Disclosure:**  An attacker can potentially read the contents of the temporary files created by the vulnerable code. The temporary files may contain sensitive information handled by the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker must have local access to the same system where the vulnerable code is running.
- **Shared System:** The system must be a Unix-like system where the temporary directory is shared among users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Account:** An attacker needs a valid user account on the target system.
- **No Elevated Privileges:** No special or elevated privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists within the code generated by Swagger Codegen, meaning that applications using the vulnerable versions of generated code are susceptible.
- The vulnerability is specific to how temporary files are created and the default permissions assigned by the `java.io.File.createTempFile` method.
- The fix involves replacing calls to `java.io.File.createTempFile` with `java.nio.file.Files.createTempFile` which creates files with more restrictive and secure permissions.
- The fix was implemented in commit `35adbd552d5f99b3ff1e0e59da228becc85190f2` and released in version 2.4.19 of swagger-codegen.
- Workarounds exist for users on non-patched versions which consists on manually updating generated source code.
