Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21695:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `FilePath#listFiles` method within the Jenkins agent-to-controller file access control system. This method does not properly check permissions when following symbolic links.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Permissions Check:** The `FilePath#listFiles` method lists files outside of directories that should be accessible by an agent when following symbolic links, which violates the intended access control.
- **Symbolic Link Traversal:** The vulnerability arises because the method traverses symbolic links without validating whether the target of the link is within an allowed directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker controlling an agent process can use the `FilePath#listFiles` to list files and directories outside of its allowed scope on the Jenkins controller file system. This could lead to information disclosure of sensitive files on the controller.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to control a Jenkins agent process.
- The attacker uses the `FilePath#listFiles` method on the agent, exploiting the improper permission check by leveraging symbolic links to access files and directories outside the intended scope.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to execute code on a Jenkins agent that is connected to the vulnerable Jenkins controller. This can be accomplished by having a job execute on the agent.
