Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-21611:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper escaping of display names and IDs of item types on the New Item page in Jenkins.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that are stored within the application and executed when other users view the affected page.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary script execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could result in actions such as:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Stealing of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, tokens).
    *   Defacement of the Jenkins interface.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker exploits the vulnerability by manipulating the display names or IDs of item types that are shown on the New Item page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Privilege:** The attacker needs to be able to specify or control the display names or IDs of item types. This implies having some level of authenticated access to the Jenkins instance. The specific permissions required are not clearly stated in the document but it mentions "attackers able to specify display names or IDs of item types".
*   **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when other users navigate to the New Item page, making it a Stored XSS, which means the user interaction is required from the victim, not the attacker.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that, as of its publication, the Jenkins security team was not aware of any publicly available plugins that allow modification of item type names or IDs from within Jenkins. This suggests the vulnerability may be more easily exploited through custom or yet unknown extensions.
