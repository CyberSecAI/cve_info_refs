The provided content is a vulnerability report for CVE-2021-21871, which is a memory corruption vulnerability in PowerISO.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a missing or incorrect boundary check in the ZLIB decompression implementation when handling a crafted DMG file. Specifically, during the inflation of a ZLIB block, the output buffer size is not properly verified, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Out-of-bounds write due to improper bounds checking during ZLIB decompression.
  - Inadequate validation of the output buffer size during decompression.
  - Lack of proper error handling when ZLIB inflation fails.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trigger a memory corruption vulnerability which can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, and information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious DMG file with a malformed ZLIB section. When the vulnerable software opens this file and attempts to decompress it, the out-of-bounds write will be triggered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted DMG file to a user of the vulnerable software. This could be through a website, email or other file sharing method. The user will need to open the file using the vulnerable version of the software in order for the vulnerability to be triggered.
