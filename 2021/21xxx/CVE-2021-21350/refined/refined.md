All the provided content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from XStream's deserialization process where it uses type information within the processed input stream to recreate Java objects. This allows an attacker to manipulate the input stream, injecting malicious objects or replacing existing ones, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Unsafe Deserialization:** XStream was vulnerable to insecure deserialization due to the lack of proper validation of the types being unmarshalled.
    *   **Blacklist Inadequacy:** XStream's previous reliance on a blacklist to block dangerous classes proved to be insufficient as new classes and attack vectors were discovered.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the target system.
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker could access data streams from arbitrary URLs within the intranet or localhost.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker can cause a DoS by manipulating the processed stream, or cause a ReDos attack.
    *   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the local host, if the executing process has the required rights.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Manipulated Input Stream:** Attackers manipulate the XML (or other format) data that XStream processes during deserialization.
    *   **Malicious Payloads:** The malicious input streams can contain manipulated XML (or other format) that include malicious classes and methods, or can cause loops and consume high resources.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted malicious data stream (e.g., via HTTP if the application uses XStream to parse incoming XML data) to the vulnerable application.
    *   **No authentication is necessary for some of the exploitation scenarios**
    *   **Knowledge of XStream Deserialization:** An attacker needs to understand how XStream deserializes data to create an exploit.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   **Mitigation:** XStream has addressed this issue by implementing a whitelist approach, blocking all classes except those types that have explicit converters.
*   **Workarounds:** The XStream documentation provides workarounds for older versions by blacklisting specific classes and types to prevent their deserialization. However, the recommended approach is always to use a whitelist.
*   **Versions:** Versions prior to 1.4.16 are vulnerable, with 1.4.16 being the first version with the whitelist implementation by default.

In summary, CVE-2021-21350 is a critical vulnerability in XStream caused by unsafe deserialization and a weak blacklist approach, enabling remote attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
