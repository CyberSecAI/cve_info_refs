Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21380:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Rating Script Service in XWiki, which exposes an API to perform SQL requests. The `getAverageRating` method takes `fromsql` and `wheresql` parameters, which are then directly used in the `AbstractRatingManager` to construct SQL queries *without any sanitization or escaping*. This direct incorporation of user-provided data into SQL queries creates an SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The core weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or parameterized queries when constructing SQL statements in the `AbstractRatingManager`. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code through the `fromsql` and `wheresql` parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with script rights can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- This could lead to:
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    - Modification or deletion of data.
    - Potential takeover of the database or the application.
    - Integrity of the application is severely compromised (high).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is **Network** (AV:N). A remote attacker could send specially crafted requests to the XWiki instance.
- The attack complexity is **Low** (AC:L) as the attack is straightforward.
- The attacker needs **Low** privileges (PR:L), specifically script rights on XWiki.
- There is no **User Interaction** required (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have script rights on the XWiki installation.
- The attacker needs network access to the affected XWiki instance.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in versions of XWiki between 6.4-milestone-3 and 12.9RC1.
- It affects only XWiki instances that have the Ratings API installed.
- The vulnerability has been patched in version 12.9RC1.
- A workaround, other than upgrading, is to uninstall the Ratings API through the extension manager.

The information provided in the content is consistent with the CVE description in that it describes an SQL injection vulnerability stemming from a lack of input sanitization. It provides a more granular explanation of the vulnerable code and parameters, and it specifies affected and patched versions.
