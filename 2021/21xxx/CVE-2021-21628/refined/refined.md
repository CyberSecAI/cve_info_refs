Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21628:

**CVE-2021-21628**

*   **Root Cause:** The Build With Parameters Plugin does not sanitize/escape parameter names and descriptions before rendering them in the user interface.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the parameter names or descriptions. When a user views the build configuration with the injected code, the script executes in their browser. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker with `Job/Configure` permission can configure a job with malicious parameter names or descriptions.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs `Job/Configure` permission within the Jenkins instance to modify job configurations.

**Summary:**

The `Build With Parameters` plugin was vulnerable to a stored XSS attack due to improper sanitization of parameter names and descriptions. An attacker with `Job/Configure` permission could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious scripts into these fields, which would then execute in the browsers of users viewing the job configuration page.
