Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-21359

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how TYPO3 CMS handles page errors. When an invalid or non-existent resource is requested, the page error handler is triggered. This handler can attempt to retrieve content from another page to display as an error message. The vulnerability arises because this process can lead to a recursive loop, where the error handler triggers another error, and so on, causing the application to call itself repeatedly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Recursive calls:** The page error handling logic can create an infinite loop, amplifying the impact of the initial request.
- **Uncontrolled resource consumption:** The recursive calls consume server resources without limit.
- **Lack of proper error handling:** The error handler does not prevent the possibility of recursively calling itself when fetching error content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation leads to a denial of service by exhausting server resources (CPU, memory, etc.) until the web server becomes unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** Attacker requests an invalid or non-existent resource via HTTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable TYPO3 CMS instance.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without requiring authentication.
- **Low Technical Skill:** Exploitation does not require any particular skill set.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-405 (Resource consumption) and CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion).
- The provided CVSS score is 5.5 which is classified as medium severity. The vector string is AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C
- The issue has been fixed in TYPO3 versions 9.5.25, 10.4.14, and 11.1.1.
