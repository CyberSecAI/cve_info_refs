- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a missing resource release after its effective lifetime (CWE-772). Specifically, when the Phoenix Contact FL COMSERVER UNI receives an invalid Modbus exception response, it fails to properly handle the resource, leading to a temporary denial-of-service condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the improper handling of Modbus exception responses, resulting in a resource leak. This vulnerability is categorized as CWE-772, "Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime."
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation of this vulnerability results in a temporary denial of service (DoS). The Modbus communication stops, rendering the device unresponsive for a few minutes before functionality is fully restored.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker needs to send a crafted, invalid Modbus exception response to the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the FL COMSERVER UNI via the network and send Modbus commands to it. No special privileges are needed, making this vulnerability easily exploitable by a remote, unauthenticated attacker.
