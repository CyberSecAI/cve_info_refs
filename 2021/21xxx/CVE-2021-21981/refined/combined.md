### Privilege Escalation Observed with Role Assignment Permissions NSX-T 3.1.1

#### Issue/Introduction

With the introduction of the local guest user feature in NSX-T 3.1.1 (GA, January 2021), a potential for privilege escalation was identified.¬† One guest local user with privileges to assign roles to another user can assign privileges greater than his/her own.¬† This can lead to a privilege escalation scenario.¬† The scope of this issue is limited to a particular sequence of configuration steps.

#### Resolution

This issue has been resolved in NSX-T maintenance release 3.1.2.

Workaround:
Do not activate local guest user and/or do not assign RBAC role with user-role assignment permission to local guest users.

#### Additional Information

Impact/Risks:
This potential privilege escalation is only seen in the following scenario:

By default local guest user accounts are disabled and are restricted to "audit" role/permissions.¬† In order to experience this issue an existing NSX Enterprise Administrator must activate the local guest users first.¬† Then the existing NSX Enterprise Administrator must grant "role assignment" permissions to one of the two new local guest user accounts.¬† The local user account which now has "role assignment" permissions then has the ability to assign privileges greater than his/her own permission level.

This potential privilege escalation is only seen with "local guest user" functionality introduced in NSX-T 3.1.1.¬† The scope of this issue is limited to the two additional "local" users and does not apply to remote users from NSX-T LDAP/VIDM integration.¬† In effect, corporate credentials are not affected.
