Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-21981:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue within the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation in VMware NSX-T, specifically related to how role assignment permissions are handled for local guest users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local guest user with the permission to assign roles to other users can assign roles with privileges greater than their own. This allows a low-privileged user to gain higher privileges than intended.
- **Improper RBAC implementation**: The system fails to properly restrict the role assignment capabilities of guest users, allowing them to elevate their own privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a malicious local guest user to escalate their privileges, potentially gaining full administrative control over the NSX-T environment. This could lead to data breaches, system compromise, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network by leveraging the NSX-T management interface.
- **Local guest user account:** A user must have a local guest user account.
- **Role assignment permission:** This local guest user needs to be granted role assignment permissions by an existing NSX Enterprise Administrator.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Access to NSX-T Management Interface:** The attacker needs access to the NSX-T management interface.
2.  **Local Guest User Account:** The attacker must have a valid local guest user account in NSX-T. This account is disabled by default, requiring an administrator to activate it.
3. **Role Assignment Permission:** The local guest user account must have the permission to assign roles to other users. This permission needs to be granted by an existing NSX Enterprise Administrator.

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability is specific to NSX-T version 3.1.1.
- The issue is mitigated in NSX-T version 3.1.2.
- Workarounds include not activating the local guest user feature or not granting role assignment permissions to local guest users.
- The vulnerability does not affect remote users from NSX-T LDAP/VIDM integration and, therefore, corporate credentials are not affected.
- The CVSSv3 base score for this vulnerability is 7.5, indicating a high severity.
