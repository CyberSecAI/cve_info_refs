# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2021-1384

## Dream Report ODS Remote Connector privilege escalation vulnerability

##### December 6, 2021

##### CVE Number

CVE-2021-21957

### Summary

A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Remote Server functionality of Dream Report ODS Remote Connector 20.2.16900.0. A specially-crafted command injection can lead to elevated capabilities. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Dream Report ODS Remote Connector 20.2.16900.0

### Product URLs

<https://dreamreport.net/>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-276 - Incorrect Default Permissions

### Details

Dream Report is an automation platform designed to facilitate collection and parsing of real-time information between various devices in industrial environments.

The service ‘RTM Reporting System Runtime Manager’ is installed during stand-alone installation of ODS Remote Connector and starts with the following command (with high integrity):

```
 c:\program files (x86)\ods\remote connector\system\rtm.exe" -control -runMode svc

```

After above command line is executed, another binary is also started and runs throughout lifecycle of the main service process:

```
"C:\Program Files (x86)\ODS\Remote Connector\System\Rdxa.exe"

```

RTM Reporting System Runtime Manager allows any user on the system to replace a binary located in the default installation folder, as seen below, to execute code with privilege of NT SYSTEM with high integrity:

```
c:\program files (x86)\ods\remote connector\system\Rtm.exe:
BUILTIN\Administrators:(ID)F
Everyone:(ID)F

C:\Program Files (x86)\ODS\Remote Connector\System\Rdxa.exe:
BUILTIN\Administrators:(ID)F
Everyone:(ID)F

```

In addition, due to permission weaknesses, other components such as DLL libraries, used by any of the applications above, can be used to sideload code from the following folder:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\ODS\Remote Connector\System

```

These can be, for example:

```
BatchManager.dll
ChangeManager.dll
FontManagerDll.dll

```

Note that initial exploitation would result in access to the same privilege as a default virtual service user `nt service\rtm reporting system runtime manager`. A full exploitation chain would need to take advantage of the `SeImpersonatePrivilege` privilege assigned to the RTM Reporting System Runtime Manager service to achieve reliable execution with NT SYSTEM privilage.

### Vendor Response

Fixed in Dream Report Remote Connector 20.2.16900.1011

### Timeline

2021-10-05 - Vendor Disclosure

2021-12-02 - Vendor patched

2021-12-06 - Public Release
