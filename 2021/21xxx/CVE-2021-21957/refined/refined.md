- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect default permissions on the `Rtm.exe` and `Rdxa.exe` executables and DLL libraries used by the application, allowing any user on the system to replace these files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Incorrect default file permissions on executables (`Rtm.exe`, `Rdxa.exe`) and DLL libraries in the installation folder allows any user to modify them.
    - Potential for DLL side-loading by placing malicious DLLs in the application's directory.
    - The service account `nt service\rtm reporting system runtime manager` has the `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, which can be used to escalate to NT SYSTEM privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with NT SYSTEM privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can replace the vulnerable executables or DLL libraries with their own malicious files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have local access to the system. The initial exploitation leads to the privileges of the `nt service\rtm reporting system runtime manager` user, which can then be escalated to `NT SYSTEM` privileges using the `SeImpersonatePrivilege`.
