{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow due to unchecked arithmetic when calculating buffer sizes, leading to undersized heap allocations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Heap-based buffer overflows leading to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "Specially crafted MPEG-4 files that trigger the integer overflows during parsing.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a malicious MPEG-4 file. No special privileges are required. User interaction is required to open the malicious file.",
    "affected_code": "The vulnerability resides in the parsing of 'stsc' atoms in the GPAC library."
