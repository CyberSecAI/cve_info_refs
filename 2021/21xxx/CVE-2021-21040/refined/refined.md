**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The vulnerability is a Use-after-free. This type of vulnerability occurs when a program attempts to access memory after it has been freed, which can lead to unpredictable behavior, including crashes or the ability to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:** The document doesn't specify the exact attack vector, but use-after-free vulnerabilities are often triggered by manipulating specific file formats or program states. This specific vulnerability is found in Adobe Acrobat and Reader.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The document doesn't specify the required attacker capabilities or position, but the exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution, which implies the attacker would need to get a crafted file opened by the affected application.
