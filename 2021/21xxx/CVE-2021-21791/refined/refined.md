- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IOBit Advanced SystemCare Ultimate driver exposes an IOCTL that allows reading a word (2 bytes) from an arbitrary I/O port using the `IN` instruction.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient access control on the exposed IOCTL (`0x9c4060d0`). The driver does not validate the provided port number, allowing unprivileged users to read from arbitrary I/O ports.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can read potentially sensitive information from the kernel by reading from various hardware I/O ports.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker can send a specially crafted I/O request packet (IRP) to the vulnerable driver, specifying the I/O port to read from.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to execute code locally on the system to send an IRP to the driver.
