{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The IPv6 header decompression function (`uncompress_hdr_iphc`) in Contiki-NG does not perform proper boundary checks when reading from the packet buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can construct a compressed 6LoWPAN packet that causes the `memcpy` function to read beyond the packet buffer boundary, potentially leading to a crash or other undefined behavior.",
    "attack_vectors": "Sending crafted 6LoWPAN packets to a Contiki-NG device.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device."
  },
  "additional_information": {
    "patch_details": "The vulnerability was patched by adding boundary checks in the decompression function and by ensuring that packets that cannot be decompressed are not passed to the upper layer. A test packet demonstrating the vulnerability was added.",
    "affected_versions": "<= 4.6",
    "patched_versions": "Fixed in the develop branch of the contiki-ng repository, and is expected to be included in the next Contiki-NG release. The fix is available in Contiki-NG PR #1482."
