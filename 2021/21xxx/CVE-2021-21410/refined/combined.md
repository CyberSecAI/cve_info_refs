# Out-of-bounds read in the 6LoWPAN implementation

Low

[joakimeriksson](/joakimeriksson)
published
GHSA-hhwj-2p59-v8p9
Jun 18, 2021

## Package

Contiki-NG

## Affected versions

<= 4.6

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

An out-of-bounds read can be triggered by 6LoWPAN packets sent to Contiki-NG devices. The IPv6 header decompression function

(`uncompress_hdr_iphc`) does not perform proper boundary checks when reading from the packet buffer. Hence, it is possible to construct a compressed 6LoWPAN packet that will read more bytes than what is available from the packet buffer.

In particular, on line 1284 in the module os/net/ipv6/sicslowpan.c, the following statement attempts to read `len` bytes from the packet buffer.

```
memcpy((uint8_t *)exthdr + UIP_EXT_HDR_LEN, hc06_ptr, len);

```

The `len` value is not checked against the number of bytes available in the packet buffer, thereby making `memcpy` read beyond the buffer boundary.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in the develop branch of the contiki-ng repository, and is expected to be included in the next Contiki-NG release.

### Workarounds

Users can apply the patch in [Contiki-NG PR #1482](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1482).

### @nvt **[nvt](/nvt)** commented [Dec 23, 2020](#issue-773965988)

Unlike for the 6LoWPAN compression function, there are no boundary checks in the decompression function. Additionally, packets that are not decompressed correctly are passed on the to the upper layer because the IPHC decompression function does not return a value indicating whether the operation succeeded.

This PR addresses these two issues. Moreover, a packet that demonstrates the out-of-bounds read is added to the packet test, but the problem might be noticed only when compiled with an address sanitizer.

Sorry, something went wrong.
