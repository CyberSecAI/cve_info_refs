Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21703:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a design flaw in PHP-FPM's (FastCGI Process Manager) handling of shared memory.
*   Specifically, the main PHP-FPM process and its worker processes share a memory region where an array of pointers to worker scoreboards is stored. The main process uses these pointers to manage worker processes.
*   However, worker processes can modify this array of pointers, leading to the root process reading/writing outside the shared memory segment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read/Write:** Worker processes can manipulate the pointers in the shared memory to force the root process to access memory locations outside of the intended shared memory, leading to out-of-bounds reads and writes.
*   **Insecure Shared Memory Usage:** The design allows unprivileged worker processes to modify data that is used by the privileged (root) process, which makes it susceptible to privilege escalation attacks.
*  **Improper Validation:** The vulnerability arises because of insufficient validation and protection of data structures within the shared memory segment which leads to privilege escalation.
*   **Use of Pointers:** The use of pointers within shared memory, which are modifiable by less privileged worker processes, is inherently insecure in this context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating shared memory, an attacker with access to a PHP-FPM worker process (e.g., `www-data`) can escalate their privileges to root on the server.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Through a series of memory manipulations, an attacker can gain arbitrary code execution in the context of the root process.
*   **Denial of Service:** Malicious modifications in the shared memory could crash the main PHP-FPM process leading to denial of service.
*  **Information Disclosure:** Attackers may be able to access sensitive data stored within the process memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shared Memory Manipulation:** Attackers need the ability to modify the shared memory region accessible to worker processes which can be obtained by gaining access to a worker process.
*   **PHP Sandbox Escape:** A typical path to compromise a worker process is through a PHP sandbox escape vulnerability.
*  **PHP-FPM Worker Access:** Access is needed to one of the FPM worker processes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **PHP Code Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to execute PHP code on the server, typically through a web application. This could be achieved by a successful remote code execution vulnerability or some other arbitrary PHP execution vector.
*   **Access to Worker Process Memory:** The attacker requires the ability to read and modify the memory of a PHP-FPM worker process.
*  **Understanding of Shared Memory Layout:** A good understanding of the shared memory layout and FPM's memory handling is required to craft an effective exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability existed since PHP 5.3.7 up to PHP 8.0.12.
* The vulnerability is present because the fpm\_scoreboard struct uses pointers to other structs.
* The official fix was to change scoreboard->procs to be an array of `fpm_scoreboard_proc_s` instead of an array of pointers to `fpm_scoreboard_proc_s`, and ensuring that the `scoreboard->nprocs` variable is not used in the main process but instead uses the configured value of max children..
