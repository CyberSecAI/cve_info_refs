- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Defect in user permission management by the cloud-end app.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper permission and access control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Users whose sharing permissions have been revoked can still control the camera. This includes actions such as restarting the camera and restoring factory settings.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through the cloud-end app interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have had sharing permissions to the affected camera at some point and then have these permissions revoked.
