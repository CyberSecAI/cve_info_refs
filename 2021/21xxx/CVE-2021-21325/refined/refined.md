    *   Manipulation of the application
    *   Other malicious actions within the context of the user's browser session

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the user interface where new budget types are defined.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
* This is a stored XSS vulnerability, meaning the malicious script is saved in the application's database and executed when other users access the affected functionality.
* The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" in severity.
