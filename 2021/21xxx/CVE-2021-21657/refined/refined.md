Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21657:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Filesystem Trigger Plugin, in versions 0.40 and earlier, does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. This is due to the lack of disabling external entity resolution when parsing XML files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE Vulnerability:** The core weakness is the lack of proper configuration of the XML parser, which allows processing of external entities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
- **Extraction of Secrets:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the Jenkins controller or agent by exploiting the parsing of crafted XML documents.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The vulnerability can be leveraged to perform SSRF attacks.
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** It could be used to trigger denial-of-service conditions through parsing of malicious XML.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves:
- **Crafted XML Document:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted XML document that includes malicious external entities.
- **File Polling:** The vulnerability is triggered when Jenkins parses the crafted XML as part of its file polling process (monitoring changes in files).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Job/Configure Permission or Control Over XML Content:** An attacker needs one of the following:
    -  **Job/Configure permission** on a Jenkins job that uses the vulnerable plugin or has the ability to otherwise specify the XML file being monitored.
    -  The attacker needs to be able to control the contents of an XML file that is polled by the affected plugin. This control could be via a file that is directly polled or an XML document referenced by the polled file.
