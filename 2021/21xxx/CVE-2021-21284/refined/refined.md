{
  "CVE-2021-21284": {
    "Description": "When using `--userns-remap`, if the root user in the remapped namespace has access to the host filesystem they can modify files under `/var/lib/docker/<remapping>` that cause writing files with extended privileges.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the remapped root user in a user namespace having write access to the host's filesystem, specifically under `/var/lib/docker/<remapping>`, allowing them to manipulate files leading to privilege escalation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect file permissions in the remapped user namespace.",
       "The remapped root user has write access to the host filesystem under `/var/lib/docker/<remapping>`"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remapped root user can escalate privileges to real root on the host by modifying files with extended privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploitation occurs through the `--userns-remap` feature, where a remapped root user has access to the host filesystem.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to run containers with the `--userns-remap` option, and gain access to the remapped root user within that container"
  }
