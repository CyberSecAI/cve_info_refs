- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Reflected cross-site scripting
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation leading to reflected XSS.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary JavaScript execution within the context of the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted input to the Adobe Connect application which is then reflected back to the user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to craft a malicious URL or input that, when processed by the application, would inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
