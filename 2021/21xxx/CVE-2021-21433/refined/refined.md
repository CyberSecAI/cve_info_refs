Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2021-21433.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper input validation in the `.dirsearch` and `.arjun` commands within the Discord-Recon application. Specifically, the application allowed users to inject arbitrary commands through the arguments provided to these commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-provided input before passing it to the underlying system shell. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The core issue is the absence of proper checks on the `argument` variable which is used in subprocess.Popen.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Discord-Recon bot. This can lead to complete compromise of the system, data breaches, denial of service, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Discord bot commands: Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted input to the `.dirsearch` and `.arjun` commands through the Discord bot interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to interact with the Discord bot: An attacker needs to be able to send commands to the Discord bot to trigger the vulnerable code. No specific position within the network is required, just access to the Discord bot.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable commands: The attacker needs to know which commands are vulnerable to exploit the flaw (.dirsearch and .arjun)
