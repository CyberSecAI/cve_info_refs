Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21115:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a "use-after-free" error within the safe browsing component of the Chromium browser. This means that the program attempts to access memory after it has been freed, potentially leading to corruption or crashes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Use-after-free: The core weakness is the unsafe access of freed memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Arbitrary Code Execution: A successful exploit could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's system. This would allow an attacker to perform malicious actions like installing malware, stealing data, or taking control of the system.
*   Denial of Service: The vulnerability could also cause the browser to crash, leading to a denial of service.
*   Information Disclosure: In some scenarios, this type of vulnerability can lead to information disclosure from memory.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the Chromium browser itself. An attacker would need to find a way to trigger the vulnerability through the safe browsing mechanism. This may involve crafting a malicious website or manipulating data that is processed by the safe browsing module.
*   The vulnerability exists within the safe browsing component, implying that it is likely triggered by interacting with websites or other content that is checked by the browser's safe browsing mechanisms.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker would need to entice the victim to use a vulnerable version of Chrome and interact with specially crafted content or a malicious website.
*   No specific privileged access to the user's system is required to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The attacker would likely need to have knowledge of the vulnerability details to craft an appropriate exploit.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in Chromium version 87.0.4280.141.
*   Several sources confirm that this is a high-severity vulnerability.
