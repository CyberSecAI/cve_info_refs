Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21171:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to an "Incorrect security UI" in the TabStrip and Navigation components of the Chromium browser. This indicates a flaw in how the browser visually presents security-related information or interacts with user actions related to tabs and navigation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Incorrect Security UI:** The core weakness lies in the user interface's failure to properly represent security-related states, which could lead users to make incorrect assumptions about the safety of their browsing activities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- The primary impact would be misleading the user into believing that they are in a secure context when they are not or vice versa. The user might interact with the browser in a way that they otherwise would not if they had been presented with the correct security information. This misrepresentation could potentially lead to a range of consequences, from phishing attacks to unintentional execution of malicious code or content.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector involves manipulating the browser's UI in the context of TabStrip and Navigation to cause a misrepresentation of security state. The exact mechanism to achieve this UI manipulation isn't detailed but it would likely involve crafting malicious web content or exploiting other browser vulnerabilities to trigger the incorrect display.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-  An attacker would need to be able to cause the vulnerable browser to display a misleading security user interface, this can be achieved either by crafting malicious website content, or exploiting another vulnerability in the browser to allow the manipulation of the UI state.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability is described as a "medium" severity issue, but the precise mechanism and potential for exploitation may vary based on the specific context and browser version.
-   The fix for this issue was included in Chromium version 89.0.4389.72.
-   The vulnerability was reported by Irvan Kurniawan.
