Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21311:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Adminer handles responses from Elasticsearch and ClickHouse servers. Specifically, when attempting to connect to these servers, Adminer would print the response, regardless of the HTTP status code. This behavior allowed for the exploitation of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Adminer did not properly validate or sanitize the server responses from Elasticsearch and ClickHouse. This allowed an attacker to control the server Adminer connects to, and force it to make requests to arbitrary internal servers by exploiting a redirect.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** By exploiting this SSRF vulnerability, an attacker could retrieve sensitive information from internal servers accessible to the Adminer instance, like AWS metadata service to obtain access keys, instance IDs, or other confidential data.
*   **Internal Network Scanning:** Attackers could use the vulnerability to scan the internal network and enumerate available services.
*   **Lateral Movement:** In the context of AWS, if the compromised server possesses AWS keys, an attacker could potentially move laterally within the AWS environment.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Database Connection:** The attack vector involves using the Elasticsearch or ClickHouse login modules within Adminer.
*   **Redirect:** An attacker sets up a malicious server that responds with a 301 redirect to an internal resource that the attacker wants to access. When Adminer attempts to connect to the malicious server, it will follow the redirect, thus extracting the data in the server response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Adminer:** The attacker needs to be able to access the Adminer application and attempt a connection via either the Elasticsearch or ClickHouse modules.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach a server under their control and the adminer server must have network access to the target internal servers.
*   **Understanding of Internal Network:** Some knowledge of the target internal network will be necessary to discover useful resources to target (e.g., the AWS metadata service address).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Adminer versions from 4.0.0 up to 4.7.8.
*   The fix was implemented in version 4.7.9 by preventing the printing of responses when the HTTP code is not 200.
*   Workarounds for the vulnerability included:
    *   Using single-driver versions of Adminer (e.g. `adminer-mysql.php`).
    *   Protecting access to Adminer via HTTP password, IP address limiting, or OTP plugins.
*   The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery).
