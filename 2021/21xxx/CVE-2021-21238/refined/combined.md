PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard.
It contains all necessary pieces for building a SAML2 service provider
or an identity provider. The distribution contains examples of both.
Originally written to work in a WSGI environment
there are extensions that allow you to use it with other frameworks.

## Installation

You can install PySAML2 through pip:

```
pip install pysaml2
```

### External dependencies

PySAML2 works with the [`xmlsec`](http://www.aleksey.com/xmlsec/) binary.
Notice that support for xmlsec `1 1.3` was added with `v7.4.2`.

`xmlsec` should be readily available in most Linux distributions:

```
$ apt-get install xmlsec1
$ dnf install xmlsec1-openssl
$ yum install xmlsec1-openssl
$ pacman -S xmlsec
...
```

and on MacOS through [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh/)

```
$ brew install libxmlsec1
```

# Processing of invalid SAML XML documents

High

[c00kiemon5ter](/c00kiemon5ter)
published
GHSA-f4g9-h89h-jgv9
Jan 20, 2021

## Package

pysaml2
(pypi)

## Affected versions

<= 6.4.1

## Patched versions

6.5.0

## Description

### Impact

All users of pysaml2 that use the default `CryptoBackendXmlSec1` backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. `pysaml2 <= 6.4.1` does not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allows invalid XML documents to trick the verification process, by presenting elements with a valid signature inside elements whose content has been malformed. The verification is offloaded to `xmlsec1` and `xmlsec1` will not validate every signature in the given document, but only the first it finds in the given scope.

### Patches

Users should upgrade to pysaml2 `v6.5.0`.

### Workarounds

No workaround provided at this point.

### References

No references provided at this point.

* Juraj Somorovsky (Paderborn University)
* Vladislav Mladenov (Ruhr University Bochum)

# Security: IdentityPython/pysaml2

## Security

### SECURITY.md

# Security Policy

You can find more information on security incidents
on the [IdPy security webpage](https://idpy.org/security/).

You read on the [incident response policy](https://github.com/IdentityPython/Governance/blob/master/idpy-incidentresponse.md)
under the [governance documentation](https://github.com/IdentityPython/Governance).

## Incident report / Reporting a Vulnerability

Anyone can submit a potential security vulnerability to `incident-response@idpy.org`.
The incident-response team will verify the issue and contact you on how this will be
handled.

## Public Discussions

When a new vulnerability is reported and verified, a new security advisory is created on
GitHub and the issue is assigned a CVE identifier. Progress on the mitigation is tracked
on a private fork, where the incident-response team and developers communicate to fix
the issue.

When the fix is ready, a release plan is prepared and all communication channels are
used to notify the community of the presence of a new issue and the expected release
plan. This allows the community time to prepare for a security upgrade. (Notice that
security fixes are not backported at the moment.)

When the advisory is published, GitHub automatically notifies all associated projects of
the published advisory. Projects that use IdPy projects as dependencies should
automatically get Pull Requests by dependabot. Additionally, all communication channels
are used again, to notify the community of the release of a new version of the affected
software that contains the relevant fixes that mitigate the reported issue.

## Supported versions

Notice, that security fixes are not backported at the moment to older releases than the
latest. The team does not have the capacity to guarantee that these backports will exist.
You are advised to be prepared to upgrade to the latest version once the fix is out.
