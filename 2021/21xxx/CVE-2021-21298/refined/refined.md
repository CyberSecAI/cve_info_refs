Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-21298:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper path validation in the Projects API of the `@node-red/runtime` module. Specifically, the API did not adequately restrict file access to within the project directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal: The core weakness is a path traversal vulnerability, which allows an attacker to access files outside the intended project directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary File Access: An attacker could potentially read any file on the server's filesystem that the Node-RED process has access to. This could expose sensitive data, configuration files, or other confidential information.
- Information Disclosure: The primary impact is the potential disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- Projects API: The vulnerability is triggered by requests to the Projects API.
- Crafted File Paths: An attacker would need to craft a malicious file path using ".." sequences to traverse out of the project directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- `projects.read` Permission: The attacker must have `projects.read` permission within Node-RED. This means they have some level of authorized access to the Node-RED editor where the project feature is enabled.
- Enabled Projects Feature: The Projects feature must be enabled in the Node-RED instance. This feature is not enabled by default.
