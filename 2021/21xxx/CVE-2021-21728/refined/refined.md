- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A certain port is open by default.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Configuration error leading to an open port.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can reduce system processing capabilities by consuming resources through flooding the open port with packets.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based, by sending a large number of packets to the open port.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device (Adjacent network).
