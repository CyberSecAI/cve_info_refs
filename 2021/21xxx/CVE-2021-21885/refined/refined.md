- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of user-controlled HTTP POST parameters (`cwd` and `dst`) in the `FsMove` functionality of the Lantronix PremierWave 2050 Web Manager. This allows path traversal using primitives like `../`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path Traversal (CWE-22) vulnerability exists due to insufficient input validation, allowing an attacker to manipulate file paths.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can move arbitrary files to arbitrary locations, including the `/ltrx_user/` directory, making them readable by any authenticated user, regardless of permission. This can lead to arbitrary file reading and overwriting.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/` endpoint of the device with modified `cwd` and `dst` parameters in the `FsMove` ajax call.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with `filesystem` privilege to exploit this vulnerability.
