## Descriptions

### Reflected XSS vulnerability in Credentials Plugin

**SECURITY-2349
/
CVE-2021-21648**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`credentials`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials)**

**Description:**

Credentials Plugin 2.3.18 and earlier does not escape user-controlled information on a view it provides.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Credentials Plugin 2.3.19 restricts the user-controlled information it provides to a safe subset.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Dashboard View Plugin

**SECURITY-2233
/
CVE-2021-21649**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`dashboard-view`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/dashboard-view)**

**Description:**

Dashboard View Plugin 2.15 and earlier does not escape URLs referenced in Image Dashboard Portlets.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with View/Configure permission.

Dashboard View Plugin 2.16 does not render unsafe URLs.

As part of this fix, the property for image URLs was changed from `url` to `imageUrl`.
Existing [Configuration as Code](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code/) configurations are still supported, but exports will emit the new property.

### Missing permission checks in S3 publisher Plugin allow obtaining metadata about artifacts

**SECURITY-2200
/
CVE-2021-21650**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`s3`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/s3)**

**Description:**

S3 publisher Plugin 0.11.6 and earlier does not perform Run/Artifacts permission checks in various HTTP endpoints and API models.

This allows attackers with Item/Read permission to obtain information about artifacts uploaded to S3, if the optional Run/Artifacts permission is enabled.

S3 publisher Plugin 0.11.7 requires Run/Artifacts permission to obtain information about artifacts if this permission is enabled.

### Missing permission check in S3 publisher Plugin

**SECURITY-2201
/
CVE-2021-21651**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`s3`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/s3)**

**Description:**

S3 publisher Plugin 0.11.6 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to obtain the list of configured profiles.

S3 publisher Plugin 0.11.7 performs permission checks when providing a list of configured profiles.

### CSRF vulnerability in Xray - Test Management for Jira Plugin allows capturing credentials

**SECURITY-2251 (1)
/
CVE-2021-21652**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`xray-connector`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xray-connector)**

**Description:**

Xray - Test Management for Jira Plugin 2.4.0 and earlier does not require POST requests for a connection test method, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Xray - Test Management for Jira Plugin 2.4.1 requires POST requests for the affected connection test method.

### Missing permission check in Xray - Test Management for Jira Plugin allows enumerating credentials IDs

**SECURITY-2251 (2)
/
CVE-2021-21653**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`xray-connector`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xray-connector)**

**Description:**

Xray - Test Management for Jira Plugin 2.4.0 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in Xray - Test Management for Jira Plugin 2.4.1 requires the appropriate permissions.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in P4 Plugin

**SECURITY-2327
/
CVE-2021-21654 (permission check), CVE-2021-21655 (CSRF)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`p4`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/p4)**

**Description:**

P4 Plugin 1.11.4 and earlier does not perform permission checks in multiple HTTP endpoints implementing connection tests.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified Perforce server using attacker-specified username and password.

Additionally, these HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

P4 Plugin 1.11.5 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer for the affected HTTP endpoints.

### XXE vulnerability in Xcode integration Plugin

**SECURITY-2335
/
CVE-2021-21656**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`xcode-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin)**

**Description:**

Xcode integration Plugin 2.0.14 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers able to control the input files for the Xcode build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted Xcode Workspace File that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

Xcode integration Plugin 2.0.15 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.
