Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-21623:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Matrix Authorization Strategy Plugin did not correctly perform permission checks to determine if an item (like a job) should be accessible. This plugin is used to manage permissions in Jenkins. Items can be organized hierarchically (e.g., using the Folders plugin), and an item should only be accessible if all its parent folders are also accessible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Permission Checks:** The plugin failed to verify if a user had the necessary 'Item/Read' permissions on parent folders before granting access to nested items.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker with 'Item/Read' permission on a nested item could access it, even if they lacked 'Item/Read' permission for its parent folders. This circumvents the intended access control mechanism.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers might gain unauthorized access to sensitive project information or configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker would require network access to the Jenkins instance.
- **Exploitation Path:** An attacker with 'Item/Read' permission to a nested item, but not to its parent folder can access the nested item.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have a user account with 'Item/Read' permission to at least one nested item within Jenkins, while lacking this permission for parent folders.
- The attacker needs to have network access to the Jenkins instance.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is fixed in Matrix Authorization Strategy Plugin version 2.6.6.
- A workaround for older releases is to avoid granting permissions on individual items to users who don't have access to parent items.
- A system property can be set to disable the fix, but it's not recommended.
