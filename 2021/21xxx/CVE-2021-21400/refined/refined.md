Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-21400

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The application lock (applock) modal did not properly enforce focus on the input field, resulting in typed input being sent to the most recently used chat instead of the app lock input when the input field was not explicitly focused.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper input focus management in the app lock modal.
- Lack of explicit focus on the input field within the modal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Passphrases intended for the app lock could be sent as chat messages, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A user opens the app lock modal, and without explicitly focusing the input field, starts typing their passphrase.
- The typed passphrase is then sent as a message to the last active chat conversation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be a user of the application who has the app lock feature enabled.
- The attacker doesn't necessarily need to perform any special actions, other than exploiting the lack of focus on the input element.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for the vulnerability is implemented by programmatically forcing focus on the input field within the app lock modal using the `onBlur` event handler and `ref` to trigger the focus using `setTimeout`.
- This vulnerability is present in versions of `wire-webapp` prior to `2021-03-15-production.0`.
- The severity of this vulnerability is rated as "High".
