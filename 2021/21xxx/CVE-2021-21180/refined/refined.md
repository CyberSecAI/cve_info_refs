Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-21180:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error located within the tab search component of the Chromium browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** This occurs when memory is freed, and then a pointer to that memory is dereferenced/used. This can cause crashes, unexpected behavior, and potentially, arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a potential for arbitrary code execution. An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to run malicious code on a user's system.
-  Secondary impacts might include application crashes and other unexpected behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability exists within the tab search component of the browser.
- An attacker would need to craft a scenario that triggers the use-after-free condition during tab searching operations within the Chromium browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have a way to induce a user to trigger the vulnerability, most likely through a specially crafted webpage or malicious browser extension.
- The attacker does not need to have any special permissions on the user's machine.
- This can be exploited remotely via network.
