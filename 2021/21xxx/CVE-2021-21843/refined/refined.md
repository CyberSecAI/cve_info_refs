{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow in the `ssix_box_read` function when calculating the size of the `ranges` array. The multiplication of `subseg->range_count` with `sizeof(GF_SubsegmentRangeInfo)` results in an integer overflow, which leads to an undersized memory allocation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Heap-based Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit can result in a heap-based buffer overflow, leading to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution in the context of the library.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted MPEG-4 file. An attacker can convince a user to open a video file containing a malicious 'ssix' atom with a large `range_count` value.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to create a malicious MPEG-4 file with a crafted 'ssix' atom and convince a user to open the file using the vulnerable software."
