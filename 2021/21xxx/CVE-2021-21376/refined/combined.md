# 2021-SV1 User Context

affects OMERO.web versions prior to 5.9.0

---

 [back to Advisories](/security/advisories/)

---

### Synopsis

OMERO.web exposes some unnecessary session information in the page.

### Background

OMERO.web loads various information about the current user such as their id, name and the groups they are in, and these are available on the main webclient pages. Some additional information being loaded is not used by the webclient and is being removed in this release.

This vulnerability is identified as [CVE-2021-21376](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21376) and
[GHSA-gfp2-w5jm-955q](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gfp2-w5jm-955q).

### Affected Packages

OMERO.web before 5.9.0.

### Impact

High severity.

[CVSS score 6.6 vector AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C/CR:H/IR:H/AR:H/MAV:N/MAC:H/MPR:L/MUI:R/MS:U/MC:H/MI:H/MA:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C/CR:H/IR:H/AR:H/MAV:N/MAC:H/MPR:L/MUI:R/MS:U/MC:H/MI:H/MA:H)

### Resolution

All OMERO.web should be upgraded to at least 5.9.0.
