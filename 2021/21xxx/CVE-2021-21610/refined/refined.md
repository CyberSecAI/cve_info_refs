**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists because Jenkins does not implement restrictions for the URL rendering the formatted preview of markup passed as a query parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code within the markup parameter and trick a user into accessing this URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need any specific permissions and only needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and induce a user into accessing it. The vulnerability is triggered when a user attempts to preview the formatted markup. The attacker needs knowledge of the configuration of the target and the available markup formatters. The configured markup formatter must also allow unsafe elements (like JavaScript) in the markup.
