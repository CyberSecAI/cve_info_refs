- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient verification of data reliability when authenticating optical modules.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The system does not sufficiently verify the data reliability, allowing the replacement of an authenticated optical module with an unauthenticated one.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Bypassing system authentication and detection, potentially affecting signal transmission.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to the equipment is required to replace the optical module.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the device in order to replace the optical module, and they must be able to replace the module.
