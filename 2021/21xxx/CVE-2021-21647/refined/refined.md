Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21647:

**Root Cause:**

*   The CloudBees CD Plugin, in versions 1.1.21 and earlier, lacks a permission check in a specific HTTP endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing permission check:** The plugin does not verify if the user has the necessary "Item/Build" permission before allowing them to schedule builds via an HTTP endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker with "Item/Read" permission can schedule builds of projects, even without the "Item/Build" permission. This could lead to:
    *   Resource consumption on the Jenkins server.
    *   Execution of unauthorized build processes, potentially leading to further security compromises depending on the build configuration.
    *   Disruption of normal CI/CD pipelines.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through an HTTP endpoint in the CloudBees CD Plugin. An attacker can send a request to this endpoint to schedule builds.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have at least "Item/Read" permission on the Jenkins instance. This means the attacker needs to have an account on the Jenkins server and have read access to the targeted projects.
