- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The file path filtering implementation in Jenkins did not canonicalize paths, allowing operations to follow symbolic links to outside allowed directories.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** File path filters do not canonicalize paths.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Allows agent processes to bypass file path restrictions and perform operations on files outside of their allowed directories by following symbolic links, enabling read and write of arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system.
- **Attack vectors:** An agent process can perform file operations on the Jenkins controller.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to control an agent process connected to the Jenkins controller.
