Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the VMware Workspace ONE endpoint reflecting user-controlled content, specifically the `Referer` HTTP header, within an HTTP redirect's `Location` header without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the `Referer` header, which is then reflected in the `Location` header. In certain circumstances, this can lead to JavaScript execution within the victim's browser.
*   **Open Redirect:** The endpoint uses the content of the `Referer` header to redirect the user. Because there is no validation or sanitization of the `Referer` header, an attacker can redirect the user to an arbitrary domain.
*   **data URI execution:** The application allows for arbitrary schemes, meaning that an attacker can inject a data URI as the `Referer`. Safari on iOS will render and execute javascript within a `data` URI in a location header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Limited XSS:** An attacker can inject and execute JavaScript in a victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious activities. The XSS is considered "limited" because it only executes under specific conditions (e.g. Safari on iOS).
*   **Open Redirect:**  Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites, potentially for phishing or malware distribution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through manipulation of the `Referer` HTTP header. The attacker needs to control this header to inject malicious code or a redirect URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send a request to the vulnerable endpoint with a crafted `Referer` header. This is usually achievable through methods like sending a crafted link to the user or other techniques where the attacker can influence the `Referer` header sent in the victim's browser request.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is considered a low security risk.
* The vulnerability was discovered by Leif Enders and Lauritz Holtmann of usd AG.
* The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates both the Open Redirect and Limited XSS vulnerabilities with sample HTTP requests and responses.
* The advisory mentions that VMware has released a fix for this vulnerability.
* The fix involves treating all user input as potentially malicious and sanitizing it, using whitelisting, and replacing meta-characters.
