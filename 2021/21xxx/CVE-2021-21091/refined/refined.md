Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-21091:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the improper parsing of HEIC files within Adobe Bridge. Specifically, the application fails to properly validate user-supplied data when processing HEIC files, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, where the application attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer. This occurs during the parsing of HEIC files.
* **Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data:** The core issue is the absence of proper input validation of user-provided data, allowing the out-of-bounds read to occur.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information by reading data from memory locations beyond the intended boundaries.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** While this specific vulnerability is related to information disclosure, the advisory notes that it could be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious HEIC File:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious HEIC file.
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required, meaning the target user must open the malicious file in Adobe Bridge. Alternatively, the user needs to visit a malicious webpage that leverages this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious HEIC file to the target user.
* The attacker also needs the user to open the crafted HEIC file with the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Adobe Bridge versions 10.1.1 and earlier, as well as 11.0.1 and earlier on Windows.
*   Adobe has released updates (versions 10.1.2 and 11.0.2) to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Adobe by Francis Provencher {PRL} working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
* The CVSS score is 3.3 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).
