Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-21667:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Scriptler Plugin (versions 3.2 and earlier) does not properly escape parameter names when displaying them in job configuration forms.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into parameter names. When a user views the job configuration, these scripts will execute within their browser, potentially leading to:

*   **Data theft:** Stealing session cookies, authentication tokens, or other sensitive data.
*   **Account compromise:** Taking over the user's account on the Jenkins instance.
*   **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or triggering downloads.
*   **Unauthorized actions:** Performing actions on the Jenkins instance with the user's permissions.

**Attack vectors:**
* An attacker with `Scriptler/Configure` permission can inject malicious scripts by including them in parameter names of Scriptler scripts.
* When another user views the job configuration page, the malicious scripts are executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker needs to have `Scriptler/Configure` permission in Jenkins, allowing them to modify script definitions.
* The attacker does not require any interaction from the victim besides viewing the job configuration.
