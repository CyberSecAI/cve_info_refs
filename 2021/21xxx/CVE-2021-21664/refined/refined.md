{
  "CVE-2021-21664": {
    "Root cause": "The XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin 10.0.1 and earlier has an incorrect permission check in a form validation method.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect permission check",
        "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) due to the form validation method not requiring POST requests"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs, capturing username/password credentials stored in Jenkins.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network-based attack via HTTP requests to vulnerable form validation method.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs Overall/Read permission in Jenkins and the ability to make HTTP requests. Attackers need to obtain credentials IDs through another method (e.g., CVE-2021-21662)."
