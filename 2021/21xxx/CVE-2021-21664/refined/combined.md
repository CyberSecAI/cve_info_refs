* XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin 10.0.2

Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and
attribution can be found here:
<https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2021-06-10/>

We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list:
<https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories>

If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as
described here:

SECURITY-2370 / CVE-2021-21661
Kubernetes CLI Plugin 1.10.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks
in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials
IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

SECURITY-1981 / CVE-2021-21662
XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin 10.0.1 and earlier does not perform a permission
check in a method implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials
IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

SECURITY-1982 / CVE-2021-21663 (missing permission check) & CVE-2021-21664 (incorrect permission check) & CVE-2021-21665 (CSRF)
XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin 10.0.1 and earlier does not (correctly) perform
a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an
attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained
through another method, capturing Username/password credentials stored in
Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

SECURITY-2367 / CVE-2021-21666
Kiuwan Plugin 1.6.0 and earlier does not escape output that can indirectly
be controlled through query parameters in an error message for a form
validation endpoint.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

NOTE: Only older releases of Jenkins are affected by this vulnerability.
Jenkins 2.275 and newer, LTS 2.263.2 and newer include a protection
preventing this from being exploitable.

# Jenkins Security Advisory 2021-06-10

This advisory announces vulnerabilities in the following Jenkins deliverables:

* [Kiuwan
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/kiuwanJenkinsPlugin)
* [Kubernetes CLI
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/kubernetes-cli)
* [XebiaLabs XL Deploy
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/deployit-plugin)

## Descriptions

### Missing permission checks allow enumerating credentials IDs in Kubernetes CLI Plugin

**SECURITY-2370
/
CVE-2021-21661**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`kubernetes-cli`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/kubernetes-cli)**

**Description:**

Kubernetes CLI Plugin 1.10.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in Kubernetes CLI Plugin 1.10.1 requires the appropriate permissions.

### Missing permission check in XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin allows enumerating credentials IDs

**SECURITY-1981
/
CVE-2021-21662**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`deployit-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/deployit-plugin)**

**Description:**

XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin 10.0.1 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin 10.0.2 requires the appropriate permissions.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin allows capturing credentials

**SECURITY-1982
/
CVE-2021-21663 (missing permission check), CVE-2021-21664 (incorrect permission check), CVE-2021-21665 (CSRF)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`deployit-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/deployit-plugin)**

**Description:**

XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin 10.0.1 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing Username/password credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin 10.0.2 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation method.

|  | The permission check was partially fixed in XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin 7.5.9: A permission check was added, but for the wrong permission, still allowing some non-admin users to access the form validation method. |

### Reflected XSS vulnerability in Kiuwan Plugin

**SECURITY-2367
/
CVE-2021-21666**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`kiuwanJenkinsPlugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/kiuwanJenkinsPlugin)**

**Description:**

Kiuwan Plugin 1.6.0 and earlier does not escape output that can indirectly be controlled through query parameters in an error message for a form validation endpoint.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

|  | Only older releases of Jenkins are affected by this vulnerability. Jenkins 2.275 and newer, LTS 2.263.2 and newer include a protection preventing this from being exploitable. |
| --- | --- |

Kiuwan Plugin 1.6.1 escapes affected parts of the error message in the form validation endpoint.

## Severity
