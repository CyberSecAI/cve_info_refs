Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21368:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `msgpack5` library, when decoding a map, doesn't properly handle the `__proto__` key. It directly assigns the decoded value associated with the `__proto__` key to the object's prototype, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Prototype poisoning:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to modify the prototype of a decoded object by including the `__proto__` key in the encoded data. This can result in the decoded object having unexpected properties, methods, or throwing errors when used.
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the `msgpack5` library before the patched versions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Type confusion:** Exploitation can cause an object to appear as a different type (e.g., a regular object behaving like a Map).
- **Unexpected behavior:** The modified prototype can cause unexpected behavior such as errors when attempting to access properties or methods that do not exist or that are not expected.
- **Limited prototype pollution:**  While it is not a complete prototype pollution, it modifies the prototype of a decoded object and not the global prototype.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: An attacker can send a crafted message pack payload to a vulnerable service.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted message pack payload that includes the `__proto__` key and a malicious value to be assigned as the prototype.
- The attacker must have access to a service that uses `msgpack5` to decode data.
- User interaction is required in that a service that uses msgpack5 must decode the malicious payload.
- The attack complexity is rated as high

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in versions 5.2.1, 4.5.1, and 3.6.1 of `msgpack5`. Users should upgrade to these versions or later.
- A mitigation strategy provided is to always validate data after parsing before any processing

**Additional Details:**
- The fix introduces a `protoAction` option with values: `error` (default, throws an error), `remove` (removes the property), and `ignore` (allows the property which causes the prototype poisoning).
- The advisory provides a detailed example of how the vulnerability can be exploited, including the crafted payload and the resulting unexpected behavior.

This content provides more detail than the description given in the original CVE description, specifically the options available to handle the `__proto__` property during decoding and how to mitigate the issue in code.
