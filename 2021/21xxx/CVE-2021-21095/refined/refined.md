Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-21095

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the processing of embedded fonts within Adobe Bridge.
- Specifically, the issue stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data. This leads to a write operation that exceeds the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The software writes data beyond the allocated memory buffer. This is triggered during the parsing of a malicious embedded font.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute malicious code within the context of the current user, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- User Interaction: The victim must either visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious file (likely containing a crafted font).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious file or web page that contains a specially crafted embedded font.
- No special privileges or network position are explicitly mentioned, other than being able to deliver a malicious file/page to the victim

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Adobe Bridge versions 10.1.1 and earlier and 11.0.1 and earlier for Windows.
- Adobe has released updates (versions 10.1.2 and 11.0.2) to address this issue.
- This vulnerability was reported by Tran Van Khang - khangkito (VinCSS) working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
