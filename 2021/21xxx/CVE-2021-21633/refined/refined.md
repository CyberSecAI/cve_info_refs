Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21633:

**CVE-2021-21633**

*   **Root Cause:** The OWASP Dependency-Track Plugin does not enforce proper permission checks on several HTTP endpoints and does not require POST requests, leading to a CSRF vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Permission Checks:** The plugin lacks permission checks on multiple HTTP endpoints, allowing unauthorized access.
    *   **CSRF:** The affected endpoints do not require POST requests, making them susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Credentials Capture:** Attackers can exploit the missing permission checks to connect to an attacker-specified URL using credentials IDs obtained through other means. This can result in the capture of "Secret text" credentials stored in Jenkins.
    *  If no credential ID is specified, the globally configured credential will be used and can also be captured.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker with Overall/Read permission can exploit the missing permission checks.
    *   CSRF can be used by the attacker to perform actions on behalf of a victim user.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
    *   The attacker needs knowledge of valid credential IDs (which can be obtained through other vulnerabilities such as CVE-2021-21636 in the same advisory or by other means) or access to the globally configured credentials.
    *   The attacker can perform the CSRF attacks from a different domain.
