{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer truncation and integer overflow during memory allocation for parsing MPEG-4 atoms leads to undersized heap buffer allocation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Integer truncation",
    "Integer overflow",
    "Heap-based buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Memory corruption and potential code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Opening a specially crafted MPEG-4 file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must convince a user to open a malicious MPEG-4 file."
