# Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Decompiling Package Process

Moderate

[dwisiswant0](/dwisiswant0)
published
GHSA-8434-v7xw-8m9x
Mar 19, 2021

## Package

APKLeaks
(APKLeaks module)

## Affected versions

< v2.0.3

## Patched versions

v2.0.6-dev

## Description

APKLeaks prior to v2.0.3 allows remote authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via package name inside the application manifest.

### Impact

An authenticated attacker could include arguments that allow unintended commands or code to be executed, allow sensitive data to be read or modified, or could cause other unintended behavior through malicious package names.

### Patches

The problem is fixed in `v2.0.6-dev` and above.

### Workarounds

Upgrade to version 2.0.6-dev onwards.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
