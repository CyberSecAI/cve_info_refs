Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-21386:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `apkleaks` tool not properly sanitizing arguments passed to the `jadx` decompiler. Specifically, the package name from the application manifest is used as part of the command line arguments without proper escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters:** The core weakness is the failure to neutralize special characters or argument delimiters in the package name before passing it to the `os.system` function. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands.
- **OS Command Injection:** By crafting a malicious package name, an attacker can inject arbitrary operating system commands that will be executed with the privileges of the user running `apkleaks`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary OS Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands on the system where `apkleaks` is running. This can lead to various consequences such as:
  -  **Data breaches:** Access to sensitive information on the system.
  -  **System compromise:** Full control over the machine.
  -  **Denial of service:** Disrupting system operations.
  -  **Malware installation:** Introduction of malicious software.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** An attacker can use injected commands to read, modify or exfiltrate sensitive information from the system.
- **Unintended Behavior:** Injection can cause unpredictable or unintended operations through the manipulation of the operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Package Name Manipulation:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious package name within an Android application's manifest file.
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have access to an Android application that will be analyzed by `apkleaks`.
- **Authentication:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a remote, authenticated user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user and be able to supply the malicious package name within an apk file to the `apkleaks` tool.
- **Ability to Create Malicious APKs:** The attacker needs to be capable of creating or modifying an APK file containing the malicious package name in its manifest file.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content includes a fix where the `os.system()` call was replaced with the `quote` method from the python pipes library before being passed to `os.system()`.
- The vulnerability is fixed in `v2.0.6-dev` of APKLeaks.
- The advisory mentions that the attacker needs "low privileges" and "user interaction" which is not very clear since the attack vector is crafting a malicious apk to be used in the apkleaks tool.
- The vulnerability is assigned CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command) and CWE-88 (Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters)
