Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-21669

**Root Cause:** The Generic Webhook Trigger Plugin versions 1.72 and earlier do not properly configure their XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The plugin's XML parser is vulnerable to XXE injection because it does not disable external entity resolution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can exploit the XXE vulnerability to extract sensitive information and secrets from the Jenkins controller.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** By using crafted XML payloads, attackers can potentially force the Jenkins server to make requests to internal or external resources, potentially leading to further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Webhooks:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending malicious webhook requests that contain crafted XML payloads.
*   **XPath Parameter Extraction:** The vulnerability is triggered when webhooks are configured to extract parameters using XPath from XML request bodies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to trigger webhooks:** Attackers need to be able to send requests to a Jenkins instance configured to use the vulnerable Generic Webhook Trigger plugin.
*   **Knowledge of webhook configuration:** Attackers need to be aware of how the webhooks are configured to extract parameters.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in Generic Webhook Trigger Plugin version 1.74.
*   The vulnerability is identified as SECURITY-2330 within the Jenkins project.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score that is considered High.
