{
  "CVE-2021-21289": {
    "Description": "Mechanize >= v2.0, < v2.7.7 allows for OS commands to be injected using several classes' methods which implicitly use Ruby's `Kernel.open` method. Exploitation is possible only if untrusted input is used as a local filename and passed to any of these calls: `Mechanize::CookieJar#load`, `Mechanize::CookieJar#save_as`, `Mechanize#download`, `Mechanize::Download#save`, `Mechanize::Download#save!`, `Mechanize::File#save`, `Mechanize::File#save_as`, `Mechanize::FileResponse#read_body`",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to the usage of Ruby's `Kernel.open` method with untrusted input, which allows for command injection.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Command injection vulnerability in Mechanize via methods using Ruby's `Kernel.open` with untrusted file paths."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary OS commands by providing a malicious local filename as input to vulnerable methods.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Untrusted input used as a local filename is passed to vulnerable methods"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to control file paths and names passed to vulnerable methods such as `load`, `save_as`, `download`, `save`, and `read_body` in Mechanize classes.",
     "Patched versions": "2.7.7",
        "Affected versions": ">= 2.0.0, < 2.7.7",
