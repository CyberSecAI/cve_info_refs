  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflows occur in multiple parsers when handling the sizes and counts within MPEG-4 atoms. The size fields within atoms are read as 32-bit values and compared to the 64-bit size of the atom, which leads to insufficient size checks.  Multiplication operations performed on 32-bit integers when allocating memory can overflow, resulting in smaller allocations than necessary.  Later writes to these undersized allocations leads to heap-based buffer overflows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Integer overflow",
    "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Insufficient size check"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Memory corruption, leading to potential code execution under the context of the library.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted MPEG-4 input file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious MPEG-4 file."
