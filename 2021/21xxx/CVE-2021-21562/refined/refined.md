Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-21562:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an untrusted search path in Dell PowerScale OneFS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Untrusted search path: The system uses a user-provided path to execute resources, which are not under the application's direct control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code or resources not intended by the application.
-  Impacts clusters in Compliance mode.
-  The vulnerability could lead to an integrity compromise (modification of system components).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local.
- An attacker needs to provide an untrusted path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user.
- The attacker needs to have the following privileges:
   - `ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_SSH` or `ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_CONSOLE`
   - `ISI_PRIV_SYS_UPGRADE` or `ISI_PRIV_AUDIT`
- High privileges

**Additional Details:**
- Dell recommends upgrading at the earliest opportunity.
- A workaround is provided by setting the `secure_path` configuration directive in the `/etc/mcp/override/sudoers` file. This replaces the user-supplied PATH environment variable with a secure path specified in the `sudoers` configuration.
