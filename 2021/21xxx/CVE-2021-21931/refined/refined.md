The provided content describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the Advantech R-SeeNet application. Specifically, CVE-2021-21931 is related to the `stat_filter` parameter.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the misuse of prepared statements in conjunction with stored procedures and SQL concatenation. Although input parameters are sanitized using `mysqli_real_escape_string`, the protection is lost when the sanitized variables are concatenated into a SQL query, particularly within the stored procedure. The final SQL query, built within the stored procedure, is executed without specific parameter binding, making it susceptible to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- Improper neutralization of special elements in SQL commands

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries into the application's database.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, data modification or deletion, or complete database takeover.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET requests to the `/r-seenet/index.php?page=device_list` endpoint.
- The vulnerable parameter is `stat_filter`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the application as any valid user.
- Alternatively, an attacker can exploit this through a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Specific details for CVE-2021-21931:**
The `stat_filter` parameter is vulnerable.
The value of the `stat_filter` parameter is obtained from the GET request, URL-decoded, and stored in the session variable `$_SESSION['stat_filter']`.  The value is then used in an SQL query on line 604 of `device_list.php`, where it's concatenated to the query string. The code uses `mysqli_real_escape_string`, however, the query with the escaped string is then concatenated, and then passed to a stored procedure, which does not use a prepared statement with parameters and is therefore vulnerable.

The following example demonstrates an exploitation for CVE-2021-21931:
```
GET /r-seenet/index.php?page=device_list&host_filter=a&health_filter=a&desc_filter=a&loc_filter=a&prod_filter=a&stat_filter=a1%22%20AND%20(SELECT%201%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))a)--%20&firm_filter=a&sn_filter=a&mac_filter=a HTTP/1.1
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8

```
This injected SQL query will cause a 5 second delay in response due to the `SLEEP(5)` statement.
