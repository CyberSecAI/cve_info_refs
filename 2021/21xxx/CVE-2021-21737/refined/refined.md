- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient protection of the system application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Permission and access control vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can tamper with the system desktop and affect system customization functions.
- **Attack vectors**: Not explicitly stated, but the CVSS score indicates the attack vector is adjacent (AV:A).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L) on the network, and no user interaction is required (UI:N). The scope of the attack is changed (S:C), and it has a high impact on confidentiality (C:H).
