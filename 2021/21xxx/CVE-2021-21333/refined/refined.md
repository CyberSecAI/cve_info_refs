Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21333:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content includes a GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA-c5f8-35qr-q4fm) which explicitly states that it is for CVE-2021-21333. The advisory describes an HTML injection vulnerability in email and account expiry notifications in matrix-synapse versions prior to 1.27.0. The provided Fedora update notification also mentions CVE-2021-21333, confirming the relevance of this information.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the improper handling of user-controlled data within HTML templates used for generating notification emails (missed messages, account expiry). Specifically, variables within the templates were not being properly escaped before rendering as HTML, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious HTML.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **HTML Injection:** The core vulnerability is the lack of proper output encoding/escaping in Jinja2 templates, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML code.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Forged Content (Missed Messages):** In the case of missed messages notifications, an attacker could inject arbitrary HTML, potentially leading to:
    *   Phishing attacks by including malicious links that appear to be legitimate.
    *   Spoofing of content by including false information in the notification email.
    *   XSS, if the email client is rendering the HTML with JavaScript execution enabled.
*   **Account Expiry Notifications:** Although the attack surface for account expiry is less controllable (not user provided in the same way) there is still HTML injection.
*   **General Impact:** The email could be used to mislead users to interact with attacker-controlled assets.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Missed Message Notifications:** An attacker can trigger a notification email by sending a message to a room where the targeted user is a member, while they are not logged in or are set to receive email notifications. By carefully crafting the contents of the message, the attacker can inject malicious HTML.
*   **Account Expiry Notifications:** While not directly attacker controlled, the account expiry email notification system also used the same template system, hence the same type of vulnerability was present.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Missed Messages:**
    *   The attacker must be able to send a message to a room the target is a member of.
*   **Account Expiry:**
    *  The account expiry feature must be enabled and an account must be expiring.

**Additional Information from the Provided Content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Versions of matrix-synapse prior to 1.27.0 are affected.
*   **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.27.0 and later.
*   **Fix:** The fix was introduced in pull request #9200, which enabled auto-escaping by default for HTML files.
*   **Workarounds:**
    *   For missed messages, override the vulnerable templates (`notif.html`, `notif_mail.html`, `room.html`) with custom ones that manually escape variables using Jinja2's `escape` filter.
    *   For account expiry notifications, disable the feature with the `account_validity.enabled` setting or override the `notice_expiry.html` template with a custom one that manually escapes variables.
*   The vulnerability was rated as **low** severity.
*   The vulnerable template files include `add_threepid.html`, `add_threepid_failure.html`, `add_threepid_success.html`, `notice_expiry.html`, `notif_mail.html` (includes `room.html` and `notif.html`), `password_reset.html`, `password_reset_confirmation.html`, `password_reset_failure.html`, `password_reset_success.html`, `registration.html`, `registration_failure.html`, `registration_success.html`, `sso_account_deactivated.html`, `sso_auth_bad_user.html`, `sso_auth_confirm.html`, `sso_auth_success.html`, `sso_error.html`, `sso_login_idp_picker.html`, and `sso_redirect_confirm.html`

In summary, CVE-2021-21333 is due to a lack of proper escaping of user-controlled data in HTML email notification templates, allowing for HTML injection. This could lead to phishing, spoofing, or XSS if the email client is rendering the HTML with JavaScript enabled.
