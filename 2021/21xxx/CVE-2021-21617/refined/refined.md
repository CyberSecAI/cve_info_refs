Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21617:

**Root Cause:**

The Configuration Slicing Plugin did not enforce the use of POST requests for its form submission endpoint used to reconfigure slices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The absence of POST request validation makes the plugin vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can manipulate slice configurations for jobs specified by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP request to the plugin's form submission endpoint. Because it does not require a POST request, it can be performed via a GET request.
-  This requires the attacker to trick a victim into submitting the malicious request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker does not require any prior authentication or permissions on the Jenkins instance itself.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a user with a valid session in the Jenkins application to trigger the attack.
