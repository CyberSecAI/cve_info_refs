The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21917.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the misuse of prepared statements in the Advantech R-SeeNet application. Specifically, the application uses SQL concatenation in conjunction with stored procedures, which bypasses sanitization. Although variables are initially sanitized, the SQL query construction in stored procedures doesn't use parameter binding, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the 'ord' parameter of the `group_list` page.
- Improper neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands (CWE-89).

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
- Data exfiltration
- Data modification
- Privilege escalation
- Denial of service.
In the provided example, a time-based blind SQL injection is demonstrated, indicated by the use of `SLEEP(5)`, which can be used to exfiltrate data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/r-seenet/index.php` endpoint with the `page` parameter set to `group_list` and a malicious payload in the `ord` parameter.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by any authenticated user or through cross-site request forgery.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application, or needs to be able to trick another authenticated user into visiting the crafted url.
- Network access to the vulnerable application.
