Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-21899

**Description:** A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `dwgCompressor::copyCompBytes21` function of LibreCad's libdxfrw library. This vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted .dwg file.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking within the `copyCompBytes21` function. Specifically, the function copies data from a compressed buffer (`cbuf`) to a destination buffer (`dbuf`) without verifying if the destination index (`dix`) remains within the bounds of the allocated `dbuf` buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:**  The `copyCompBytes21` function can write data beyond the allocated boundary of the heap buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The length of the compressed data is read from the input file, and not properly validated before being passed to the copy function. Specifically, the function `litLength21()` can return a length value from 0x0 to 0xFFFFFFFF which is then used in the `copyCompBytes21()` function without verifying that enough memory was allocated for the copy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** A successful exploit could potentially allow an attacker to overwrite critical data on the heap, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The overflow can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File:** An attacker can craft a malicious .dwg file containing specially crafted compressed data that will trigger the overflow during the decompression process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Interaction:**  The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious .dwg file with a vulnerable version of LibreCAD or any other software using a vulnerable version of libdxfrw.

**Technical Details:**

1.  The `dwgReader21::readFileHeader` function reads the DWG file header from an offset of `0x80` bytes.
2.  It decodes part of the header, and then reads two 32-bit values which represent the compressed length of header data, which is stored in `fileHdrCompLength`.
3.  The function then allocates a buffer `fileHdrData` of a static size of `0x110` bytes.
4.  If `fileHdrCompLength` is positive, the `dwgCompressor::decompress21` function is called, passing the `fileHdrData` buffer.
5.  Within the `decompress21` function, the `litLength21()` function is called which determines the length of data to be copied based on the provided input.
6.  The `copyCompBytes21()` function then takes the calculated length, the source data, and the `fileHdrData` buffer, and copies data without checking if the destination index remains within the allocated size of `0x110` bytes, causing the heap-based buffer overflow.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability specifically affects the processing of .dwg files using the AC1021 format.
* The provided crash information shows the overflow happening within the `dwgCompressor::copyCompBytes21` function, confirming the vulnerability.
* Patches were released to address this vulnerability, as indicated by the Fedora and Debian security advisories.

This vulnerability is considered a serious issue due to its potential for arbitrary code execution. Users of vulnerable versions of LibreCAD and libdxfrw should apply the available patches immediately.
