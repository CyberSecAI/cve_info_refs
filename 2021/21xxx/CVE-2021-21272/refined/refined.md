Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21272:

**Vulnerability Description:**

The vulnerability is a path traversal issue that arises when extracting tar archives using the `oras` tool, specifically when using `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`.  It allows a malicious actor to craft a tar archive that, upon extraction, can write files outside of the intended destination directory. This is achieved using symbolic and hard links within the tar archive.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause lies in the insufficient validation of paths within tar archives during extraction. The code did not properly check symbolic and hard links for path traversal, allowing them to point to locations outside the designated target directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is path traversal. By including symbolic links (symlinks) or hard links that point outside of the intended extraction directory, an attacker can write files anywhere the user running `oras` has write permissions.
*   **Unvalidated Links:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization and validation of symbolic and hard links within the tar archive before extracting them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Write:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to write arbitrary files to the file system. This could lead to:
    *   **Overwriting critical files:** Attackers could potentially overwrite system configuration files or other important data.
    *   **Code Execution:** If an attacker is able to write files to locations where they can be executed, they could gain control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Tar Archive:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious tar archive that contains specially crafted symbolic or hard links designed to exploit the path traversal vulnerability. This malicious archive is then hosted on a container registry.
*   **Pull Operation:** The `oras pull` command is used to pull the malicious archive, triggering the vulnerability during the extraction process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious Archives:** An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious tar archive with the specific structure required to perform the path traversal.
*   **Ability to Host Malicious Archives:** The attacker needs to be able to host the malicious archive on a container registry or a location accessible by the victim.
*   **Victim must use oras pull:** The victim needs to use the `oras pull` command with a vulnerable version to retrieve the malicious archive.
*   **Victim must use FileStore:** The victim needs to use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore` to trigger the vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was addressed in `oras` version `0.9.0` by implementing more stringent checks on paths and links during tar archive extraction. The fix ensures that the extraction process is confined to the intended target directory by disallowing path traversals through links.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is similar to a "zip slip" vulnerability, but it applies to tar archives.
*   The vulnerability is present in `oras` versions `0.4.0` through `0.8.1`.
*   The fix for the vulnerability includes added checks to the path to ensure it is within the base path and that no symbolic links are present in the path.
*   The provided information includes the commit that fixes the issue, as well as the security advisory that describes the vulnerability.
