### Release highlights

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v25.0.0 that contains a security fix for the [Markdown-GFM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40ckeditor/ckeditor5-markdown-gfm). Even though this is a low impact issue and only affects the victim’s browser with no risk of data leakage, an upgrade is highly recommended! You can read more details in the relevant [security advisory](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/security/advisories/GHSA-hgmg-hhc8-g5wr) and [contact us](https://ckeditor.com/contact/) if you have more questions.

This release brings a few improvements and bug fixes:

* UX improvements to editing around the block boundaries ([#8137](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8137), [#7636](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7636)).
* [Formatting large content will not freeze the editor](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8188).
* [Uploading Base64 images will no longer cause a CSP violation](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7957).
* [Unlinking an image will not crash the editor anymore](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8401).
