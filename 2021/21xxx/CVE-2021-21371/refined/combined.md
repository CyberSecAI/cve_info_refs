# Execution of untrusted code through config file

Moderate

[SteveMcGrath](/SteveMcGrath)
published
GHSA-8278-88vv-x98r
Mar 6, 2021

## Package

pip

tenable-jira-cloud
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<1.1.21

## Patched versions

1.1.21

## Description

### Impact

It is possible to run arbitrary commands through the yaml.load() method. This could allow an attacker with local access to the host to run arbitrary code by running the application with a specially crafted YAML configuration file.

### Patches

1.1.21 [Code changes](https://github.com/tenable/integration-jira-cloud/compare/1.1.20...1.1.21)

### Workarounds

Manually adjust yaml.load() to yaml.safe\_load()

### References

<https://pyyaml.docsforge.com/master/documentation/#loading-yaml>
