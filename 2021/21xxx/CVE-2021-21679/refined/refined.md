Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-21679:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Azure AD Plugin implements an extension point in Jenkins that allows selectively disabling CSRF protection for specific URLs. This is done for URLs used by a JavaScript component within the plugin.
- The implementation in versions 179.vf6841393099e and earlier is too permissive, disabling CSRF protection for a wider range of URLs than intended.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient CSRF Protection:** The plugin improperly handles CSRF protection, allowing it to be bypassed. Specifically, it disables CSRF protection for URLs used by a JavaScript component, but this implementation is too broad.
- **Overly Permissive Implementation**:  The extension point meant for selective CSRF disabling is implemented too permissively, allowing CSRF protection bypass on any target URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **CSRF Bypass:** Attackers can craft URLs that bypass CSRF protection. This can allow an attacker to perform actions as a logged-in user without their knowledge.
- **Potential for arbitrary actions:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to perform any action a victim could perform, such as changing user settings, initiating builds, or accessing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted URLs:** Attackers would need to craft malicious URLs that would be clicked or otherwise used by a logged-in user.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers likely need to use social engineering or other methods to trick a victim into accessing the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted URLs to a user within the Jenkins environment.
- **Knowledge of Jenkins:** The attacker needs to understand how Jenkins' CSRF protection works and how the Azure AD plugin implements it.
- **User Interaction:**  The attack requires a victim user to interact with the malicious URL.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in Azure AD Plugin 164.v5b48baa961d2.
- The fix involves reconfiguring the javascript component to pass CSRF tokens, rather than disabling CSRF for its URLs.
- The severity is rated as High.
