This document describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities affecting the Advantech R-SeeNet application. CVE-2021-21932 is one of the listed vulnerabilities, specifically related to the 'name_filter' parameter.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the misuse of prepared statements, stored procedures, and SQL concatenation within the application. Input sanitization is circumvented when variables used to build an SQL query are invoked against the database due to a lack of specific parameter binding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: Specifically, the application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `name_filter` parameter. The application uses `mysqli_real_escape_string` for sanitization, but the protection is lost when the sanitized string is concatenated into the SQL query using `CONCAT` within the stored procedure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to:
- Data exfiltration
- Data modification
- Denial of service
- Complete database compromise

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests to the `/r-seenet/index.php?page=device_list` page.
- The vulnerable parameter is `name_filter`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user. This can be achieved through a valid login or through cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application.
