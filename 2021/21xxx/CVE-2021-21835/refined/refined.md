The provided content is a Talos vulnerability report that includes details for CVE-2021-21835.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is an integer overflow in the `csgp_box_read` function when processing an atom with the "csgp" FOURCC code. Specifically, a multiplication is performed using a 32-bit integer, which results in an undersized memory allocation. Later writes to this undersized buffer lead to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Integer overflow:** The code multiplies the `pattern_count` with `sizeof(GF_CompactSampleGroupPattern)` without checking if the result exceeds the maximum value of the used data type (32bit), leading to a smaller memory allocation than required.
*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** After the undersized heap allocation, the code proceeds to write data into this buffer which exceeds the allocated size, causing a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Memory corruption:** Exploitation of the integer overflow leads to memory corruption due to the heap-based buffer overflow. This can potentially allow arbitrary code execution in the context of the application utilizing the vulnerable library.
*   **Code Execution:** As stated in the details, the vulnerability can result in code execution under the context of the library.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted MPEG-4 file containing a malicious "csgp" atom.
*   An attacker can convince a user to open a crafted video file, which will trigger the vulnerable code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to create a malicious MPEG-4 file with a crafted "csgp" atom.
*   The attacker needs to deliver the malicious file to the target and convince the user to open it with an application using the vulnerable GPAC library.

**Additional details from the report:**

*   The report provides the specific code locations where the vulnerabilities exist along with example crash information.
*   The report provides a detailed explanation of the GPAC library, its usage, and how the MPEG-4 container format is processed.
*   The report details the steps taken in the parsing process where the integer overflow and subsequent buffer overflow occur.
*   It mentions that the vulnerability can be exploited on 32-bit systems due to the integer overflow behavior.
*   It lists the specific versions and commit of GPAC affected.
*   It includes the CVSSv3 score of 8.8 which indicates a high severity vulnerability.
