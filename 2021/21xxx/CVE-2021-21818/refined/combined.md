##### CVE Number

CVE-2021-21818

## Summary

A hard-coded password vulnerability exists in the Zebra IP Routing Manager functionality of D-LINK DIR-3040 1.13B03. A specially crafted network request can lead to a denial of service. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

### Details

The DIR-3040 is an AC3000-based wireless internet router.

Zebra is an IP routing manager that provides kernel routing table updates, interface lookups, and redistribution of routes between different routing protocols.

The DIR-3040 runs this service by default on TCP port 2601 and can be accessed by anyone on the network. This service also uses a configuration file containing a hard-coded password `zebra`:

```
admin@dlinkrouter:~# cat /tmp/zebra.conf
hostname Router
password zebra
enable password zebra

```
