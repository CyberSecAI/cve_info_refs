- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The D-Link DIR-3040 router uses a hardcoded password "zebra" for the Zebra IP Routing Manager service. This service is accessible on TCP port 2601 and allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    -   Hardcoded password in the Zebra routing service configuration file `/tmp/zebra.conf`.
    -   Lack of access control on the Zebra service running on TCP port 2601 allowing connections from any network user.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    -   An attacker can gain access to the Zebra routing service by using the hardcoded password, potentially leading to further compromise of the router or the network.
    - The vulnerability can lead to denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**:
    -   Network-based attack.
    -   Attacker establishes a telnet connection to the router on TCP port 2601.
    -   The attacker authenticates using the hardcoded password "zebra" to gain access to the Zebra service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    -   The attacker needs to be on the same network as the router.
    -   The attacker needs to have the ability to establish a telnet connection on TCP port 2601.
