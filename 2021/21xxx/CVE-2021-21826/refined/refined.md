{
  "CVE-2021-21826": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a heap buffer overflow in the `DecodeTreeBlock` function when handling whitespace tokens. A `UINT32` value, loaded from the input file, is used as a length parameter for a subsequent memcpy operation without proper bounds checking.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker can craft a malicious XMI file that, when processed by Xdemill, triggers the overflow, allowing for arbitrary code to be executed.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A specially crafted XMI file can be provided to the vulnerable application."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious XMI file to a system that uses the vulnerable Xdemill utility, or a product that incorporates it like Schneider Electric's EcoStruxure Control Expert."

    "root_cause": "This vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in `DecodeTreeBlock` when handling attribute whitespace tokens.  A `UINT32` value read from the file is used as a size for a memcpy without proper checks.",

  "CVE-2021-21828": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `CurPath::AddLabel` function, which is called by `DecodeTreeBlock`.  This function increments a global pointer to store `TLabelID` values without proper bounds checking. This can overwrite memory outside of the allocated buffer, potentially allowing an attacker to control the instruction pointer.",
