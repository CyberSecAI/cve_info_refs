```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to misuse of prepared statements and stored procedures combined with SQL concatenation. Variables used to build up an SQL query, despite being initially sanitized, lose that protection when invoked against the database. The final prepared statement is taken directly from the @sql variable without specific parameter bindings, leading to SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. The provided examples show that it is possible to execute arbitrary SQL queries, such as time-based blind SQL injection using `SLEEP()` function.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET requests to the `/r-seenet/index.php?page=device_list` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `health_alt_filter` parameter. The application processes this request and constructs a vulnerable SQL query using unsanitized input.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user. This can be achieved as any authenticated user or through cross-site request forgery."
