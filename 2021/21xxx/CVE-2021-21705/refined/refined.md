Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-21705:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the `userinfo` component (which includes username and password) within URLs when using the `FILTER_VALIDATE_URL` filter in PHP.
- Specifically, the filter was not correctly enforcing the rules defined in RFC 3986 regarding allowed characters in the `userinfo` portion of a URL.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SSRF Bypass:** The primary weakness is that malformed URLs with invalid characters in the username or password can bypass the `FILTER_VALIDATE_URL` check, leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
-   **Incorrect Host Parsing:** When invalid characters are present in the userinfo section before the "@" symbol, `parse_url()` function can parse the host incorrectly.
- **Open Redirect:** The vulnerability can be exploited to create open redirects. A crafted URL with an invalid username or password might be parsed correctly by `filter_var()` with the `FILTER_VALIDATE_URL` filter, but interpreted differently by browsers, leading to an attacker-controlled redirect.
-   **Bypass of SSRF Protections:** By exploiting the inconsistency between how PHP and browsers interpret invalid URLs, attackers can bypass SSRF mitigations that rely on validating the host via `parse_url()`.
- **file_get_contents vulnerability** If file_get_contents is used over username and password, a crafted URL will be parsed incorrectly by php, and the request will be sent to unexpected resource.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Bypassed Security Checks:** Attackers can bypass security checks relying on `FILTER_VALIDATE_URL`, potentially leading to various other vulnerabilities.
- **Open Redirects:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious sites by crafting URLs that are valid for `filter_var` but redirect to a different host on the browser.
- **SSRF:** Attackers can trick the server into making requests to unintended resources due to the inconsistencies in URL parsing.
- **Information disclosure:** By utilizing `file_get_contents` to access unexpected resources on local network.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted URLs:** Attackers craft URLs with specific invalid characters within the `userinfo` section.
- **GET parameters:** URLs are passed through GET request, such as `$_GET['url']` , `$_GET['user']` and `$_GET['pass']`.
- **file_get_contents:** The URL can be passed into `file_get_contents`.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to control URL that's being validated by the vulnerable code
-   The attacker needs to be able to control username and password in URLs.
-   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests on the server.

**Technical Details from the Content:**

-   The issue arises from the way `parse_url()` and `FILTER_VALIDATE_URL` handle user information in URLs, especially regarding characters like `\` (backslash), `:`, `@` and `/`.
-   The fix involves enforcing RFC 3986 standards for `userinfo`, specifically regarding allowable characters.
-   The fix was applied to the `ext/filter/logical_filters.c` file and included a new test in `ext/filter/tests/bug81122.phpt`.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is specific to PHP versions prior to the fix which was backported to PHP 7.3, 7.4 and 8.0 branches.
- The issue was related to how  `FILTER_VALIDATE_URL` was validating URLs, rather than to any fundamental flaws in the core `parse_url()` itself which only breaks it up into the listed parts.

The provided content includes various discussions and code changes, demonstrating the process of identifying, understanding, and fixing the vulnerability. It also highlights how seemingly minor discrepancies in URL parsing can lead to serious security vulnerabilities.
