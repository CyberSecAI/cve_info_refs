- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The iDRAC9 versions prior to 4.40.10.00 have multiple stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities when generating a certificate.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious user with high privileges can store malicious HTML or JavaScript code. When victim users access the stored data through their browsers, the malicious code is executed within the context of the vulnerable web application, potentially leading to information disclosure, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote authenticated attacker with high privileges can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code through affected parameters while generating a certificate.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user with high privileges. They must be able to inject malicious code through the affected certificate generation process.
