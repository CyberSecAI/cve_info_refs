Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21624:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin does not correctly perform permission checks to determine whether an item should be accessible. Specifically, it fails to verify if a user has the necessary permissions for parent folders when checking access to nested items.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Permission Checks:** The plugin doesn't enforce the expected hierarchical permission model where access to a nested item should be contingent on having access to all its parent folders.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker with `Item/Read` permission on a nested item can access that item even if they lack the required `Item/Read` permission on the parent folders. This allows bypassing intended access control restrictions.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to jobs and other resources that they are not intended to see.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** This vulnerability is exploitable via network access to the Jenkins instance.
*   **Manipulating Permissions:** An attacker would need to have a legitimate user account with `Item/Read` permission on a nested item.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privilege Account:** The attacker needs a user account in the Jenkins instance with `Item/Read` permissions on at least one nested item.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make network requests to the Jenkins instance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin versions 3.1 and earlier.
*   The fix is included in version 3.1.1 and later.
*   A workaround is to avoid granting permissions on individual items to users who lack permissions on parent items.
*   The fix can be disabled by setting the Java system property `com.michelin.cio.hudson.plugins.rolestrategy.RoleMap.checkParentPermissions` to `false`.
