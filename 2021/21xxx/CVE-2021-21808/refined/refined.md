{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing bounds check in the `png_palette_process` function when processing a specially crafted PNG file. Specifically, when the color type is 3 and bit depth is 2,  the function writes two bytes into a buffer, without verifying if the buffer is large enough to hold two bytes. This leads to an out-of-bounds write and a heap buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Heap buffer overflow",
    "Out-of-bounds write",
    "Missing bounds check"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit can lead to a heap corruption, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted, malformed PNG file to the vulnerable software.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the vulnerable application which processes the malformed PNG image."
