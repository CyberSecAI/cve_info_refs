# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Check basic auth result against != NGX\_OK rather than == NGX\_DECLINED

[Browse files](/stnoonan/spnego-http-auth-nginx-module/tree/a06f9efca373e25328b1c53639a48decd0854570)

```
This corrects the error handling case when ngx_http_auth_spnego_basic is called with a bad configuration or bad username. These cases return NGX_ERROR, which allowed basic auth to proceed.

Thanks to Prakapovich Pavel aka Flyguy.by for pointing this out.
