Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21335:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect check in the `ngx_http_auth_spnego_handler` function within the `spnego-http-auth-nginx-module`. Specifically, the code was checking if `ngx_http_auth_spnego_basic` returned `NGX_DECLINED` to determine if basic authentication failed. However, `ngx_http_auth_spnego_basic` could also return `NGX_ERROR` in cases of bad configuration or a malformed username, which was not being properly handled. This resulted in a bypass of the intended authentication process, allowing a user to potentially gain access without valid credentials, if the basic auth is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Error Handling:** The code incorrectly assumed that only `NGX_DECLINED` indicated a failure of basic authentication.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the basic authentication mechanism by providing a malformed username that would cause the `ngx_http_auth_spnego_basic` function to return `NGX_ERROR`, which was not treated as a failure, thus, skipping SPNEGO authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can bypass basic authentication, potentially gaining unauthorized access to resources protected by the module.
*   **Confidentiality Impact:** This vulnerability has a low impact on confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send a malformed HTTP request to the affected server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker doesn't need any prior privileges on the system.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** The attack can be performed without any user interaction.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server, which must have basic authentication enabled.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in version 1.1.1 of the module.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 5.3.

**Summary**
The vulnerability is an authentication bypass due to incorrect error handling in the basic authentication logic. The module incorrectly used `NGX_DECLINED` as the only failure return, causing a bypass of authentication when encountering `NGX_ERROR`. The fix is a single-line change that checks for `!= NGX_OK` instead of `== NGX_DECLINED` .
