Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21670:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper permission checks within Jenkins. Specifically, users with `Item/Cancel` permission could cancel queue items and abort builds even if they lacked `Item/Read` permission.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The core weakness is that the system didn't correctly enforce the requirement for `Item/Read` permission alongside `Item/Cancel` when performing cancel/abort operations. This allowed users with lesser privileges to disrupt build processes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (Limited):** Attackers could cancel pending builds and abort ongoing builds for jobs even if they didn't have read permissions. This would cause disruption to the CI/CD pipelines managed by Jenkins. The impact is not catastrophic, but could hinder development and deployment processes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker with access to the Jenkins instance.
*   **Exploitable permissions:** An attacker requires `Item/Cancel` permission for the targeted jobs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the Jenkins instance.
*   The attacker has to be granted `Item/Cancel` permissions for the jobs.
*  The attacker does not have `Item/Read` permission.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information states that the fix requires that users have `Item/Read` permission for applicable types in addition to `Item/Cancel` permission to cancel jobs.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity.
*   A workaround for earlier Jenkins versions is to not grant `Item/Cancel` permission to users without `Item/Read` permission.
