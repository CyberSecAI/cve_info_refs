The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21862.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Integer overflow and truncation vulnerabilities within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** In the `xtra_box_read` function, a 32-bit unsigned integer representing the name size is read from the input, and then 1 is added to it. If the name size is close to the maximum value of a 32-bit unsigned integer, the addition can cause an integer overflow, resulting in a much smaller value.
- **Integer Truncation:** The library truncates 64-bit sizes to 32 bits for allocation purposes which can lead to undersized allocations.
- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** Due to the integer overflow/truncation and undersized allocation, the library attempts to write data into a smaller buffer than intended, causing a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption
- Potential code execution under the context of the library

**Attack vectors:**
- A specially crafted MPEG-4 input file.
- An attacker can convince a user to open the malicious video file with a vulnerable application using the GPAC library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to craft a malicious MPEG-4 file
- Ability to convince a user to open the malicious file.
