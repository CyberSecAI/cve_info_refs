The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities, and one of them is related to CVE-2021-21609.

**CVE-2021-21609**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Jenkins does not correctly compare requested URLs with a static list of URLs that are always accessible even without Overall/Read permission.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing permission check for paths with specific prefixes.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers without Overall/Read permission can access plugin-provided URLs with specific prefixes, potentially exposing sensitive information or functionality.
*   **Attack vectors**: Network access to Jenkins instance.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the Jenkins instance. They do not need Overall/Read permission. They would need a plugin that exposes URLs with the vulnerable prefixes.

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description, by listing the vulnerable prefixes and giving an example of how a plugin could be exploited.
