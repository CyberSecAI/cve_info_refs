- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A double-free vulnerability exists due to a reference to a timeout object being stored in two different locations without proper reference counting. This occurs when the application registers a JavaScript callback using `setInterval` or `setTimeout` and also stores a reference to the same object in a global array. When the application closes the document, the object is freed twice.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Double-free vulnerability (CWE-415) in the way Nitro Pro PDF manages JavaScript timeout objects. Lack of proper reference counting when storing timeout objects in multiple locations.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Code execution under the context of the application.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can craft a malicious PDF document containing JavaScript code that leverages the `setInterval` or `setTimeout` methods to trigger the double-free condition, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious PDF document. No specific position or capabilities are required beyond the ability to create and deliver a PDF document.
