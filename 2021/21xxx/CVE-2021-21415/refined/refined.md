Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21415:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Prisma VS Code extension executing a custom binary specified by the user via the "prismaFmtBinPath" setting in VS Code's settings.json. This occurs when auto-formatting is triggered or when validation checks run after each keypress on a `.prisma` file.  The extension does not validate the binary path or the binary, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unvalidated Binary Execution:** The core vulnerability is the lack of validation of the custom binary path and the binary itself before execution. The extension blindly executes whatever is specified in the `prismaFmtBinPath` setting.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By crafting a malicious binary and tricking a user into using it by setting the `prismaFmtBinPath` setting, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. This could allow an attacker to:
    *   Install malware
    *   Steal sensitive data
    *   Compromise the user's system
    *   Perform other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Settings File:** The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a project containing a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file that specifies a malicious custom binary path.
*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker could also convince a user to manually set a malicious path in their VS Code settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft a Malicious Binary:** The attacker needs to create a malicious executable that will be executed when the Prisma extension is triggered.
*   **Ability to Influence User's Settings:**  The attacker needs to get the user to either open a project containing a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file, or convince them to manually set the `prismaFmtBinPath` to a malicious binary.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in versions 2.20.0 and later of the Prisma VS Code extension, as well as version 20.0.27 and later of the Prisma-Insider extension.
*   The provided content references a pull request (#750) that introduced a fix which includes explicit allow prompts for custom binaries, as a mitigation for this issue.
*   This vulnerability is similar to the CVE-2021-27081 which affected the ESLint extension in VS Code.

The vulnerability is classified as high severity, with a CVSS score of 7.8.
