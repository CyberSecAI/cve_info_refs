```
Root cause of vulnerability: Insufficient policy enforcement in the File System API within the Chromium browser.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The File System API does not properly enforce security policies, leading to potential unauthorized access or manipulation of the file system.

Impact of exploitation: Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass intended security restrictions and potentially gain access to sensitive files or manipulate the file system in unexpected ways.

Attack vectors: The attack vector is through a malicious website or application that utilizes the File System API in Chromium.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker would need to be able to convince a user to visit a malicious website or run a malicious application in a Chromium based browser that leverages the File System API.
