The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21602.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The file browser for workspaces, archived artifacts, and `$JENKINS_HOME/userContent/` follows symbolic links to locations outside the directory being browsed. This is due to an incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability (SECURITY-904 / CVE-2018-1000862).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure handling of symbolic links in workspace browsers

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file read vulnerability, allowing access to files outside the intended browsing directory

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with Job/Workspace permission and the ability to control workspace contents (e.g., with Job/Configure permission or the ability to change SCM contents) can create symbolic links that point to files outside the workspace, accessible via the workspace browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Requires Job/Workspace permission
- Ability to control workspace contents (e.g., Job/Configure permission or ability to change SCM contents)
