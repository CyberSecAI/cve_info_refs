- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect default permissions on the installation directory of Advantech R-SeeNet.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The "Authenticated Users" group has "Full/Change" privileges over the `SnmpMonSvs` service binary file (`R_SeeNet.exe`) located in the installation directory (`C:\R-SeeNet`). This allows any authenticated user to modify the binary file. The service is executed with NT SYSTEM privileges, leading to privilege escalation if the binary is replaced.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve NT SYSTEM level privileges by replacing the legitimate `SnmpMonSvs` service binary with a malicious one and restarting the service. This allows the attacker to perform any operation on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the machine with an authenticated user account.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system where Advantech R-SeeNet is installed.
