Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-21291

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way the `oauth2-proxy` application validates redirect URLs against a configured whitelist of domains. The code incorrectly checks if a redirect URL's hostname ends with a whitelisted domain, without ensuring it's a proper subdomain match. This allows an attacker to craft redirect URLs with hostnames that simply *end* with a whitelisted domain, bypassing the intended security check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate the redirect URL against the whitelist domains, leading to unintended redirects.
- **Insecure Domain Matching:** The subdomain matching logic is flawed, allowing partial matches. Instead of checking for a proper subdomain (e.g., `sub.example.com`), it allows any hostname that ends with the whitelisted domain string (e.g., `badexample.com`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Open Redirect:** An attacker can craft a malicious redirect URL that bypasses the whitelist check.
- **Phishing:** This can be used to redirect users to malicious websites, potentially leading to phishing attacks.
- **Bypassing Authentication:** In some scenarios, an open redirect could be exploited to bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious actor would need to craft a URL to the `oauth2-proxy` service with a redirect parameter that contains a hostname that ends with a whitelisted domain.
- This crafted URL would be passed to the `IsValidRedirect` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the `oauth2-proxy` service.
- The attacker needs to know the whitelisted domain(s).
- The attacker does not need to have valid credentials to exploit the open redirect vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `IsValidRedirect` function within the `oauthproxy.go` file.
- Specifically, the issue lies in this line: `if (redirectHostname == domainHostname) || (strings.HasPrefix(domain, ".") && strings.HasSuffix(redirectHostname, domainHostname)) {`
- The fix is to ensure that if `domain` starts with a ".", the code should verify that `redirectHostname` ends with `"." + domainHostname`.

**Affected Versions:**
- Versions 3.0.0 up to (but not including) 6.1.1 of `oauth2-proxy` are vulnerable.

**Patched Versions:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 7.0.0 and later.

**Additional Information:**
- The advisory includes a reproducer code snippet in Go, demonstrating how the flawed domain matching logic can be exploited.
- The advisory suggests workarounds, such as disabling the whitelist domain feature or running separate instances for each subdomain.
