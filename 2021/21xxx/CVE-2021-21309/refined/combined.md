### @yossigo **[yossigo](/yossigo)** commented [Feb 22, 2021](#issue-813346549) • edited Loading

On 32-bit systems, setting the `proto-max-bulk-len` config parameter to a high value may result with integer overflow and a subsequent heap overflow when parsing an input bulk (CVE-2021-21309).

This fix has two parts:

* Set a reasonable limit to the config parameter.
* Add additional checks to prevent the problem in other potential but unknown code paths.

Sorry, something went wrong.

`[5054518](/Crispy-fried-chicken/redis/commit/5054518af4e3f4d0179f41935f2b0c92350914a1)`

```
Fix integer overflow (CVE-2021-21309). ([redis#8522](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/8522))
On 32-bit systems, setting the proto-max-bulk-len config parameter to a high value may result with integer overflow and a subsequent heap overflow when parsing an input bulk (CVE-2021-21309).

This fix has two parts:

Set a reasonable limit to the config parameter.
Add additional checks to prevent the problem in other potential but unknown code paths.

# Integer overflow on 32-bit systems

High

[yossigo](/yossigo)
published
GHSA-hgj8-vff2-7cjf
Feb 23, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

>= 4.0 (32-bit only)

## Patched versions

6.0.11, 5.0.11, 6.2

## Description

### Impact

An integer overflow bug in 32-bit Redis version 4.0 or newer could be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution.

Redis 4.0 or newer uses a configurable limit for the maximum supported bulk input size. By default, it is 512MB which is a safe value for all platforms.

If the limit is significantly increased, receiving a large request from a client may trigger several integer overflow scenarios, which would result with buffer overflow and heap corruption. We believe this could in certain conditions be exploited for remote code execution.

By default, authenticated Redis users have access to all configuration parameters and can therefore use the “CONFIG SET proto-max-bulk-len” to change the safe default, making the system vulnerable.

**This problem only affects 32-bit Redis (on a 32-bit system, or as a 32-bit executable running on a 64-bit system).**

### Patches

The problem is fixed in version 6.2, and the fix is back ported to 6.0.11 and 5.0.11. Make sure you use one of these versions if you're running 32-bit Redis.

### Workarounds

An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent clients from directly executing `CONFIG SET`:

* Using Redis 6.0 or newer, ACL configuration can be used to block the command.
* Using older versions, the `rename-command` configuration directive can be used to rename the command to a random string unknown to users, rendering it inaccessible.

Please note that this workaround may have an additional impact on users or operational systems that expect `CONFIG SET` to behave in certain ways.

### Credits

The problem was reported by Omri Ben-Bassat of Section 52 at Azure Defender for IoT, Microsoft Corp.

# Redis: Remote code execution — GLSA **202103-02**

A vulnerability in Redis could lead to remote code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/redis** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **6.0.12** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.0.12**>= **6.0.12** |

### Background

Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store,
used as a database, cache and message broker.

### Description

It was discovered that there were a number of integer overflow issues in
Redis.

### Impact

A remote attacker, able to connect to a Redis instance, could send a
malicious crafted large request possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or a Denial of Service
condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Redis 5.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/redis-5.0.12"

```

All Redis 6.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/redis-6.0.12"

```
