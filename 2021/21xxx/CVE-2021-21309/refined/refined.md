Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21309:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow in the handling of the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter on 32-bit systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** Setting the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter to a high value on 32-bit systems could lead to an integer overflow.
- **Heap Overflow:** The integer overflow results in an undersized memory allocation that allows a subsequent heap overflow when parsing a large input bulk from a client.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Heap Corruption:** The heap overflow corrupts the heap memory.
- **Remote Code Execution (Potential):** The heap corruption could potentially lead to remote code execution.
- **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability could lead to a denial of service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** A remote attacker can connect to the Redis instance and send a malicious large request.
- **Configuration Manipulation:** An authenticated Redis user can change the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration using `CONFIG SET`, making the system vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Redis instance.
- **Authenticated User (Potentially):**  If the default `proto-max-bulk-len` is not modified, the attacker needs to be an authenticated user to change the `proto-max-bulk-len` config via the `CONFIG SET` command.
- **32-bit System:** The vulnerability is specific to 32-bit systems (or 32-bit Redis executable on a 64-bit system).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Redis versions 4.0 and later (32-bit only).
- The fix includes setting a reasonable limit to the `proto-max-bulk-len` config parameter and adding additional checks to prevent the problem in other potential code paths.
- The fix is backported to versions 6.0.11 and 5.0.11.
- Workarounds include blocking the `CONFIG SET` command using ACL configuration (Redis 6.0+) or renaming the command using `rename-command` (older versions).
- The vulnerability was reported by Omri Ben-Bassat of Section 52 at Azure Defender for IoT, Microsoft Corp.
- Patched versions are 6.0.11, 5.0.11, and 6.2.
