Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-21339

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the storage of user session identifiers in cleartext within TYPO3 CMS. These session identifiers were not processed with any additional cryptographic hashing algorithms before storage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the **sensitive data exposure** due to the lack of cryptographic protection for session identifiers. This corresponds to **CWE-312** (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The direct impact of this vulnerability is limited. It can't be exploited on its own. However, if combined with a chained attack, such as a SQL injection vulnerability in another part of the system, an attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive session data. This could lead to session hijacking and further compromise of the system. The severity is rated as **high**, due to the potential for high impact in the presence of a chained attack

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is indirect. An attacker would first need to exploit another vulnerability (like SQL injection) in the system to gain access to the cleartext session identifiers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to:
1. Exploit an existing vulnerability in the TYPO3 CMS (e.g. SQL Injection) or other system components.
2. Have the ability to read the cleartext stored session identifiers after exploiting the other vulnerability.

**Affected Versions:**
- 6.2.0-6.2.56
- 7.0.0-7.6.50
- 8.0.0-8.7.39
- 9.0.0-9.5.24
