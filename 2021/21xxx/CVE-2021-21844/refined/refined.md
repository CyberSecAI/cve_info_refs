  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the `stco_box_read` function when calculating the size of the buffer to allocate for chunk offsets.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Heap-based Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A specially crafted MPEG-4 input can cause an integer overflow, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow, leading to memory corruption and potentially code execution under the context of the library.",
    "attack_vectors": "By convincing a user to open a malicious MPEG-4 file.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious MPEG-4 file that exploits the integer overflow in the `stco_box_read` function to cause a buffer overflow when processing the `stco` atom. The user needs to open this file using the vulnerable library."
