Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-21637:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Team Foundation Server Plugin 5.157.1 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing permission check: The plugin fails to validate user permissions before accessing a specific HTTP endpoint.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The affected HTTP endpoint does not require POST requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs, leading to the capture of credentials stored in Jenkins.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can exploit the missing permission check by accessing the vulnerable HTTP endpoint without proper authorization.
- The CSRF vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a user into submitting a request to the vulnerable endpoint, allowing the attacker to capture credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs Overall/Read permission within the Jenkins environment.
- The attacker must have knowledge of credentials IDs stored in Jenkins (obtained through another method, possibly CVE-2021-21636 which allows enumeration of credentials IDs).
