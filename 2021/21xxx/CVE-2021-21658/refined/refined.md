Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21658:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Nuget Plugin (versions 1.0 and earlier) does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks when processing the `packages.config` file for the "Build on NuGet updates" feature.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The plugin's XML parser is vulnerable to XXE attacks because it does not disable external entity resolution. This allows an attacker to inject malicious XML code that references external resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Extraction of Secrets:** An attacker can exploit the XXE vulnerability to extract sensitive information (secrets) from the Jenkins controller.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker can force the Jenkins server to make requests to other servers (internal or external) via crafted XML external entities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through manipulation of the `packages.config` file within a Jenkins workspace.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to control the contents of the `packages.config` file:** The attacker must be able to modify the `packages.config` file in a Jenkins job's workspace. This implies that the attacker has some level of access to the Jenkins environment. Specifically, the advisory states "attackers with the ability to control the contents of the `packages.config` file in a workspace".
- No user interaction is required for exploitation.
- The attacker does not necessarily need Job/Configure permission.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the "Build on NuGet updates" feature of the Nuget Plugin.
- The fix for this vulnerability is available in Nuget Plugin version 1.1, which disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.
