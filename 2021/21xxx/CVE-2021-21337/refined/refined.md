{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of the `came_from` parameter in the `CookieAuthHelper` plugin. This parameter is used for redirection after login, and if not sanitized, an attacker can provide a malicious URL and redirect the victim to an untrusted site.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Open redirect vulnerability",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can craft a malicious link to the login form that, upon successful login, redirects the user to a website controlled by the attacker. This can be used for phishing attacks, credential theft, or malware distribution.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a maliciously crafted URL that includes a malicious `came_from` parameter, which can be appended to the login URL.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to craft a URL with the malicious `came_from` parameter and distribute the link to potential victims. No other special capabilities or positions are required."
