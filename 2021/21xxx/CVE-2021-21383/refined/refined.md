Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-21383:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that Wiki.js was parsing mustache expressions within `<pre>` tags during content injection.  Although the `<pre>` tag is intended to display code as is, the rendering engine was still processing mustache templating syntax within these tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution: An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a wiki page. When other users view the compromised page, the malicious JavaScript would execute within their browsers. This could lead to a variety of attacks, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Cookie theft
    - Defacement of the website
    - Phishing attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted Wiki Page: An attacker needs to create or modify a wiki page, inserting a malicious code block containing mustache expressions that will execute JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated Wiki.js User: The attacker needs to be a user with the ability to create or edit wiki pages on a vulnerable Wiki.js instance.
- Markdown knowledge: the attacker needs to know how to create markdown code blocks

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was present in Wiki.js versions prior to 2.5.190.
- The fix for this vulnerability was implemented in commit `5ffa189` by adding the `v-pre` directive to all `<pre>` tags during the rendering process, which tells Vue to ignore mustache syntax inside of them.
- This commit was included in version 2.5.191.
- The reported was  Mina M. Edwar.
