{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how the Syncthing relay protocol handles messages with a negative length field.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A malformed relay protocol message with a negative length field can cause both the `syncthing` client and `strelaysrv` relay server to crash and exit.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious relay server sending a crafted message to a syncthing client.",
       "A malicious client sending crafted messages to the relay server."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the syncthing client or relay server.",
       "For the syncthing client, the attacker needs to lure it to connect to a malicious relay server."
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered by a negative length field in the relay protocol message. The issue does not expose sensitive data and requires the Syncthing client to connect to a malicious relay server. It was fixed by adding a check for negative message length."
