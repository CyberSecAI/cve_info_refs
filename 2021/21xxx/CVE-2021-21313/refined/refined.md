Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21313:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `/ajax/common.tabs.php` endpoint in GLPI. The parameters `_target` and `id` are not properly sanitized before being used, which allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
  - Stealing session cookies.
  - Defacing the web page.
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
  - Accessing sensitive data within the GLPI application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is triggered through a crafted URL targeting `/ajax/common.tabs.php`.
- The malicious code is injected via the `_target` and `id` parameters.
- Two specific payloads are mentioned:
    - A payload using `_target` parameter with javascript:alert to trigger an alert when clicking a button.
    - A payload using the `id` parameter to execute javascript code directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs containing malicious JavaScript code and entice a user to access the crafted URL.
- The user needs to be logged into GLPI for the attack to be effective, as the attacker exploits the user's browser session within the context of the GLPI web application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is described as a "Moderate" severity.
- The vulnerability is present in GLPI versions prior to 9.5.4 and is fixed in version 9.5.4.
- The provided content includes two distinct payloads to exploit the XSS vulnerability.
- The patch was part of a larger security release, which included multiple other security fixes.
