| [Description](#c0)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-02-04 03:03:47 UTC  ``` CVE-2021-21284 (<https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-7452-xqpj-6rpc>):  In Docker before versions 9.03.15, 20.10.3 there is a vulnerability involving the --userns-remap option in which access to remapped root allows privilege escalation to real root. When using "--userns-remap", if the root user in the remapped namespace has access to the host filesystem they can modify files under "/var/lib/docker/<remapping>" that cause writing files with extended privileges. Versions 20.10.3 and 19.03.15 contain patches that prevent privilege escalation from remapped user.  CVE-2021-21285 (<https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-6fj5-m822-rqx8>):  In Docker before versions 9.03.15, 20.10.3 there is a vulnerability in which pulling an intentionally malformed Docker image manifest crashes the dockerd daemon. Versions 20.10.3 and 19.03.15 contain patches that prevent the daemon from crashing.   Please bump to 19.03.15 and 20.10.3. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Larry the Git Cow   gentoo-dev  2021-02-04 15:06:17 UTC  ``` The bug has been referenced in the following commit(s):  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=a61c65ac049a905f70fdd3771946816c4d265b36>  commit a61c65ac049a905f70fdd3771946816c4d265b36 Author:     William Hubbs <williamh@gentoo.org> AuthorDate: 2021-02-04 15:05:56 +0000 Commit:     William Hubbs <williamh@gentoo.org> CommitDate: 2021-02-04 15:05:56 +0000      app-emulation/docker: 20.10.3 bump          Bug: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/768612>     Signed-off-by: William Hubbs <williamh@gentoo.org>   app-emulation/docker/Manifest              |   1 +  app-emulation/docker/docker-20.10.3.ebuild | 293 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  2 files changed, 294 insertions(+)  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=cdfb741d34233f5d2e57fe2f8cdd4946b0a3c8c5>  commit cdfb741d34233f5d2e57fe2f8cdd4946b0a3c8c5 Author:     William Hubbs <williamh@gentoo.org> AuthorDate: 2021-02-04 15:05:55 +0000 Commit:     William Hubbs <williamh@gentoo.org> CommitDate: 2021-02-04 15:05:55 +0000      app-emulation/docker: 19.03.15 bump          Bug: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/768612>     Signed-off-by: William Hubbs <williamh@gentoo.org>   app-emulation/docker/Manifest               |   1 +  app-emulation/docker/docker-19.03.15.ebuild | 333 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  2 files changed, 334 insertions(+) ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-02-04 15:13:02 UTC  ``` Thank you!

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.

CVE ID         : CVE-2020-15157 CVE-2020-15257 CVE-2021-21284 CVE-2021-21285

Multiple security issues were discovered in Docker, a Linux container
runtime, which could result in denial of service, an information leak
or privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 18.09.1+dfsg1-7.1+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your docker.io packages.

For a full list of pull requests and changes in this release, refer to the relevant GitHub milestones:

* [docker/cli, 27.4.1 milestone](https://github.com/docker/cli/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A27.4.1)
* [moby/moby, 27.4.1 milestone](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A27.4.1)

#### [Bug fixes and enhancements](#bug-fixes-and-enhancements)

* Fix excessive memory allocations when OTel is not configured.
  [moby/moby#49079](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/49079)
* The `docker info` command and the corresponding `GET /info` API endpoint no longer include warnings when `bridge-nf-call-iptables` or `bridge-nf-call-ip6tables` are disabled at the daemon is started. The `br_netfilter` kernel module is now attempted to be loaded when needed, which made those warnings inaccurate.
  [moby/moby#49090](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/49090)
* Attempt to load kernel modules, including `ip6_tables` and `br_netfilter` when required, using a method that is likely to succeed inside a Docker-in-Docker container.

* Update Buildx to
  [v0.19.3](https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.19.3).

  [moby/moby#49085](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/49085)

### [27.4.0](#2740)

*2024-12-09*

For a full list of pull requests and changes in this release, refer to the relevant GitHub milestones:

* [docker/cli, 27.4.0 milestone](https://github.com/docker/cli/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A27.4.0)
* [moby/moby, 27.4.0 milestone](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A27.4.0)

#### [API](#api)

* `GET /images/json` with the `manifests` option enabled now preserves the original order in which manifests appeared in the manifest-index.
  [moby/moby#48712](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48712)

#### [Bug fixes and enhancements](#bug-fixes-and-enhancements-1)

* When reading logs with the `jsonfile` or `local` log drivers, any errors while trying to read or parse underlying log files will cause the rest of the file to be skipped and move to the next log file (if one exists) rather than returning an error to the client and closing the stream. The errors are viewable in the Docker Daemon logs and exported to traces when tracing is configured.
  [moby/moby#48842](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48842)
* When reading log files, compressed log files are now only decompressed when needed rather than decompressing all files before starting the log stream.
  [moby/moby#48842](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48842)
* Fix an issue that meant published ports from one container on a bridge network were not accessible from another container on the same network with `userland-proxy` disabled, if the kernel's `br_netfilter` module was not loaded and enabled. The daemon will now attempt to load the module and enable `bridge-nf-call-iptables` or `bridge-nf-call-ip6tables` when creating a network with the userland proxy disabled.
  [moby/moby#48685](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48685)
* Fix loading of `bridge` and `br_netfilter` kernel modules.
  [moby/moby#48966](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48966)
* containerd image store: Fix Docker daemon failing to fully start with a "context deadline exceeded error" with containerd snapshotter and many builds/images.
  [moby/moby#48954](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48954)
* containerd image store: Fix partially pulled images not being garbage-collected.
  [moby#48910](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48910),
  [moby/moby#48957](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48957)
* containerd image store: Fix `docker image inspect` outputting duplicate references in `RepoDigests`.
  [moby/moby#48785](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48785)
* containerd image store: Fix not being able to connect to some insecure registries in cases where the HTTPS request failed due to a non-TLS related error.
  [moby/moby#48758](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48758)
* containerd image store: Remove a confusing warning log when tagging a non-dangling image.
  [moby/moby#49010](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/49010)
* containerd image store: Do not underline names in `docker image ls --tree`.
  [docker/cli#5519](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/5519)
* containerd image store: Change name of `USED` column in `docker image ls --tree` to `IN USE`.
  [docker/cli#5518](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/5518)
* `dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install --force` now ignores RootlessKit errors
  [moby/moby#48695](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48695)

* Remove BuildKit init timeout.
  [moby/moby#48963](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48963)
* Ignore "dataset does not exist" error when removing dataset on ZFS.
  [moby/moby#48968](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48968)
* Client: Prevent idle connections leaking FDs.
  [moby/moby#48764](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48764)
* Fix anonymous volumes being created through the `--mount` option not being marked as anonymous.
  [moby/moby#48755](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48755)
* After a daemon restart with live-restore, ensure an iptables jump to the `DOCKER-USER` chain is placed before other rules.
  [moby/moby#48714](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48714)
* Fix a possible memory leak caused by OTel meters.
  [moby/moby#48693](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48693)
* Create distinct build history db for each image store.
  [moby/moby#48688](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48688)

### [27.2.0](#2720)

*2024-08-27*

For a full list of pull requests and changes in this release, refer to the relevant GitHub milestones:

* [docker/cli, 27.2.0 milestone](https://github.com/docker/cli/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A27.2.0)
* [moby/moby, 27.2.0 milestone](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A27.2.0)
* Deprecated and removed features, see
  [Deprecated Features](https://github.com/docker/cli/blob/v27.2.0/docs/deprecated.md).
* Changes to the Engine API, see
  [API version history](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/v27.2.0/docs/api/version-history.md).

#### [New](#new)

The new features in this release are:

* [Device code login](#device-code-login)
* [Multi-platform support for `docker image ls`](#multi-platform-support-for-docker-image-ls)

##### [Device code login](#device-code-login)

This release adds support for using device code login when authenticating to
Docker Hub.

You can still use the old method of logging in with a username and password or
access token, but device code login is more secure and doesn't require you to
enter your password in the CLI.

![device-code-login](https://i.imgur.com/GRGjSjV.gif)

Device code login

![device-code-login](https://i.imgur.com/GRGjSjV.gif)

To use the old method, use `docker login -u <username>`.

##### [Multi-platform support for `docker image ls`](#multi-platform-support-for-docker-image-ls)

**Experimental**

This is experimental and may change at any time without any backward compatibility.

With the containerd image store enabled, the `docker image ls` command (or
`docker images` shorthand) now supports a `--tree` flag that now shows
if an image is a multi-platform image.

#### [API](#api-1)

* `GET /images/json` response now includes `Manifests` field, which contains information about the sub-manifests included in the image index. This includes things like platform-specific manifests and build attestations.

  The new field will only be populated if the request also sets the `manifests` query parameter to `true`.

  **Experimental**

  This is experimental and may change at any time without any backward compatibility.

#### [Bug fixes and enhancements](#bug-fixes-and-enhancements-5)

* CLI: Fix issue with remote contexts over SSH where the CLI would allocate a pseudo-TTY when connecting to the remote host, which causes issues in rare situations.
  [docker/cli#5351](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/5351)
* Fix an issue that prevented network creation with a `--ip-range` ending on a 64-bit boundary.
  [moby/moby#48326](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48326)
* CLI: IPv6 addresses shown by `docker ps` in port bindings are now bracketed.
  [docker/cli#5365](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/5365)
* containerd image store: Fix early error exit from `docker load` in cases where unpacking the image would fail.
  [moby/moby#48376](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48376)
* containerd image store: Fix the previous image not being persisted as dangling after `docker pull`.
  [moby/moby#48380](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48380)

#### [Packaging updates](#packaging-updates-6)

* Update BuildKit to
  [v0.15.2](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/releases/tag/v0.15.2).
  [moby/moby#48341](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48341)
* Update Compose to
  [v2.29.2](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/v2.29.2).
  [docker/docker-ce-packaging#1050](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce-packaging/pull/1050)
* Update containerd to
  [v1.7.21](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.7.21).
  [moby/moby#48383](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48383),
  [docker/containerd-packaging#389](https://github.com/docker/containerd-packaging/pull/389)

### [Known Issues](#known-issues)

* There is a known issue when authenticating against a registry in the Docker CLI (`docker login [registry address]`) where, if the provided registry address includes a repository/image name (such as `docker login index.docker.io/docker/welcome-to-docker`), the repository part (`docker/welcome-to-docker`) is not normalized and results in credentials being stored incorrectly, which causes subsequent pulls from the registry (`docker pull index.docker.io/docker/welcome-to-docker`) to not be authenticated. To prevent this, don't include any extraneous suffix in the registry address when running `docker login`.
  > **Note**
  >
  > Using `docker login` with an address that includes URL path segments is not a documented use case and is considered unsupported. The recommended usage is to specify only a registry hostname, and optionally a port, as the address for `docker login`.

### [27.0.1](#2701)

*2024-06-24*

For a full list of pull requests and changes in this release, refer to the relevant GitHub milestones:

#### [New](#new-1)

* containerd image store: Add `--platform` flag to `docker image push` and improve the default behavior when not all platforms of the multi-platform image are available locally.
  [docker/cli#4984](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/4984),
  [moby/moby#47679](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47679)

  [moby/moby#47804](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47804)

#### [Bug fixes and enhancements](#bug-fixes-and-enhancements-10)

* `*client.Client` instances are now always safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines. Previously, this could lead to data races when the `WithAPIVersionNegotiation()` option is used.
  [moby/moby#47961](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47961)
* Fix a bug causing the Docker CLI to leak Unix sockets in `$TMPDIR` in some cases.
  [docker/cli#5146](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/5146)
* Don't ignore a custom seccomp profile when used in conjunction with `--privileged`.
  [moby/moby#47500](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47500)
* rootless: overlay2: support native overlay diff when using rootless-mode with Linux kernel version 5.11 and later.
  [moby/moby#47605](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47605)
* Fix the `StartInterval` default value of healthcheck to reflect the documented value of 5s.
  [moby/moby#47799](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47799)
* Fix `docker save` and `docker load` not ending on the daemon side when the operation was cancelled by the user, for example with `Ctrl+C`.
  [moby/moby#47629](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47629)
* The `StartedAt` property of containers is now recorded before container startup, guaranteeing that the `StartedAt` is always before `FinishedAt`.
  [moby/moby#47003](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47003)
* The internal DNS resolver used by Windows containers on Windows now forwards requests to external DNS servers by default. This enables `nslookup` to resolve external hostnames. This behaviour can be disabled via `daemon.json`, using `"features": { "windows-dns-proxy": false }`. The configuration option will be removed in a future release.
  [moby/moby#47826](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47826)
* Print a warning when the CLI does not have permissions to read the configuration file.
  [docker/cli#5077](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/5077)
* Fix a goroutine and file-descriptor leak on container attach.
  [moby/moby#45052](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/45052)
* Clear the networking state of all stopped or dead containers during daemon start-up.
  [moby/moby#47984](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47984)
* Write volume options JSON atomically to avoid "invalid JSON" errors after system crash.
  [moby/moby#48034](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48034)
* Allow multiple macvlan networks with the same parent.
  [moby/moby#47318](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47318)
* Allow BuildKit to be used on Windows daemons that advertise it.
  [docker/cli#5178](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/5178)

#### [Networking](#networking)

* Allow sysctls to be set per-interface during container creation and network connection.
  [moby/moby#47686](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47686)
  + In a future release, this will be the only way to set per-interface sysctl options.
    For example, on the command line in a `docker run` command,`--network mynet --sysctl net.ipv4.conf.eth0.log_martians=1` will be rejected.
    Instead, you must use `--network name=mynet,driver-opt=com.docker.network.endpoint.sysctls=net.ipv4.conf.IFNAME.log_martians=1`.

##### [IPv6](#ipv6)

* `ip6tables` is no longer experimental. You may remove the `experimental` configuration option and continue to use IPv6, if it is not required by any other features.
* `ip6tables` is now enabled for Linux bridge networks by default.
  [moby/moby#47747](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47747)
  + This makes IPv4 and IPv6 behaviors consistent with each other, and reduces the risk that IPv6-enabled containers are inadvertently exposed to the network.
  + There is no impact if you are running Docker Engine with `ip6tables` enabled (new default).
  + If you are using an IPv6-enabled bridge network without `ip6tables`, this is likely a breaking change. Only published container ports (`-p` or `--publish`) are accessible from outside the Docker bridge network, and outgoing connections masquerade as the host.
  + To restore the behavior of earlier releases, no `ip6tables` at all, set `"ip6tables": false` in `daemon.json`, or use the CLI option `--ip6tables=false`. Alternatively, leave `ip6tables` enabled, publish ports, and enable direct routing.
  + With `ip6tables` enabled, if `ip6tables` is not functional on your host, Docker Engine will start but it will not be possible to create an IPv6-enabled network.

##### [IPv6 network configuration improvements](#ipv6-network-configuration-improvements)

* A Unique Local Address (ULA) base prefix is automatically added to `default-address-pools` if this parameter wasn't manually configured, or if it contains no IPv6 prefixes.
  [moby/moby#47853](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47853)
  + Prior to this release, to create an IPv6-enabled network it was necessary to use the `--subnet` option to specify an IPv6 subnet, or add IPv6 ranges to `default-address-pools` in `daemon.json`.
  + Starting in this release, when a bridge network is created with `--ipv6` and no IPv6 subnet is defined by those options, an IPv6 Unique Local Address (ULA) base prefix is used.
  + The ULA prefix is derived from the Engine host ID such that it's unique across hosts and over time.
* IPv6 address pools of any size can now be added to `default-address-pools`.
  [moby/moby#47768](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47768)
* IPv6 can now be enabled by default on all custom bridge networks using `"default-network-opts": { "bridge": {"com.docker.network.enable_ipv6": "true"}}` in `daemon.json`, or `dockerd --default-network-opt=bridge=com.docker.network.enable_ipv6=true`on the command line.
  [moby/moby#47867](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47867)
* Direct routing for IPv6 networks, with `ip6tables` enabled.
  [moby/moby#47871](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47871)
  + Added bridge driver option `com.docker.network.bridge.gateway_mode_ipv6=<nat|routed>`.
  + The default behavior, `nat`, is unchanged from previous releases running with `ip6tables` enabled. NAT and masquerading rules are set up for each published container port.
  + When set to `routed`, no NAT or masquerading rules are configured for published ports. This enables direct IPv6 access to the container, if the host's network can route packets for the container's address to the host. Published ports will be opened in the container's firewall.
  + When a port mapping only applies to `routed` mode, only addresses `0.0.0.0` or `::` are allowed and a host port must not be given.
  + Note that published container ports, in `nat` or `routed` mode, are accessible from any remote address if routing is set up in the network, unless the Docker host's firewall has additional restrictions. For example: `docker network create --ipv6 -o com.docker.network.bridge.gateway_mode_ipv6=routed mynet`.
  + The option `com.docker.network.bridge.gateway_mode_ipv4=<nat|routed>` is also available, with the same behavior but for IPv4.
* If firewalld is running on the host, Docker creates policy `docker-forwarding` to allow forwarding from any zone to the `docker` zone. This makes it possible to configure a bridge network with a routable IPv6 address, and no NAT or masquerading.
  [moby/moby#47745](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47745)
* When a port is published with no host port specified, or a host port range is given, the same port will be allocated for IPv4 and IPv6.
  [moby/moby#47871](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47871)
  + For example `-p 80` will result in the same ephemeral port being allocated for `0.0.0.0` and `::`, and `-p 8080-8083:80` will pick the same port from the range for both address families.
  + Similarly, ports published to specific addresses will be allocated the same port. For example, `-p 127.0.0.1::80 -p '[::1]::80'`.
  + If no port is available on all required addresses, container creation will fail.
* Environment variable `DOCKER_ALLOW_IPV6_ON_IPV4_INTERFACE`, introduced in release 26.1.1, no longer has any effect.
  [moby/moby#47963](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47963)
  + If IPv6 could not be disabled on an interface because of a read-only `/proc/sys/net`, the environment variable allowed the container to start anyway.
  + In this release, if IPv4 cannot be disabled for an interface, IPv6 can be explicitly enabled for the network simply by using `--ipv6` when creating it. Other workarounds are to configure the OS to disable IPv6 by default on new interfaces, mount `/proc/sys/net` read-write, or use a kernel with no IPv6 support.
* For IPv6-enabled bridge networks, do not attempt to replace the bridge's kernel-assigned link local address with `fe80::1`.
  [moby/moby#47787](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47787)

#### [Removed](#removed-2)

* Deprecate experimental GraphDriver plugins.
  [moby/moby#48050](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48050),
  [docker/cli#5172](https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/5172)
* pkg/archive: deprecate `NewTempArchive` and `TempArchive`. These types were only used in tests and will be removed in the next release.
  [moby/moby#48002](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48002)
* pkg/archive: deprecate `CanonicalTarNameForPath`
  [moby/moby#48001](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48001)
* Deprecate pkg/dmesg. This package was no longer used, and will be removed in the next release.
  [moby/moby#47999](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47999)
* Deprecate `pkg/stringid.ValidateID` and `pkg/stringid.IsShortID`
  [moby/moby#47995](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47995)
* runconfig: deprecate `SetDefaultNetModeIfBlank` and move `ContainerConfigWrapper` to `api/types/container`
  [moby/moby#48007](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48007)
* runconfig: deprecate `DefaultDaemonNetworkMode` and move to `daemon/network`
  [moby/moby#48008](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48008)
* runconfig: deprecate `opts.ConvertKVStringsToMap`. This utility is no longer used, and will be removed in the next release.
  [moby/moby#48016](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48016)
* runconfig: deprecate `IsPreDefinedNetwork`.
  [moby/moby#48011](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48011)

#### [API](#api-2)

* containerd image store: `POST /images/{name}/push` now supports a `platform` parameter (JSON encoded OCI Platform type) that allows selecting a specific platform-manifest from the multi-platform image. This is experimental and may change in future API versions.
  [moby/moby#47679](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47679)
* `POST /services/create` and `POST /services/{id}/update` now support `OomScoreAdj`.
  [moby/moby#47950](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47950)
* `ContainerList` api returns container annotations.
  [moby/moby#47866](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47866)
* `POST /containers/create` and `POST /services/create` now take `Options` as part of `HostConfig.Mounts.TmpfsOptions` allowing to set options for tmpfs mounts.
  [moby/moby#46809](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/46809)
* The `Healthcheck.StartInterval` property is now correctly ignored when updating a Swarm service using API versions less than v1.44.
  [moby/moby#47991](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47991)
* `GET /events` now supports image `create` event that is emitted when a new image is built regardless if it was tagged or not.
  [moby/moby#47929](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47929)
* `GET /info` now includes a `Containerd` field containing information about the location of the containerd API socket and containerd namespaces used by the daemon to run containers and plugins.
  [moby/moby#47239](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47239)
* Deprecate non-standard (config) fields in image inspect output. The `Config` field returned by this endpoint (used for `docker image inspect`) returned additional fields that are not part of the image's configuration and not part of the
  [Docker Image Spec](https://github.com/moby/docker-image-spec/blob/v1.3.1/specs-go/v1/image.go#L19-L32) and the
  [OCI Image Spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/v1.1.0/specs-go/v1/config.go#L24-L62). These fields are never set (and always return the default value for the type), but are not omitted in the response when left empty. As these fields were not intended to be part of the image configuration response, they are deprecated, and will be removed in the future API versions.
* Deprecate the daemon flag `--api-cors-header` and the corresponding `daemon.json` configuration option. These will be removed in the next major release.
  [moby/moby#45313](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/45313)

The following deprecated fields are currently included in the API response, but are not part of the underlying image's `Config`:
[moby/moby#47941](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47941)

* `Hostname`
* `Domainname`
* `AttachStdin`
* `AttachStdout`
* `AttachStderr`
* `Tty`
* `OpenStdin`
* `StdinOnce`
* `Image`
* `NetworkDisabled` (already omitted unless set)
* `MacAddress` (already omitted unless set)
* `StopTimeout` (already omitted unless set)

#### [Go SDK changes](#go-sdk-changes)

* Client API callback for the following functions now require a context parameter.
  [moby/moby#47536](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47536)
  + `client.RequestPrivilegeFunc`
  + `client.ImageSearchOptions.AcceptPermissionsFunc`
  + `image.ImportOptions.PrivilegeFunc`
* Remove deprecated aliases for Image types.
  [moby/moby#47900](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/47900)
  + `ImageImportOptions`
  + `ImageCreateOptions`
  + `ImagePullOptions`
  + `ImagePushOptions`
  + `ImageListOptions`
  + `ImageRemoveOptions`
* Introduce `Ulimit` type alias for `github.com/docker/go-units.Ulimit`.
  The `Ulimit` type as used in the API is defined in a Go module that will transition to a new location in future.
  A type alias is added to reduce the friction that comes with moving the type to a new location.
  The alias makes sure that existing code continues to work, but its definition may change in future.
  Users are recommended to use this alias instead of the `units.Ulimit` directly.
  [moby/moby#48023](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/48023)

Move and rename types, changing their import paths and exported names.

  + `NetworkCreateResponse`
  + `NetworkConnect`
  + `NetworkDisconnect`
  + `NetworkInspectOptions`
  + `EndpointResource`
  + `NetworkListOptions`
  + `NetworkCreateOptions`
  + `NetworkCreateRequest`
  + `NetworksPruneReport`
* Move `NetworkResource` to `api/types/network`.

  [moby/docker-ce-packaging#1032](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce-packaging/pull/1032)

### [27.0.0](#2700)

There's no 27.0.0 release due to a mistake during the pre-release of 27.0.0-rc.1 on GitHub which resulted in the v27.0.0 tag being created.
Unfortunately the tag was already picked up by the
[Go Module Mirror](https://sum.golang.org) so it's not possible to cleanly change the v27.0.0.
To workaround this, the 27.0.1 will be the first release of the 27.0.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

### [Network](#network)

Disable IPv6 Router Advertisements to prevent address spoofing.
[CVE-2020-13401](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-13401)

**Description**

In the Docker default configuration, the container network interface is a virtual ethernet link going to the host (veth interface).
In this configuration, an attacker able to run a process as root in a container can send and receive arbitrary packets to the host using the `CAP_NET_RAW` capability (present in the default configuration).

If IPv6 is not totally disabled on the host (via `ipv6.disable=1` on the kernel cmdline), it will be either unconfigured or configured on some interfaces, but itâs pretty likely that ipv6 forwarding is disabled, that is, `/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf//forwarding == 0`. Also by default, `/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf//accept_ra == 1`. The combination of these 2 sysctls means that the host accepts router advertisements and configures the IPv6 stack using them.

By sending ârogueâ router advertisements from a container, an attacker can reconfigure the host to redirect part or all of the IPv6 traffic of the host to the attacker-controlled container.

Even if there was no IPv6 traffic before, if the DNS returns A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records, many HTTP libraries will try to connect via IPv6 first then fallback to IPv4, giving an opportunity to the attacker to respond.
If by chance the host has a vulnerability like last yearâs RCE in apt (CVE-2019-3462), the attacker can now escalate to the host.

As `CAP_NET_ADMIN` is not present by default for Docker containers, the attacker canât configure the IPs they want to MitM, they canât use iptables to NAT or REDIRECT the traffic, and they canât use `IP_TRANSPARENT`.
The attacker can however still use `CAP_NET_RAW` and implement a tcp/ip stack in user space.

  [docker/engine#404](https://github.com/docker/engine/pull/404)

### [Known Issues](#known-issues)

#### [Existing](#existing)

* In some circumstances with large clusters, Docker information might, as part of the Swarm section,
  include the error `code = ResourceExhausted desc = grpc: received message larger than max (5351376 vs. 4194304)`. This does not indicate any failure or misconfiguration by the user,
  and requires no response.
* Orchestrator port conflict can occur when redeploying all services as new. Due to many Swarm manager
  requests in a short amount of time, some services are not able to receive traffic and are causing a `404`
  error after being deployed.
  + **Workaround:** restart all tasks via `docker service update --force`.
* [CVE-2018-15664](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15664) symlink-exchange attack with directory traversal. Workaround until proper fix is available in upcoming patch release: `docker pause` container before doing file operations.

### [Known Issues](#known-issues-1)

#### [New](#new)

* `DOCKER-USER` iptables chain is missing:
  [docker/for-linux#810](https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/810).
  Users cannot perform additional container network traffic filtering on top of
  this iptables chain. You are not affected by this issue if you are not
  customizing iptable chains on top of `DOCKER-USER`.
  + **Workaround:** Insert the iptables chain after the docker daemon starts.
    For example:

    ```
    iptables -N DOCKER-USER
    iptables -I FORWARD -j DOCKER-USER
    iptables -A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN
    ```

  + Workaround: restart all tasks via `docker service update --force`.
* Traffic cannot egress the HOST because of missing Iptables rules in the FORWARD chain
  The missing rules are :

  /sbin/iptables --wait -C FORWARD -o docker0 -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
  ```
  + Workaround: Add these rules back using a script and cron definitions. The script
    must contain '-C' commands to check for the presence of a rule and '-A' commands to add
    rules back. Run the script on a cron in regular intervals, for example, every minutes.

  [moby/moby#38335](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/38335)
* Added `IMAGE_NAME` attribute to `journald` log events.
  [moby/moby#38032](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/38032)

### [Deprecation](#deprecation)

* Deprecate image manifest v2 schema1 in favor of v2 schema2. Future version of Docker will remove
  support for v2 schema1 althogether.
  [moby/moby#39365](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/39365)
* Removed v1.10 migrator.
  [moby/moby#38265](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/38265)
* Now skipping deprecated storage-drivers in auto-selection.
  [moby/moby#38019](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/38019)
* Deprecated `aufs` storage driver and added warning.
  [moby/moby#38090](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/38090)
* Removed support for 17.09.

For more information on deprecated flags and APIs, refer to
[deprecation information](/engine/deprecated/) for target removal dates.

### [Known issues](#known-issues-4)

* In some circumstances with large clusters, docker information might, as part of the Swarm section,
  include the error `code = ResourceExhausted desc = grpc: received message larger than max (5351376 vs. 4194304)`. This does not indicate any failure or misconfiguration by the user,
  and requires no response.
* Orchestrator port conflict can occur when redeploying all services as new. Due to many swarm manager
  requests in a short amount of time, some services are not able to receive traffic and are causing a `404`
  error after being deployed.

  + Workaround: restart all tasks via `docker service update --force`.
* Traffic cannot egress the HOST because of missing Iptables rules in the FORWARD chain
  The missing rules are :

  ```
  /sbin/iptables --wait -C FORWARD -o docker_gwbridge -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
  /sbin/iptables --wait -C FORWARD -o docker0 -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
  ```
  + Workaround: Add these rules back using a script and cron definitions. The script
    must contain '-C' commands to check for the presence of a rule and '-A' commands to add
    rules back. Run the script on a cron in regular intervals, for example, every minutes.
  + Affected versions: 18.09.1, 19.03.0
* [CVE-2018-15664](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15664) symlink-exchange attack with directory traversal. Workaround until proper fix is available in upcoming patch release: `docker pause` container before doing file operations.
  [moby/moby#39252](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/39252)
* `docker cp` regression due to CVE mitigation. An error is produced when the source of `docker cp` is set to `/`.
