Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-21690:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that agent processes can bypass file path filtering by wrapping the file operation in an agent file path.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate path filtering for file operations initiated by agent processes.
- Ability for agent processes to manipulate file paths in a way that circumvents the intended security restrictions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file read and write access on the Jenkins controller file system.
- Potential to gain complete control of the Jenkins controller by manipulating files on the system.
- Possible disclosure of sensitive information from the controller.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to control an agent process connected to the Jenkins controller.
- They would then exploit the vulnerability by wrapping a file operation in an agent file path, which bypasses filtering.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Control of a Jenkins agent process.
- Ability to execute file operations from the compromised agent process.
