Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21430:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the usage of `File.createTempFile` method in the generated code of OpenAPI Generator. This method creates temporary files with insecure default permissions, potentially exposing sensitive data to other local users on Unix-like systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The `File.createTempFile` method creates temporary files with default permissions that are often too permissive (e.g., `-rw-r--r--` for files and `drwxr-xr-x` for directories). This allows other local users to read the content of these temporary files.
*   **Data Exposure:** When auto-generated clients download binary data (e.g., PDF files) through API endpoints, they initially store this data in insecure temporary files. This means sensitive information could be accessed by unauthorized local users before the application processes or removes the file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The primary impact is local information disclosure. An attacker with local access to the affected system could potentially read sensitive data stored in the temporary files generated by the vulnerable application.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable application is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be a local user on the same system where the vulnerable application is executing. The attacker doesn't need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Code Generators:** The vulnerability affects multiple code generators for Java (`okhttp-gson`, `jersey2`, `resteasy`, `retrofit2`) and Scala (`scala-finch`, `scala-akka`).
*   **Patch:** The fix involves changing the generated code to use `Files.createTempFile`, which provides better control over the permissions of the temporary file.
*   **Vulnerability Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.1.1 by using `Files.createTempFile` instead of `File.createTempFile`.
*   **Similar Vulnerability:** This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2021-21364 in the `swagger-codegen` project as both share the same original source tree.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.2 (Moderate), with a local attack vector, low complexity, no privileges required and high confidentiality impact.
*   **CWEs:** The related CWEs are CWE-377, CWE-378, and CWE-379.
*   The issue was reported by a user but they did not provide exact steps on how they found it, but identified the use of `File.createTempFile` as the root cause.

In summary, CVE-2021-21430 is a local information disclosure vulnerability due to the use of insecure temporary file creation in the auto-generated code, which was fixed by switching to `Files.createTempFile`.
