  "CVE-2021-21351": {
    "description": "XStream is vulnerable to an Arbitrary Code Execution attack.",
    "root_cause": "The processed stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects. XStream creates therefore new instances based on these type information. An attacker can manipulate the processed input stream and replace or inject objects, that result in execution of arbitrary code loaded from a remote server.",
     "vulnerabilities": [
      "Arbitrary code execution"
     ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by manipulating the processed input stream.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Manipulating the processed input stream."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to manipulate the processed input stream to inject malicious objects.",
