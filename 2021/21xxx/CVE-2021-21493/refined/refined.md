Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-21493:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the parsing of GIF files by SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer. Specifically, the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data in GIF files leads to several issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Out-of-bounds read:** Improper validation can lead to reading past the end of an allocated buffer.
*   **Memory corruption:** Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data in GIF files results in memory corruption.
*  **Out-of-bounds write:** Improper validation can lead to writing past the end of an allocated data structure.
*   **Uninitialized pointer:** A pointer is accessed before it is initialized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** In some cases, attackers can disclose sensitive information due to out-of-bounds read.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can leverage the memory corruption vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, which is the main threat.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious File:** An attacker can craft a malicious GIF file.
*   **Malicious Page:** An attacker can host a malicious page embedding a malicious GIF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, as the target user must open a malicious file or visit a malicious page.
*   **No Privilege Required:** The attacker does not need special privileges.

**Affected Product:** SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer.

**Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer 9.0 FP10 MP2.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by "xina1i" (or "xina1i at SecZone" in some reports)
* Multiple distinct vulnerabilities are associated with CVE-2021-21493, all related to GIF parsing within the SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer
