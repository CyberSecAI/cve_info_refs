## SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer GIF File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure Vulnerability

### ZDI-21-291ZDI-CAN-12098

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-21493](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-21493) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 3.3, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | SAP |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of GIF files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Fixed in SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer 9.0 FP10 MP2 |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2020-11-13 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2021-03-15 - Coordinated public release of advisory |
