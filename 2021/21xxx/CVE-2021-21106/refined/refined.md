Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21106:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free flaw within the autofill component of the Chromium browser. This means that memory is being accessed after it has been freed, potentially leading to crashes or other undefined behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core weakness is that the code attempts to access memory that has already been deallocated. This can occur when an object or resource is released, but a pointer to that memory is still held and subsequently used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The most severe impact of this vulnerability could be the execution of arbitrary code on the user's system. This could allow an attacker to take control of the browser or even the entire operating system.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A use-after-free can also lead to crashes or unstable behavior of the browser, resulting in denial of service.
- **Information Disclosure:** In some scenarios, the use of freed memory might reveal sensitive information to an attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is within the browser's autofill component, implying that user interaction related to autofill (e.g., submitting forms with stored information) could trigger the flaw.
- The issue can be triggered remotely via a malicious website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would likely need to lure a victim to a malicious website or find a way to inject malicious content into a website that the victim visits.
- The attacker needs a good understanding of the autofill mechanism in chromium to craft a targeted exploit.
- The attacker would also need to bypass any mitigation techniques implemented by the browser.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Weipeng Jiang (@Krace) from Codesafe Team of Legendsec at Qi'anxin Group.
- Google assigned a reward of $20,000 for the discovery.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Chromium version 87.0.4280.141 and later.
- The vulnerability was discovered on November 13th, 2020.
