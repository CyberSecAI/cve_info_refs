{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The hyper HTTP server incorrectly interprets requests with multiple `Transfer-Encoding` headers. It checks each header for `chunked` instead of only the last one, which should have been done according to RFC 7230.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of multiple `Transfer-Encoding` headers.",
        "Logic error in checking for chunked transfer encoding."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can perform request smuggling or desync attacks by sending requests with multiple `Transfer-Encoding` headers that are interpreted differently by the hyper server and an upstream HTTP proxy, leading to the injection of malicious content into subsequent requests.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending HTTP/1.1 requests with multiple `Transfer-Encoding` headers to a vulnerable hyper server behind an upstream HTTP proxy."
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to a vulnerable hyper server that is behind an upstream proxy. The upstream proxy must also misinterpret the multiple Transfer-Encoding headers in order for the attack to succeed."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "description": "Hyper's HTTP server code had a flaw that incorrectly understands some requests with multiple transfer-encoding headers to have a chunked payload, when it should have been rejected as illegal. This combined with an upstream HTTP proxy that understands the request payload boundary differently can result in 'request smuggling' or 'desync attacks'.",

    "workarounds": [
      "Reject requests that contain a `transfer-encoding` header.",
      "Ensure any upstream proxy handles `transfer-encoding` correctly."
