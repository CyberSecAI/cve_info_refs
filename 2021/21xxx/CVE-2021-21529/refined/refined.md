- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Dell System Update (DSU) versions 1.9 and earlier have a denial-of-service vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application does not properly handle multiple instances being run simultaneously, leading to memory exhaustion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit can cause the system to run out of memory, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors**: A local authenticated malicious user with low privileges can exploit this vulnerability by running multiple instances of the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system and be authenticated with low privileges.
