Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21365:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the improper encoding of user input within HTML context in the "Bootstrap Package" TYPO3 extension. Specifically, the extension uses `<f:format.htmlentitiesDecode>` which decodes HTML entities, instead of encoding HTML special characters. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code in several templates.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts into web pages. This could lead to:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by rendering content in the website frontend.
- The attacker needs to inject malicious code into specific input fields of content elements.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs a valid backend user account.
- The attacker must be able to create or edit content elements that use the vulnerable templates (e.g., carousel items, subheaders) and inject malicious code into fields like header, subheader, or text bodies.
- The attacker needs to be able to insert the malicious code in the TYPO3 backend, as the malicious script is not sanitized when rendered in the frontend.

**Affected templates:**
- `Resources/Private/Partials/ContentElements/Carousel/Item/CallToAction.html`
- `Resources/Private/Partials/ContentElements/Carousel/Item/Header.html`
- `Resources/Private/Partials/ContentElements/Carousel/Item/Text.html`
- `Resources/Private/Partials/ContentElements/Carousel/Item/TextAndImage.html`
- `Resources/Private/Partials/ContentElements/Header/SubHeader.html`

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability is fixed by replacing the usage of `<f:format.htmlentitiesDecode>` with `<f:format.htmlspecialchars doubleEncode="false">` within the templates. Patched versions are: 7.1.2, 8.0.8, 9.0.4, 9.1.3, 10.0.10, and 11.0.3. Users are advised to update the extension as soon as possible.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided GitHub commit shows the exact changes made to fix this vulnerability in the specified templates.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 5.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C), which indicates a moderate severity.
- The exploitability is considered high, given that the attacker needs a valid backend user account and needs to be able to edit/create content with the vulnerable fields.
- The Github content includes a link to the commit that fixes the vulnerability, allowing a developer to see the fix.
