  "response": {
    "match": true,
    "data": {
      "root_cause": "The less-openui5 library used a vulnerable version of Less.js (v1.6.3) which allowed the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code embedded within .less files.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "The `javascriptEnabled` option in the Less.js parser was enabled by default, allowing for the execution of JavaScript code within `.less` files.",
        "The library used a forked version of Less.js v1.6.3 which is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution through inline JavaScript."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a `.less` file that would be executed during the build process, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution (ACE) on the build server or developer's machine.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker could create a malicious library or theme containing a custom control with JavaScript code hidden in one of the `.less` files.",
        "An attacker could provide a crafted .less file through an untrusted source, which when processed, will execute the malicious JavaScript code."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide or modify `.less` files that will be processed by the less-openui5 library. This could be achieved by creating a malicious library or theme, or by gaining access to the build system.",
       "additional_details": "The vulnerability was present due to the usage of an old forked version of the Less.js library. The maintainers removed the inline JavaScript execution feature from their Less.js fork completely. The vulnerability was fixed in less-openui5 version v0.10.0 by disabling the JavaScript execution feature, and removing the `javascriptEnabled` parser option. Note that disabling the Inline JavaScript feature in Less.js versions 1.x, still evaluates code has additional double codes around it."
