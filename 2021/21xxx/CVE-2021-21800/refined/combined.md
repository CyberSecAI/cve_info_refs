# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2021-1271

## Advantech R-SeeNet ssh\_form.php Reflected XSS vulnerability

##### July 15, 2021

##### CVE Number

CVE-2021-21800

### Summary

Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities exist in the ssh\_form.php script functionality of Advantech R-SeeNet v 2.4.12 (20.10.2020). If a user visits a specially crafted URL, it can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the context of the targeted user’s browser. An attacker can provide a crafted URL to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Advantech R-SeeNet 2.4.12 (20.10.2020)

### Product URLs

<https://ep.advantech-bb.cz/products/software/r-seenet>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.6 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-79 - Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (‘Cross-site Scripting’)

### Details

R-SeeNet is the software system used for monitoring Advantech routers.
It continuously collects information from individual routers in the network and records the data into a SQL database.

This vulnerability is present in ssh\_form.php script, which is a part of the Advantech R-SeeNet web applications.
A specially crafted URL by an attacker and visited by a victim can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution.

The ssh\_form.php script accepts `hostname` parameter coming from the user via a HTTP request:

```
php/ssh_form.php
Line 9 	  if(isset($_GET['hostname']) && ($_GET['hostname'] != ''))
Line 10	  {  // hostname zadano
Line 11		 $hostname = $_GET['hostname'];
Line 12	  }

```

The parameter is not sanitized in a context of XSS payload and further is embedded into a HTML code :

```
Line 42     <title>SSH Session <?php echo($hostname)?></title>
(...)
Line 63 	<param name="jcterm.destinations"  value="root@<?php echo $hostname?>">

```

Request example

```
GET /php/ssh_form.php?hostname=%3C/title%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E%3Ctitle%3E HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:86.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/86.0
