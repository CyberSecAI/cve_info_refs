- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `ssh_form.php` script in Advantech R-SeeNet does not sanitize the `hostname` parameter received via HTTP GET request before embedding it into the HTML code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The lack of input sanitization on the `hostname` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the context of the victim's browser. This could potentially lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the website, or other malicious actions within the user's browser session.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code within the `hostname` parameter. The victim needs to visit this malicious URL for the XSS to trigger.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious payload. They do not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability. They need to get the victim to click on the malicious link or redirect to it to trigger the exploit.
