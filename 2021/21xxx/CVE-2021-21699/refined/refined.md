Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-21699:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Active Choices Plugin versions 2.5.6 and earlier does not properly escape the parameter name of reactive and dynamic reference parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The lack of escaping allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the parameter name.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view the vulnerable parameters. This can potentially lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user views a job configuration that contains a reactive or dynamic reference parameter with a malicious name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have `Job/Configure` permission to create or modify a job with the specially crafted parameter name.
