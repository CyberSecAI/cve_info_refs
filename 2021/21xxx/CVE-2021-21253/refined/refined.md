Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-21253

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The application was using a one-way hash (SHA-256) without a salt to store user passwords.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use of One-Way Hash without Salt (CWE-759):** The primary weakness was the absence of a salt when hashing passwords. This made the system vulnerable to dictionary attacks, rainbow tables, and other pre-computed hash techniques, increasing the likelihood of password compromise.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Security Breach:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to crack user passwords, leading to unauthorized access to accounts.
- **Compromise of the Voting System:**  With compromised accounts, an attacker could manipulate votes, alter system configurations or cause data loss within the online voting system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Dictionary Attacks:** Attackers could use pre-computed hash tables (rainbow tables) or dictionary attacks to match hashed passwords with potential plain-text passwords.
- **Pre-computed Hashes:** Due to the lack of a salt, the same password would always produce the same hash, making it easier to crack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to password hashes:** The attacker would need access to the database containing the stored password hashes of users.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was present in OnlineVotingSystem versions prior to 1.1.2.
- The fix (in version 1.1.2) includes adding a long, randomly generated salt to the password hashing function.
- The commit `0181cb0272857696c8eb3e44fcf6cb014ff90f09` demonstrates a change that appears to add a salt to the SHA-256 hashing, though not yet correctly implemented (see the switch between `String password = sha.getSHA(request.getParameter("pass"));` and  `String password = request.getParameter("pass");` in `AdminLoginController.java` and `VoterLoginController.java`).
- The commit `bd4e6bc` mentioned in the references is the actual fix of this issue.
