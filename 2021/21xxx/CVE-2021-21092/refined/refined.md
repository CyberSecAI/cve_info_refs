Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when processing DCM files within Adobe Bridge. This lack of validation leads to a memory corruption issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Memory Corruption:** Specifically, the vulnerability is categorized as a memory corruption issue, which is a type of software bug where data is written to an area of memory that is not intended to receive it.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the inadequate validation of user-supplied data, which in turn permits the memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. This means the attacker can potentially gain control of the system, install malware, steal data, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious DCM File:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a specially crafted malicious DCM file in Adobe Bridge.
- **Malicious Webpage:** A user visiting a malicious webpage could be another attack vector, likely by automatically triggering a download/open of a malicious DCM file. The ZDI advisory does not provide a specific attack scenario for web based attacks however that could be a possible attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker does not need physical access to the victim's machine.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to either open a malicious DCM file or visit a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability. This makes it a "user-assisted" attack. The user needs to be using a vulnerable version of Adobe Bridge.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "critical" by Adobe.
- The vulnerability is present in Adobe Bridge versions 10.1.1 and earlier, and 11.0.1 and earlier, on Windows.
- Adobe has released updates (10.1.2 and 11.0.2) to address this issue on both Windows and macOS.
- The vulnerability was reported to Adobe by Francis Provencher of Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).

This information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, as it includes specifics about the affected file type (DCM), the vulnerable component (data validation in DCM processing), and specific exploitation method (malicious file/webpage and user interaction).
