Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-21282

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper validation of the `segments_left` field in the Source Routing Header (SRH) against the calculated `path_len` value within the RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) implementations of Contiki-NG.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The `segments_left` field from the SRH is not checked against the calculated `path_len`.
- **Buffer Overflow:** Due to the missing validation, the index used to access addresses in the packet buffer can be calculated to point outside the bounds of the buffer. This leads to a buffer overflow when a `memcpy` operation is performed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A buffer overflow can occur, potentially leading to denial of service (DoS), code execution, or other undefined behavior by overflowing the allocated memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted IPv6 packet with a malicious Source Routing Header.
- The `cmpre` field within the SRH is manipulated to create a small `path_len` value.
- The `segments_left` field is set to a larger value than `path_len`, causing an out-of-bounds read when the next address is calculated.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject IPv6 packets into the network.
- The attacker needs to know the network topology to craft the malicious packet correctly.

**More detail than the official CVE description:**
- The provided content details how the path_len is calculated using `cmpre`, and how manipulating `cmpre` leads to a smaller path_len value which can then be exploited using the `segments_left` field
- The content also specifies the code line numbers where the vulnerability exists and is triggered in `os/net/routing/rpl-lite/rpl-ext-header.c` and `os/net/routing/rpl-classic/rpl-ext-header.c`.
- The content also identifies the fix, which is to validate the `segments_left` field with the `path_len` and references the specific pull request #1183.
