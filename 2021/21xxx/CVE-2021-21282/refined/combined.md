### @nvt **[nvt](/nvt)** commented [Jan 28, 2020](#issue-556250335)

As recommended on page 9 in RFC 6554, the `segments_left` field should be checked before continuing the packet processing. Otherwise, the index of the next address to be visited, which is calculated on line 242, can be used to make `addr_ptr` point outside the packet data.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Buffer overflow in RPL source routing header processing

Moderate

[joakimeriksson](/joakimeriksson)
published
GHSA-6xf2-77gf-fgjx
Jun 18, 2021

## Package

Contiki-NG

## Affected versions

< 4.5

## Patched versions

4.5

## Description

### Impact

A buffer overflow can be triggered by an input packet when using either of Contiki-NG's two RPL implementations in source-routing mode. In particular, the `segments_left value` taken from the source routing header is not validated against the `path_len` value, which is calculated in the os/net/routing/rpl-lite/rpl-ext-header.c module on line 117 as follows:

```
path_len = ((ext_len - padding - RPL_RH_LEN - RPL_SRH_LEN - (16 - cmpre)) / (16 - cmpri)) + 1;

```

Since the `cmpre` value used in this calculation can be controlled by an attacker, it is possible to generate a `path_len` value that is smaller than the `segments_left` value. When calculating the index of the next address to process, as shown below from line 132, it is possible for the value to overflow and result in an index that points outside the packet buffer. A memcpy call on line 143 will then cause the a buffer overflow.

Note that the problem exists in the os/net/routing/rpl-classic/rpl-ext-header.c module as well, but with different line numbers.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG 4.5.

### Workarounds

Users can apply the patch in [Contiki-NG PR #1183](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1183).

### References

The recommended procedure for processing source routing headers is documented in [RFC 6554](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6554).
