Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-21644:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Config File Provider Plugin did not require POST requests for a specific HTTP endpoint, which enabled a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. This vulnerability is due to an incomplete fix of a previous security issue (SECURITY-938).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CSRF vulnerability due to missing POST request requirement on an HTTP endpoint.
- Incomplete fix for a previous security issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can delete configuration files by sending a crafted request with a specified ID.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is conducted through an HTTP endpoint that does not validate the request method (missing check for POST request), making it susceptible to CSRF.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to trick a user with an active session in Jenkins to trigger a malicious request. The user does not need any specific permissions besides being authenticated to the Jenkins instance.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in Config File Provider Plugin versions 3.7.0 and earlier.
- The fix is implemented in version 3.7.1 by requiring POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoint.
