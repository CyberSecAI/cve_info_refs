Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21745:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The ZTE MF971R product has a Referer authentication bypass vulnerability. The vulnerability exists due to the lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) verification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Referer Authentication Bypass:** The device relies on the Referer header for authentication, which can be easily manipulated by an attacker.
- **Missing CSRF Protection:**  The application lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection, making it vulnerable to attacks where malicious actions are performed on behalf of a logged-in user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can perform "illegal authorization operations". This likely means the attacker can trigger actions on the device that they are not authorized to perform. This could involve changing device settings or causing other unauthorized actions.
- This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized configuration changes or other actions within the device's management interface.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- The attacker needs to induce a user to click a specially crafted link or visit a malicious webpage.
- The vulnerability requires user interaction (UI:R), as the user has to click the attacker-controlled link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker does not need to be authenticated (PR:N).
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs or HTML pages that trick the user into clicking.
- The attacker does not need to be on the local network, so the attack can be done remotely.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSS v3.1 base score of 4.7 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N)
- The scope is changed (S:C), which indicates that the vulnerability in one area of the product (potentially the management interface) can affect other areas of the device.
- The vulnerability does not directly allow for confidentiality or availability impact, but does allow for integrity impact.
- The affected product is the ZTE MF971R with various firmware versions prior to the specified resolved versions.
