Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21626:

**CVE-2021-21626**

*   **Root Cause:** The Warnings Plugin did not perform adequate permission checks in methods used for form validation. Specifically, it failed to check if the user had `Item/Workspace` or `Item/Configure` permission before allowing them to validate file patterns against workspace contents.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Authorization Check:** The plugin lacked proper permission checks in its form validation methods.
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  The vulnerability allowed unauthorized users to probe the contents of a workspace using file pattern validation.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with `Item/Read` permission could effectively list the contents of a Jenkins workspace by sending a series of requests to validate file patterns. This unauthorized access to workspace information could reveal sensitive data and/or configuration details that could be leveraged for further attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessed via HTTP requests to the Jenkins server.
    *   **Exploitation Method:**  An attacker sends a sequence of requests to the plugin's form validation methods, manipulating file patterns to reveal workspace content.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs a valid account with `Item/Read` permissions, but without `Item/Workspace` or `Item/Configure` permissions within the Jenkins environment.
    *   Network access to the Jenkins server is also required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Warnings Plugin versions 8.4.4 and earlier.
*   The fix is implemented in version 8.5.0, which requires `Item/Configure` permission to perform pattern validation with workspace contents.
