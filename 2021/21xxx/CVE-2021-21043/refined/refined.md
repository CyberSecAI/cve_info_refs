Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of invalid JCR (Java Content Repository) characters within the `version-compare` and `page-compare` tools of ACS AEM Commons.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present due to improper sanitization of user input that contains invalid JCR characters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable form fields.
- Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute the malicious JavaScript within the victim's browser session.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `version-compare` and `page-compare` tools.
- Attackers must provide malicious input containing invalid JCR characters into vulnerable form fields.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide crafted input to the affected tools, which suggests user interaction is required.
- The attacker must know how to craft input with invalid JCR characters.
- The attacker would rely on a victim visiting the vulnerable component with the malicious crafted input.
