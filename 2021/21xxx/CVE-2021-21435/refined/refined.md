Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of data during PDF export within the OTRS (Open Ticket Request System) software. Specifically, article Bcc fields and agent personal information are inadvertently included when a customer prints a ticket as a PDF through the external interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive information (Bcc fields and agent personal data) to unauthorized users (customers) via the generated PDF.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privacy Violation:**  The most significant impact is the violation of privacy by exposing information intended for internal use only (Bcc recipients, agent data).
- **Potential Security Risks:** Depending on the information revealed, this could lead to further security risks, such as:
    - Social engineering attacks if agent personal information is used.
    - Unauthorized access to internal communications if Bcc'd email addresses are exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **External Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered when a customer uses the external interface of the OTRS system to print a ticket as a PDF.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user (customer) to initiate the PDF generation process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User (Customer):**  An attacker needs to be a customer with access to the OTRS system's external interface.
- **Basic Interaction:** The attacker simply needs to utilize the print-to-PDF function to trigger the vulnerability.

**Affected Versions:**
- ((OTRS)) Community Edition 6.0.x versions up to 6.0.30
- OTRS 7.0.x versions up to 7.0.23
- OTRS 8.0.x versions up to 8.0.10

**Fix:**
The vulnerability is fixed in the following versions:
- OTRS 8.0.11
- OTRS 7.0.24

**CVSS Score:** 5.7 MEDIUM (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
-   AV:N (Network): The attack can be launched remotely.
-   AC:L (Low): The attack is easily performed.
-   PR:L (Low):  A low-privileged user can perform the attack.
-   UI:R (Required): User interaction is required.
-   S:U (Unchanged): The attack impacts only the vulnerable component.
-   C:H (High):  There is a high impact on confidentiality.
-   I:N (None): No impact on integrity.
-   A:N (None): No impact on availability.
