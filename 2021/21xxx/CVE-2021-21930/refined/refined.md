The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21930.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the misuse of prepared statements in combination with stored procedures and SQL concatenation within the Advantech R-SeeNet application. Specifically, variables used to build SQL queries, despite being initially sanitized with `mysqli_real_escape_string`, lose their protection when incorporated into a final prepared statement due to direct string concatenation. The final SQL query is built by concatenating user-controlled input with other SQL code and is then executed, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the presence of SQL injection vulnerabilities in the 'device_list' page of the Advantech R-SeeNet application due to improper handling of user-supplied input in SQL queries. The application uses a stored procedure (`sp_GetDevicesUser`) that constructs a SQL query by concatenating a string containing user-provided input (`params`) and then executes it without proper parameter binding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration
    - Data modification
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive information
    - Denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET requests to the `/r-seenet/index.php?page=device_list` page. The vulnerable parameters include:
    - `desc_filter` (CVE-2021-21924)
    - `firm_filter` (CVE-2021-21925)
    - `health_filter` (CVE-2021-21926)
    - `loc_filter` (CVE-2021-21927)
    - `mac_filter` (CVE-2021-21928)
    - `prod_filter` (CVE-2021-21929)
    - `sn_filter` (CVE-2021-21930)
    - `stat_filter` (CVE-2021-21931)
    - `name_filter` (CVE-2021-21932)
    - `esn_filter` (CVE-2021-21933)
    - `imei_filter` (CVE-2021-21934)
    - `host_alt_filter2` (CVE-2021-21935)
    - `health_alt_filter` (CVE-2021-21936)
    - `host_alt_filter` (CVE-2021-21937)
    
By manipulating these parameters, attackers can insert malicious SQL code into the query executed by the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Advantech R-SeeNet application to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker can also leverage Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) to trigger these vulnerabilities if they are able to trick a user into making the malicious request.
