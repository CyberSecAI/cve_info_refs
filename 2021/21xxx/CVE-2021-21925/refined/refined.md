Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-21925:

**CVE-2021-21925:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of user-supplied input within SQL queries. Specifically, the `firm_filter` parameter is used to build an SQL query, and although the input is sanitized using `mysqli_real_escape_string`, it is later concatenated into a query string that is executed via a stored procedure, losing the protection afforded by `mysqli_real_escape_string`.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** SQL Injection. The application does not properly neutralize special elements used in an SQL command, leading to SQL injection.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, or even complete database takeover. In the example provided, the injection is used to cause a time-based blind SQL injection, by using a `SLEEP()` function to induce a delay.

*   **Attack Vectors:** By crafting malicious HTTP GET requests to the `/r-seenet/index.php?page=device_list` endpoint with a manipulated `firm_filter` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user or have the ability to perform Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks to make requests to the server.
    *   The attacker must be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability lies in the `device_list.php` file, where the `firm_filter` GET parameter is captured, URL decoded, and stored in a session variable. This session variable is later used to construct a SQL query. Although `mysqli_real_escape_string` is used to sanitize the input, the constructed query is passed to a stored procedure via string concatenation, which reintroduces the SQL injection risk. The stored procedure constructs a query string from the parameters passed to it, before executing it as a prepared statement.

The vulnerable code snippet within `device_list.php` is as follows:

```php
262   if(isset($_GET['firm_filter']))
263   {	// je nastaven filtr firmware
264     $_SESSION['firm_filter'] = urldecode($_GET['firm_filter']);
265   }
...
607   if((isset($_SESSION['firm_filter'])) && ($_SESSION['firm_filter'] != ''))
608   {
609     $sql = $sql.'AND firmware="'.mysqli_real_escape_string($link,$_SESSION['firm_filter']).'" ';
610  }
...
866     $sql = 'call sp_GetDevicesUser(\''.$sql.'\',\''.get_user_id().'\')';
...
869 	$result = db_multi_query($link, $sql);

```

And the vulnerable stored procedure part (companies.sql)

```sql
870             SET @sql = CONCAT('SELECT
...
925             FROM device_list WHERE ""="" ',params) ;
926
927 						PREPARE stmt FROM @sql;
928
929 						EXECUTE stmt;
```

The example exploit provided in the report uses `SLEEP(5)` to perform a time-based blind SQL injection.

```
GET /r-seenet/index.php?page=device_list&host_filter=a&health_filter=a&desc_filter=a&loc_filter=a&prod_filter=a&stat_filter=a&firm_filter=a1%22%20AND%20(SELECT%201%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))a)--%20&sn_filter=a&mac_filter=a HTTP/1.1
