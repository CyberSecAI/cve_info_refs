## Upgrade Information

You can upgrade to VMware Cloud Foundation 3.11 either from VMware Cloud Foundation 3.10.2.2 (sequential upgrade) or from VMware Cloud Foundation 3.7.1 or later (skip-level upgrade). VMware Cloud Foundation 3.11 cannot be deployed as a new release. For upgrade information, refer to the [*VMware Cloud Foundation Upgrade Guide*](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/3.11/vcf-lifecycle/GUID-B384B08D-3652-45E2-8AA9-AF53066F5F70.html).

VMware Cloud Foundation 3.11 is supported as a source version for migration to VMware Cloud Foundation 4.x.

**vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager Version 2.1.0 Patch 3**

There is no upgrade bundle for vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager Version 2.1.0 Patch 3. To upgrade, follow the process described in the [VMware vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager 2.1 Patch 3 Release Notes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vRealize-Suite-Lifecycle-Manager/2.1/rn/VMware-vRealize-Suite-Lifecycle-Manager-21-Patch-3-Release-Notes.html).

**Design Considerations for Multiple Availability Zones**

NSX-T Data Center 3.x changes how the northbound traffic flow can be influenced. If you have the following architecture, you must change the Tier-0 gateway architecture **before** you upgrade to NSX-T Data Center 3.x:

* An NSX Edge cluster with edge nodes placed in both availability zones (typically two edge nodes pinned to Availability Zone 1 and two edge nodes pinned to Availability Zone 2)
* An Active/Active Tier-0 gateway architecture where the Tier-0 gateway spans edge nodes in both availability zones.
* Deployed in a data center infrastructure that cannot tolerate asymmetrical routing to or from each availability zone, for example, for physical data center firewalls, and other.

Change to a Tier-0 gateway architecture where the Tier-0 gateway is active only in a single availability zone at a time in one of the following ways:

* **Recommended**: Place an NSX Edge cluster with edge nodes in a single availability zone only (typically Availability Zone 1), that fail over using vSphere HA to Availability Zone 2 on failure. This change requires changes in the data center fabric including stretching of the Uplink and Edge TEP VLANs between the availability zones. See [KB 87426](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/87426) for more information.
* Migrate to an Active/Standby Tier-0 gateway. Follow the [NSX-T Data Center 3.x product documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/index.html) for changing from an Active/Active to an Active/Standby architecture of the Tier-0 gateway.

**Changing from a Three N-VDS to Single N-VDS Edge Node Design**

Starting with NSX-T Data Center 2.5, a single N-VDS switch design is available in the NSX Edge node. Changing from three N-VDS instances to a single N-VDS provides network throughput and scalability improvements in NSX-T Data Center. It is recommended for all environments but highly recommended for environments deployed at scale.

The procedure involves the following high-level steps:

* Deploy a new NSX Edge cluster with new edge nodes based on the single N-VDS design.
* Deploy a new Tier-0 gateway and verify connectivity.
* Once tested, you can reconfigure your Tier-1 gateways to utilize the new Tier-0 gateway on the single N-VDS edge cluster.

See [KB 87426](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/87426) for more information.

## VMware Cloud Foundation 3.11.0.1 Release Information

You can upgrade to VMware Cloud Foundation 3.11.0.1 either from VMware Cloud Foundation 3.11 (sequential upgrade) or from VMware Cloud Foundation 3.7.1 or later (skip-level upgrade). VMware Cloud Foundation 3.11.0.1 cannot be deployed as a new release. For upgrade information, refer to the VMware Cloud Foundation Upgrade Guide. It is strongly recommended that all customers on VCF 3.x upgrade to VCF 3.11.0.1.

VMware Cloud Foundation 3.11.0.1 contains the following BOM updates:

| Software Component | Version | Date | Build Number |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SDDC Manager | 3.11.0.1 | 07 APR 2022 | 19571759 |
| VMware NSX Data Center for vSphere | 6.4.13 | 08 FEB 2022 | 19307994 |

SDDC Manager 3.11.0.1 fixes the issue:

* Deleting an NSX for vSphere (NSX-V) VI workload domain incorrectly deletes the NSX controllers for the management domain

VMware NSX Data Center for vSphere 6.4.13 addresses the security vulnerability described in [VMSA-2022-0005](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2022-0005.html)

### Upgrade Known Issues

* **File permissions precheck gets stuck or captures permission issues in wrong directories**

  There are two potential issues:

  + The LCM directories permission precheck does not finish for more than an hour.
  + The LCM directories permission precheck reports permission/ownership issues in `/var/log` directories.

  Workaround: See [KB 90205](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/90205).
* **Upgrade precheck fails for PSC SSO**

  If the maximum lifetime password policy for vCenter Single Sign-On local accounts is set to a number greater than 9999, then the upgrade precheck fails.

  Workaround: Set the maximum lifetime password policy to any number less than or equal to 9999. See [KB 88163](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/88163) for more information.
* **There is a cosmetic mismatch between the posted manifest date (02/11/2022) and the release notes software date (02/14/2022).**

  There are no technical side effects.
* **The vRealize Automation upgrade reports the "Precheck Execution Failure : Make sure the latest version of VMware Tools is installed" message**

  The vRealize Automation IaaS VMs must have the same version of VMware Tools as the ESXi hosts on which the VMs reside.

  Workaround: Upgrade VMware Tools on the vRealize Automation IaaS VMs.
* **Error upgrading vRealize Automation**

  Under certain circumstances, upgrading vRealize Automation may fail with a message similar to:

  ```
  An automated upgrade has failed. Manual intervention is required.
  vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager Pre-upgrade checks for vRealize Automation have failed:
  vRealize Automation Validations : iaasms1.rainpole.local : RebootPending : Check if reboot is pending : Reboot the machine.
  vRealize Automation Validations : iaasms2.rainpole.local : RebootPending : Check if reboot is pending : Reboot the machine.
  Please retry the upgrade once the upgrade is available again.
  ```

  1. Log-in into the first VM listed in the error message using RDP or the VMware Remote Console.
  2. Reboot the VM.
  3. Wait 5 minutes after the login screen of the VM appears.
  4. Repeat steps 1-3 for the next VM listed in the error message.
  5. Once you have restarted all the VMs listed in the error message, retry the vRealize Automation upgrade.
* **When there is no associated workload domain to vRealize Automation, the VRA VM NODES CONSISTENCY CHECK upgrade precheck fails**

  This upgrade precheck compares the content in the logical inventory on the SDDC Manager and the content in the vRealize Lifecycle Manager environment. When there is no associated workload domain, the vRealize Lifecycle Manager environment does not contain information about the `iaasagent1.rainpole.local` and `iaasagent2.rainpole.local` nodes. Therefore the check fails.

  Workaround: None. You can safely ignore a failed `VRA VM NODES CONSISTENCY CHECK` during the upgrade precheck. The upgrade will succeed even with this error.
* **NSX Data Center for vSphere upgrade fails with the message "Host Prep remediation failed"**

  After addressing the issue, the NSX Data Center for vSphere bundle no longer appears as an available update.

  Workaround: To complete the upgrade, manually enable the anti-affinity rules.

  1. Log in to the management vCenter Server using the vSphere Client.
  2. Click **Menu > Hosts and Clusters** and select the cluster on which host prep remediation failed (for example SDDC-Cluster1).
  3. Click **Configure > Configuration > VM/Host Rules**.
  4. Select **NSX Controller Anti-Affinity Rule** and click **Edit**.
  5. Select **Enable rule** and click **OK**.

  This completes the NSX Data Center for vSphere upgrade.
* **Upgrade precheck may fail as you approach the maximum number of supported ESXi hosts**

  In a large environment with many ESXi hosts, vSAN prechecks may fail.

  Workaround: Turn off vSAN prechecks.

  1. SSH to the SDDC Manager appliance as the **vcf** user.
  2. Enter `su` to switch to the root user.
  3. Turn off the vSAN prechecks:

     + Enter `vi /opt/vmware/vcf/lcm/lcm-app/conf/application-prod.properties`
     + In the VSAN CONFIGURATION section, set the following properties to false:
     + `vsan.healthcheck.enabled=false`
     + `vsan.hcl.update.enabled=false`
     + `vsan.precheck.enabled=false`
     + Save the changes.
  4. Restart LCM.

     `systemctl restart lcm`
* **Task panel does not show correct upgrade tasks for NSX-T workload domain upgrades**

  When you upgrade NSX-T workload domains. the task panel does not show upgrade status correctly. This is a UI issue only and there is no impact on the upgrade workflow.

  Workaround: Monitor upgrade status by navigating to the Update/Patches tab of the relevant workload domain:

  1. On the SDDC Manager Dashboard, click *Inventory* -> *Workload Domains*.
  2. In the Domain column, click the appropriate workload domain name.
  3. Click the *Update/Patches* tab.
  4. Monitor upgrade status.
* **Exception displayed when a scheduled NSX-T upgrade begins during an idle SDDC Manager session**

  When a scheduled NSX-T upgrade begins during an idle SDDC Manager session, the following UI exception is displayed: Retrieving NSXT upgrade failed with unknown exception

  This is a UI issue only. There is no impact on the upgrade workflow.

  Workaround: Refresh the web browser.
* **After upgrading to VMware Cloud Foundation 3.11 the NSX Edge password precheck is turned off**

  Enable the NSX Edge password precheck so that future upgrades of NSX-T based VI workload domains do not fail due to expired passwords.

  Workaround:

  1. SSH to the SDDC Manager appliance as the **vcf** user.
  2. Type `su` to switch to the root user.
  3. Edit the /opt/vmware/vcf/lcm/lcm-app/conf/feature.properties file as shown below:

     + `#feature flag for NSXT Edge VM Password Expiry Precheck`
     + `feature.lcm.nsxt.edge.password.validation=true`
  4. Run the following command: `systemctl restart lcm`

### vRealize Suite Known Issues

* **vRealize Operations Manager: VMware Security Advisory VMSA-2021-0018**

  [VMSA-2021-0018](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0018.html) describes security vulnerabilities that affect VMware Cloud Foundation.

  + The vRealize Operations Manager API contains an arbitrary file read vulnerability. A malicious actor with administrative access to vRealize Operations Manager API can read any arbitrary file on server leading to information disclosure.The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned identifier CVE-2021-22022 to this issue.
  + The vRealize Operations Manager API has insecure object reference vulnerability. A malicious actor with administrative access to vRealize Operations Manager API may be able to modify other users information leading to an account takeover.The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned identifier CVE-2021-22023 to this issue.
  + The vRealize Operations Manager API contains an arbitrary log-file read vulnerability. An unauthenticated malicious actor with network access to the vRealize Operations Manager API can read any log file resulting in sensitive information disclosure. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned identifier CVE-2021-22024 to this issue.
  + The vRealize Operations Manager API contains a broken access control vulnerability leading to unauthenticated API access. An unauthenticated malicious actor with network access to the vRealize Operations Manager API can add new nodes to existing vROps cluster. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned identifier CVE-2021-22025 to this issue.
  + The vRealize Operations Manager API contains a Server Side Request Forgery in multiple end points. An unauthenticated malicious actor with network access to the vRealize Operations Manager API can perform a Server Side Request Forgery attack leading to information disclosure. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned identifiers CVE-2021-22026 and CVE-2021-22027 to this issue.

  Workaround: See [KB 85452](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/85452) for information about applying vRealize Operations Security Patches that resolve the issues.
* **The password update for vRealize Automation and vRealize Operations Manager may run infinitely or may fail when the password contains special character "%"**

  Password management uses the vRealize Lifecycle Manager API to update the password of vRealize Automation and vRealize Operations Manager. When there is special character "%" in either of SSH or API or Administrator credential types of the vRealize Automation and vRealize Operations Manager users, then the vRealize Lifecycle Manager API hangs and doesn't respond to password management. There is a timeout of 5 mins and password management marks the operation as failed.

  Workaround:Retry the password update operation without the special character "%". Ensure that the passwords for all other vRealize Automation and vRealize Operations Manager accounts don't contain the "%" special character.

### Networking Known Issues

* **NSX Manager is not visible in the vSphere Web Client.**

  In addition to NSX Manager not being visible in the vSphere Web Client, the following error message displays in the NSX Home screen: "No NSX Managers available. Verify current user has role assigned on NSX Manager." This issue occurs when vCenter Server is not correctly configured for the account that is logged in.

  Workaround: To resolve this issue, follow the procedure detailed in Knowledge Base article 2080740 ["No NSX Managers available" error in the vSphere Web Client](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2080740).

### SDDC Manager Known Issues

* **Unable to delete VI workload domain enabled for vRealize Operations Manager from SDDC Manager.**

  Attempts to delete the vCenter adapter also fail, and return an SSL error.

  Workaround: Use the following procedure to resolve this issue.

  1. Create a vCenter adapter instance in vRealize Operations Manager, as described in [Configure a vCenter Adapter Instance in vRealize Operations Manager](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Operations-Manager/7.5/com.vmware.vcom.config.doc/GUID-19DAD6AF-7262-4655-B69F-6C665E33B52F.html). This step is required because the existing adapter was deleted by the failed workload domain deletion.
  2. Follow the procedure described in [Knowledge Base article 56946](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/56946).
  3. Restart the failed VI workload domain deletion workflow from the SDDC Manager interface.
* **APIs for managing SDDC cannot be executed from the SDDC Manager Dashboard**

  You cannot use the API Explorer in the SDDC Manager Dashboard to execute the APIs for managing SDDC (`/v1/sddc`).

  Workaround: None. These APIs can only be executed using the Cloud Builder as the host.

### Workload Domain Known Issues

* **Adding host fails when host is on a different VLAN**

  A host add operation can sometimes fail if the host is on a different VLAN.

  Workaround:

  1. Before adding the host, add a new portgroup to the VDS for that cluster.
  2. Tag the new portgroup with the VLAN ID of the host to be added.
  3. Add the Host. This workflow fails at the "Migrate host vmknics to dvs" operation.
  4. Locate the failed host in vCenter, and migrate the vmk0 of the host to the new portgroup you created in step 1. For more information, see [Migrate VMkernel Adapters to a vSphere Distributed Switch](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.networking.doc/GUID-0DE237B8-1938-4DE9-90EC-718E345B56A0.html) in the vSphere product documentation.
  5. Retry the Add Host operation.

  **NOTE**: If you later remove this host in the future, you must manually remove the portgroup as well if it is not being used by any other host.
* **NSX Manager for VI workload domain is not displayed in vCenter**

  Although NFS-based VI workload domains are created successfully, the NSX Manager VM is not registered in vCenter Server and is not displayed in vCenter.

  Workaround: To resolve this issue, use the following procedure:

  1. Log in to NSX Manager (http://<nsxmanager IP>).
  2. Navigate to **Manage > NSX Management Service**.
  3. Un-register the lookup service and vCenter, then re-register.
  4. Close the browser and log in to vCenter.
* **A vCenter Server on which certificates have been rotated is not accessible from a Horizon workload domain**

  VMware Cloud Foundation does not support the certificate rotation on the Horizon workload domains.

  Workaround: See KB article [70956](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/70956).
* **Deploying partner services on an NSX-T workload domain displays an error**

  Deploying partner services on an NSX-T workload domain such as McAfee or Trend displays the “Configure NSX at cluster level to deploy Service VM” error.

  Workaround: Attach the Transport node profile to the cluster and try deploying the partner service. After the service is deployed, detach the transport node profile from the cluster.
* **If the witness ESXi version does not match with the host ESXi version in the cluster, vSAN cluster partition may occur**

  vSAN stretch cluster workflow does not check the ESXi version of the witness host. If the witness ESXi version does not match the host version in the cluster, then vSAN cluster partition may happen.

  Workaround:

  1. Upgrade the witness host manually with the matching ESXi version using the vCenter VUM functionality.
  2. Replace or deploy the witness appliance matching with the ESXi version.
* **The certificate rotate operation on the second NSX-T domain fails**

  Certificate rotation works on the first NSX-T workload domain in your environment, but fails on all subsequent NSX-T workload domains.

  Workaround: None
* **Operations on NSX-T workload domains fails if their host FQDNs include uppercase letters**

  If the FQDNs of ESXi hosts in an NSX-T workload domain include uppercase letters, then the following operations may fail for the workload domain:

  + Add a host
  + Remove a host
  + Add a cluster
  + Remove a cluster
  + Delete the workload domain

  Workaround: See [KB 76553](http://kb.vmware.com/kb/76553).
* **VI workload domain creation or expansion operations fail**

  If there is a mismatch between the letter case (upper or lower) of an ESXi host's FQDN and the FQDN used when the host was commissioned, then workload domain creation and expansion may fail.

  Workaround: ESXi hosts should have lower case FQDNs and should be commissioned using lower case FQDNs.
* **Cluster is deleted even if VMs are up and running on the cluster**

  When you delete a cluster, it gets deleted even if there are VMs running on the cluster. This includes critical VMs such as Edge VMs, which may prevent you from accessing your environment after the cluster gets deleted.

  Workaround: Migrate the VMs to a different cluster before deleting the cluster.
* **Workload domain operations fail if cluster upgrade is in progress**

  Workload domain operations cannot be performed if one or more clusters are being upgraded. The UI does not block such oeprations during an upgrade.

  Workaround: Do not perform any operations on the workload domain when a cluster upgrade is in progress.
* **If you use the special character underscore (\_) in the vCenter Server host name for the workload domain create operation, the vCenter Server deployment fails**

  The vCenter deployment fails with the **"ERROR > Section 'new\_vcsa', subsection 'network', property 'system\_name' validation"** error message.

  Workaround: None. This is an issue in the vCenter Server product installer where the installer pre-validation fails. You should create the workload domain by providing valid vCenter Server host names.

### Multi-Instance Management Known Issues

* **Federation creation information not displayed if you leave the Multi-Instance Management Dashboard**

  Federation creation progress is displayed on the Multi-Instance Management Dashboard. If you navigate to another screen and then return to the Multi-Instance Management Dashboard, progress messages are not displayed. Instead, an empty map with no Cloud Foundation instances are displayed until the federation is created.

  Workaround: Stay on the Multi-Instance Dashboard till the task is complete. If you have navigated away, wait for around 20 minutes and then return to the dashboard by which time the operation should have completed.
* **The federation creation progress is not displayed**

  While federation creation is in progress, the SDDC manager UI displays the progress on the multi-site page. If you navigate into any other screen and come back to the multi-site screen, the progress messages are not displayed. An empty map with no VMware Cloud Foundation instances is displayed until the federation creation process completes.

  Workaround: None
* **Multi-Instance Management Dashboard operation fails**

  After a controller joins or leaves a federation, Kafka is restarted on all controllers in the federation. It can take up to 15 minutes for the federation to stabilize. Any operations performed on the dashboard during this time may fail.

  Workaround: Re-try the operation.

### Backup and Restore Known Issues

* **NSX Manager restore might not complete due to certificate rejection**

  A restore might not complete as a result of an installed certificate with no CRL Distribution Point and an incorrect setting (crl\_checking\_enable configuration to true).

  Workaround: None

Product Support Notices

Deprecation of Shares and Limit – IOPS fields in the virtual machine Edit Settings dialog: Starting from vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3p, the use of

Shares and Limit – IOPS fields in the virtual machine Edit Settings menu is deprecated, because all I/O settings are only defined by using a storage policy. In a

future vSphere release, the two fields are planned to be removed from the virtual machine Edit Settings dialog. For more information, see VMware knowledge

base article 85696 and About Virtual Machine Storage Policies.

Resolved Issues

The resolved issues are grouped as follows.

Miscellaneous Issues

Storage Issues

Security Issues

Installation, Upgrade and Migration Issues

Auto Deploy and Image Builder Issues

Server Configuration Issues

vSphere HA and Fault Tolerance Issues

Networking Issues

Virtual Machine Management Issues

Miscellaneous Issues

You do not receive email notifications for vCenter Server alarms

If you select the Keep the target's current state condition when you create an event-based alarm in your vCenter Server system, you might not receive email

notifications. The issue is specific to the Keep the target's current state condition.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vCenter Single Sign-On log files report errors about tomcat-users.xml

vCenter Single Sign-On log files at /storage/log might pile multiple errors similar to java.io.FileNotFoundException tomcat-users.xml (No such file or directory). As

a result, you see the /storage/log almost full.

This issue is resolved in this release.

You see warning messages for expiring password even though the account password is set to never expire

When you log in to your vCenter Server system with admin credentials by using either the vSphere Client or vSphere Web Client, you might see a warning

banner such as Your password will expire in (X) days, even though the password of the admin account is set to never expire.

This issue is resolved in this release.

You see an error in method invocation when updating vCenter Server Appliance by using the vCenter Server Appliance Management Interface

Due to an issue with the HTTPS proxy server configuration, when you click the Update tab in the vCenter Server Appliance Management Interface, you might see

the message Error in method Invocation.

This issue is resolved in this release.

The hostd service might fail during Network File Copy (NFC) operations

Due to a rare race condition, the hostd service might fail during Network File Copy (NFC) operations, used for virtual machine migration, such as Storage

vMotion, and workflows related to vSphere Replication.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Storage Issues

Multiple concurrent updates of First Class Disk (FCD) metadata might lead to metadata corruption

In case of multiple concurrent updates of FCD metadata, such as automated scripts that have multiple threads and they all update FCD metadata at the same

time, some updates might not complete. However, you see no notification of failure. As a result, FCD metadata might not be up-to-date and become inconsistent.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix adds in-memory locks for FCD metadata updates and a notification if a metadata update does not complete.

Operations with Cloud Native Storage (CNS) volumes on vCenter Server might fail due to a sync failure

If several FCDs fail at the same time, a full sync of CNS volumes might stop. As a result, some operations, such as to provision a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) in a

vCenter Server, cannot complete.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Blocked FCD operations might delay response to PersistentVolumeClaims

A rare race condition of the syncDatastore update objects in the internal datastoreQueue might block some FCD operations and delay response to

PersistentVolumeClaims. As a result, you might see vSAN health service not up to date.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure that no update objects are blocked during full sync operations.

Security Issues

vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3p delivers the following security updates:

The OpenSSL library is updated to version openssl- 1.0.2za.

The Oracle (Sun) JRE and JDK package is updated to version 1.8.0.301.

The Jackson package is updated to version 2.11.4.

The Apache Tomcat server is updated to version 8.5.68.

The Spring package is updated to version 4.3.30.

Eclipse Jetty is updated to version 9.4.43.v20210629.

The Cryptacular library is updated to version 1.2.4.

The XStream library is updated to version 1.4.18.

The urllib3 client is updated to version 1.21.1.

The Common Compress library is updated to version 1.21.

PostgreSQL is updated to version 9.4.26.

The libxml2 library is updated to version 2.9.12.

The c-ares library is updated to version 1.17.1.

cURL is updated to version 7.76.1.

Installation, Upgrade and Migration Issues

You cannot install a vCenter Server Appliance because the list of networks in the vSphere Client is empty

If a datacenter is nested in a data center folder, you do not see the list of available networks when you try to deploy a new vCenter Server Appliance by using

the vSphere Client.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Cold migration might fail for virtual machines with size larger than 1 TB

Cold migration of virtual machines that exceed 1TB in size might take long. As a result, the NFC client does not get updates from vCenter Server and might

consider the operation as timed out.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Auto Deploy and Image Builder Issues

Due to a caching issue, ESXi hosts might fail to boot from Auto Deploy after an upgrade to vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3p

After you upgrade your system to vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3p, stale cache data might cause Auto Deploy to stop provisioning ESXi hosts. The hosts fail with

an error such as Could not boot: HTTP 5xx Server Error.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Server Configuration Issues

Adding ESXi hosts to an Active Directory domain by using the VMware vSphere Authentication Proxy service might fail

Due to some additional permission checks from the vSphere Authentication Proxy service, adding an ESXi host to an Active Directory domain might fail. The

issue is specific for vSphere Authentication Proxy configurations where some users do not have Domain Admins privileges on the Active Directory.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix reduces the user access checks by the vSphere Authentication Proxy service to only the required minimum.

If the NT LAN Manager (NTLM) is disabled on Active Directory, configuration of the vSphere Authentication Proxy service might fail

You cannot configure the vSphere Authentication Proxy service on an Active Directory when NTLM is disabled, because by default the vSphere Authentication

Proxy uses NTLMv1 for initial communication.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix changes the default protocol for the initial communication of the vSphere Authentication Proxy to NTLMv2.

vSphere HA and Fault Tolerance Issues

You do not see an alarm when the secondary VM in a vSphere Fault Tolerance (FT) pair cannot power on

Even though you set a vCenter cannot start the Fault Tolerance secondary VM alarm in the vSphere Client or vSphere Web Client, you do not see the alarm when

the secondary VM that duplicates a mission critical virtual machine protected by FT fails to start.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Networking Issues

You cannot remove an ESXi host from а vSphere Distributed Switch (VDS)

In certain cases, you might not be able to remove an ESXi host from а VDS, even if no virtual machines are active on that host. The issue occurs when an ESXi

host enters maintenance mode and the vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) moves a virtual machine template to another host, but the VDS port does

not change. As a result, you cannot remove the host from VDS and might also see out of sync issues.

This issue is resolved in this release.

If device backing is not configured in a virtual NIC, the vpxd service might fail while creating a new virtual machine

If device backing is not configured in a virtual NIC, the vpxd service might not handle the null pointer value and fail while creating a new virtual machine. As a

result, you must restart vCenter Server.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix adds the exception vim.fault.InvalidDeviceBacking for such cases to prevent the vpxd service from failing.

You see an error in the vCenter Server network configuration from VAMI after a change to the maximum transmission unit (MTU) to less than 1280 bytes

After you change the MTU on a vSphere Distributed Switch to a size lower than 1280 bytes, you might see an error in the VAMI Networking screen such as

print.Error('com.vmware.applmgmt.err_operation_failed', 'Operation Failed.', **{}). The issue occurs when an IPV4 MTU gets a value lower than 1280, which

leads to disabling the IPv6 stack due to a faulty check logic, and causes networking APIs to fail.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Virtual Machine Management Issues

NEW: Deployment of virtual machines fails with an error Could not power on virtual machine: No space left on device

In rare cases, vSphere Storage DRS might over recommend some datastores and lead to an overload of those datastores, and imbalance of datastore clusters. In

extreme cases, power-on of virtual machines might fail due to swap file creation failure. In the vSphere Client or vSphere Web Client, you see an error such as

Could not power on virtual machine: No space left on device. You can backtrace the error in the /var/log/vmware/vpxd/drmdump directory.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Rare issue with the native snapshot enabled policy of virtual machines might cause the vpxd service to fail with a core dump

In certain conditions, the native snapshot enabled policy of virtual machines might cause the vpxd service to fail with a core dump pointing to an issue with

ReInitializeVmOpState in vmoperation.cpp. In the backtrace, you see logs similar to:

#9 0x000055d3eb5e2b0f in Vpxd::VmOperation::SetNativeSnapshotDisks (this=this@entry=0x7fc388a8ff00)   at bora/vpx/vpxd/vmcheck/vmOperation.cpp:648

#10 0x000055d3eb5e2b65 in Vpxd::VmOperation::ReInitializeVmOpState (this=this@entry=0x7fc388a8ff00,   checkState=checkState@entry=0x7fc388a90178) at

bora/vpx/vpxd/vmcheck/vmOperation.cpp:554

This issue is resolved in this release.

Known Issues

The known issues are grouped as follows.

Installation, Upgrade and Migration Issues

vCenter Server and vSphere Client Issues

Known Issues from Prior Releases

Installation, Upgrade and Migration Issues

If an external SQL database connected to your vCenter Server system does not support TLS 1.2, installation of or upgrade to vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3p

fails

The version of Oracle (Sun) JRE in vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3p requires TLS 1.2 support for external communication. As a result, if your system has external

SQL databases that do not support TLS 1.2, fresh installation or upgrades, or updates to vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3p fail. In the vpxd service logs, you see

errors similar to:

vpxd-svcs log snip

----2021-08-22T10:13:47.855-07:00 [main ERROR com.vmware.cis.core.kv.impl.Provider.VCDBProviderFactory opId=] SQL Error:

org.apache.commons.dbcp.SQLNestedException: Cannot create PoolableConnectionFactory (The driver could not establish a secure connection to SQL Server by using

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. Error: "The server selected protocol version TLS10 is not accepted by client preferences [TLS12]".

ClientConnectionId:xxxxxxxxx)

Workaround: Before installation or upgrades, or updates to vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3p, patch the external SQL servers to enable TLS 1.2 support.

Upgrade from vCenter Server 6.5.x to 6.7.x might not deploy anti-affinity rules, VM Overrides, and VM Restart Priority on new virtual machines

After an upgrade from vCenter Server 6.5.x to 6.7.x, you might see that existing anti-affinity rules, VM Overrides, and VM Restart Priority do not apply to new

VMs.

Workaround: Manually update the anti-affinity rules, VM Overrides and VM Restart Priority to make sure new VMs have the same rules and settings as old VMs.

vCenter Server and vSphere Client Issues

You see Certificate Status alarm in the vSphere Client for expiring certificates in the vSphere Certificate Manager Utility backup store

The VMware Certificate Manager uses the vSphere Certificate Manager Utility backup store (BACKUP_STORE) to support certificate revert, keeping only the

most recent state. However, the vpxd service throws a Certificate Status error when monitoring the BACKUP_STORE, if it contains any expired certificates, even

though this is expected.

Workaround: Delete the certificate entries in BACKUP_STORE by using the following vecs-cli commands:

1. Get expired certificate alias in BACKUP_STORE:

/usr/lib/vmware-vmafd/bin/vecs-cli entry list --store BACKUP_STORE --text

2. Delete certificate in BACKUP_STORE:

/usr/lib/vmware-vmafd/bin/vecs-cli entry delete --store BACKUP_STORE --alias <alias>

If an external SQL database connected to your vCenter Server system does not support TLS 1.2, installation of or upgrade to vCenter Server 6.5 Update 3r

fails

The version of Oracle (Sun) JRE in vCenter Server 6.5 Update 3r requires TLS 1.2 support for external communication. As a result, if your system has external SQL

databases that do not support TLS 1.2, fresh installation or upgrades, or updates to vCenter Server 6.5 Update 3r fail. In the vpxd service logs, you see errors

similar to:

Workaround: Before installation or upgrades, or updates to vCenter Server 6.5 Update 3r, patch the external SQL servers to enable TLS 1.2 support.

Virtual Machine Management Issues

Deployment of virtual machines fails with an error Could not power on virtual machine: No space left on device

In rare cases, vSphere Storage DRS might over recommend some datastores and lead to an overload of those datastores, and imbalance of datastore clusters. In

extreme cases, power-on of virtual machines might fail due to swap file creation failure. In the vSphere Client, you see an error such as Could not power on virtual

machine: No space left on device. You can backtrace the error in the/var/log/vmware/vpxd/drmdump directory.

Workaround: Manually relocate the VM to another datastore that has more space.
