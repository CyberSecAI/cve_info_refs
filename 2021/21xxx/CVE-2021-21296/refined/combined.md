```
- Fix the specific case that caused panic.
- Add panic handler around entire live query results handler. This will
  prevent similar issues from causing crashes in the future.

Note that other endpoints already have panic handling but this one is
special due to the use of websockets.
```

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<= 3.6.0

## Patched versions

3.7.0

## Description

### Impact

A malicious actor with a valid node key can send a badly formatted request that causes the Fleet server to exit, resulting in denial of service. This is possible only while a live query is currently ongoing.

We believe the impact of this vulnerability to be low given the requirement that the actor has a valid node key. There is no information disclosure, privilege escalation, or code execution.

### Patches

The issue is fixed in Fleet 3.7.0.

### Workarounds

If this attack is detected, revoke the node key (by deleting the associated host) that is being used to carry out the attack.
