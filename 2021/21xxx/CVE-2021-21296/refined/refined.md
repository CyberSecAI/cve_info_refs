Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21296:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A specific, badly formatted request sent by a node during a live query could cause a panic in the Fleet server's websocket handler, leading to a server exit. The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper error handling within the websocket handler for live query results.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient error handling in the websocket handler used for streaming live query results. Specifically, a panic occurs when a malformed result is processed.
- Lack of a panic handler around the entire live query results handler.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The server exits due to the panic, making the service unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious actor with a valid node key can send a crafted, badly formatted request over the websocket during an active live query to trigger the panic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must possess a valid node key, granting them the ability to connect to the Fleet server.
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests over the websocket while a live query is active.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Fleet versions 3.6.0 and earlier.
- The fix includes adding a panic handler around the entire live query results handler to prevent similar issues in the future.
- The issue was discovered and reported by @dsbaha.
- The vulnerability is considered to have low severity.
