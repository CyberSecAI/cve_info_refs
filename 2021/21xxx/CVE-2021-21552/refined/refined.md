Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an "improper authorization" issue within the Dell Wyse Windows Embedded System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authorization:** The system fails to properly restrict actions based on user privileges, allowing a low-privilege user to perform unauthorized actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing Restricted Environment:** A malicious user can circumvent the intended restrictions of the embedded system.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** The user can perform actions they are not authorized to do.
*   **Limited Confidentiality and Integrity Impact:** The CVSS score indicates low impact on confidentiality and integrity. There is no impact on availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Authenticated User:** The attacker must have valid user credentials and be able to authenticate locally on the system.
*   **Low Privileges:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a user with low privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The affected products include:
    *   Dell Wyse 5070 Thin Client
