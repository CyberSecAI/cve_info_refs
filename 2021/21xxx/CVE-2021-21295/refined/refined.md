{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `Http2MultiplexHandler` does not validate the `Content-Length` header present in the original HTTP/2 request, potentially leading to request smuggling when the request is proxied through as HTTP/1.1.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The lack of validation on the Content-Length header when converting HTTP/2 requests to HTTP/1.1 objects."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can smuggle requests inside the body as it gets downgraded from HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.1, potentially bypassing security measures, injecting malicious requests.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious actor sends a specially crafted HTTP/2 request with an incorrect Content-Length header."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP/2 requests and needs to have knowledge of a target system that proxies HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.1, along with any vulnerabilities it may have with regards to how it handles content-length.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered only when `Http2MultiplexCodec` or `Http2FrameCodec` is used in combination with `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec` and when the resulting HTTP/1.1 objects are forwarded to another remote peer. The vulnerability was addressed in Netty version 4.1.60. A system property `io.netty.http2.validateContentLength` has been added which allows to disable the more strict validation. The issue was related to CVE-2021-21295 and CVE-2021-21409."
