Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21357:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Improper input validation in the Form Designer backend module of the TYPO3 Form Framework. This allows attackers to bypass restrictions of predefined options and submit arbitrary data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** Attackers can bypass restrictions on form inputs.
*   **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation):** The system does not adequately validate user-supplied input.
*   **CWE-22 (Path Traversal):** Attackers can potentially write files to arbitrary directories on the server.
*  **CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type):** Attackers can upload files with arbitrary mime types.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Attackers can upload arbitrary files with any mime type.
*   Attackers can persist these files in any writable directory of the TYPO3 installation.
*   The vulnerability could lead to remote code execution if a malicious file is uploaded and subsequently executed.
*   The impact is rated as "High" severity.
*   CVSS score of 7.9 : `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H/E:H/RL:O/RC:C`

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploitable through the TYPO3 backend form designer module.
*   Attackers manipulate form input fields to bypass input restrictions.
*   Attackers can upload files using the form, specifying arbitrary mime types.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs a valid backend user account with access to the form module.
*   No user interaction is required other than the attacker's form submission.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The default `fileDenyPattern` of the Form Framework can successfully block files like `.htaccess` or `malicious.php`.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in TYPO3 versions 8.7.40, 9.5.25, 10.4.14, and 11.1.1.
*   The issue was reported by Richie Lee and fixed by Ralf Zimmermann.
