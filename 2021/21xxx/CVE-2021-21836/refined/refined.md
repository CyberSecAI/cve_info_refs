Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21836:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an integer overflow vulnerability in the `ctts_box_read` function within the GPAC library when processing an atom with the "ctts" FOURCC code. This overflow occurs when calculating the size of the memory to allocate for entries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Integer Overflow:** A 32-bit integer representing the number of entries is multiplied by the size of the `GF_DttsEntry` structure. On 32-bit platforms, this multiplication can result in an integer overflow, leading to a smaller-than-expected memory allocation.
- **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow:** After an undersized buffer is allocated, the code proceeds to read data from the input stream into this buffer. Because the buffer is smaller than required, this leads to a heap-based buffer overflow when the input data is written past the allocated memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Corruption:** The heap-based buffer overflow corrupts memory, potentially overwriting adjacent heap structures.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By carefully crafting a malicious MPEG-4 input file, an attacker could potentially overwrite function pointers or other critical data structures on the heap, allowing them to execute arbitrary code within the context of the application using the vulnerable library.
- **Denial of Service:** Even if arbitrary code execution is not achieved, the memory corruption could lead to application crashes, resulting in denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious MPEG-4 File:** The primary attack vector is providing the vulnerable application or library a specially crafted MPEG-4 file.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when the application attempts to parse the crafted file. This can be done through social engineering, where an attacker tricks the victim into opening the malicious video.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **File Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a valid-looking MPEG-4 file with malicious content.
- **User Interaction/Social Engineering:** The attacker must trick a user into opening the malicious file with a vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability lies in the following code snippet:

```c
src/isomedia/box_code_base.c:386
GF_Err ctts_box_read(GF_Box *s, GF_BitStream *bs)
{
    u32 i;
    u32 sampleCount;
    GF_CompositionOffsetBox *ptr = (GF_CompositionOffsetBox *)s;

    ISOM_DECREASE_SIZE(ptr, 4);
    ptr->nb_entries = gf_bs_read_u32(bs);                                               // [20] read u32 from input

    if (ptr->nb_entries > ptr->size / 8) {                                              // [20] check entries againsti nput
        GF_LOG(GF_LOG_ERROR, GF_LOG_CONTAINER, ("[iso file] Invalid number of entries %d in ctts\n", ptr->nb_entries));
        return GF_ISOM_INVALID_FILE;
    }

    ptr->alloc_size = ptr->nb_entries;                                                  // [21] assign number of entries to "alloc_size" field
    ptr->entries = (GF_DttsEntry *)gf_malloc(sizeof(GF_DttsEntry)*ptr->alloc_size);     // [20] calculate size of allocation using "alloc_size" field
    if (!ptr->entries) return GF_OUT_OF_MEM;
    sampleCount = 0;
    for (i=0; i<ptr->nb_entries; i++) {
        ISOM_DECREASE_SIZE(ptr, 8);
        ptr->entries[i].sampleCount = gf_bs_read_u32(bs);                               // [22] read entries from atom into undersized array
        if (ptr->version)
            ptr->entries[i].decodingOffset = gf_bs_read_int(bs, 32);
        else
            ptr->entries[i].decodingOffset = (s32) gf_bs_read_u32(bs);
...
    }
...
    return GF_OK;
}
```
Specifically:

1.  `ptr->nb_entries` is read as a `u32` value.
2.  A check `ptr->nb_entries > ptr->size / 8` against a 64-bit size is performed, which is not sufficient for overflow prevention.
3.  `ptr->alloc_size = ptr->nb_entries;` assigns this value to a separate variable of type `u32`.
4.  `ptr->entries = (GF_DttsEntry *)gf_malloc(sizeof(GF_DttsEntry)*ptr->alloc_size);` The `alloc_size`, a 32-bit value, is multiplied by `sizeof(GF_DttsEntry)`. On 32 bit systems, this multiplication can result in an integer overflow.
5.  The loop that follows reads data into the allocated buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is specific to 32-bit platforms. 64-bit platforms may not be affected by the integer overflow due to the larger address space and register size used in arithmetic operations.
- The provided proof-of-concept for this vulnerability triggers a crash due to a zero sized allocation
- The report also notes that other vulnerabilities are present in the same library.
