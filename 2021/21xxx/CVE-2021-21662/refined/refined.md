Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21662:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin, versions 10.0.1 and earlier, fails to perform a permission check within a form validation method.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Permission Check:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of proper permission checks in a form validation method. This allows unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credentials ID Enumeration:** An attacker with "Overall/Read" permission can enumerate the IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. These enumerated IDs can then be used in further attacks.
- **Potential for Credentials Capture:** Although not directly a vulnerability that allows capturing credentials, the vulnerability can be chained with other vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-21663, CVE-2021-21664, CVE-2021-21665), where the enumerated credential IDs are used to capture credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based and involves sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable form validation endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs "Overall/Read" permission within the Jenkins environment. This implies that the attacker must have already gained some level of authorized access to the Jenkins instance.

**Additional Notes:**
- This CVE is related to a series of vulnerabilities found in the XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin.
- The missing permission check is a separate issue from the CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2021-21665) and incorrect permission check (CVE-2021-21664) also present in the same plugin.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 10.0.2 of the XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin.
