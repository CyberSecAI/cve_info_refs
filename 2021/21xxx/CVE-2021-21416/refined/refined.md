{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The django-registration package, prior to version 3.1.2, did not properly filter sensitive data from error reports.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Sensitive data, including user credentials like passwords, could be included in detailed error reports.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exposure of sensitive user data (e.g., passwords) to recipients of error reports.",
  "Attack vectors": "Server-side errors during user account registration, leading to the generation of detailed error reports.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not directly exploit the vulnerability. Instead, a server-side error needs to occur during the registration process and the attacker gains access to the error reports (e.g., developers receiving emailed error reports)."
