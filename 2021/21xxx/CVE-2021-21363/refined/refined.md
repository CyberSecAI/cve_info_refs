The provided content relates to CVE-2021-21363.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a race condition when creating a temporary directory. The code first creates a temporary file, then deletes it, and then creates a directory with the same name. This sequence of actions allows a local attacker to create their own directory in the same location, potentially before the application does, thus enabling a local privilege escalation vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Race condition vulnerability when creating temporary directories using `File.createTempFile`, `delete`, and `mkdir` calls
- Creation of a temporary file/directory with insecure permissions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Local Privilege Escalation: An attacker can control the contents of the temporary output folder, which can lead to execution of arbitrary attacker-controlled code when the application executes code from that directory.
- An attacker can overwrite the temporary directory created by the vulnerable application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local attack, where a malicious user has access to the same system as the vulnerable application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Must be a user co-located on the same system as the vulnerable application.
- Must be able to observe the process of temporary directory creation in order to exploit the race condition.
