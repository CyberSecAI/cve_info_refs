# Generator Web Application: Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability via System Temp Directory

Critical

[frantuma](/frantuma)
published
GHSA-pc22-3g76-gm6j
Mar 9, 2021

## Package

maven

swagger-codegen
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 2.4.19

## Patched versions

2.4.19+

## Description

### Impact

On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. A collocated user can observe the process of creating a temporary sub directory in the shared temporary directory and race to complete the creation of the temporary subdirectory.

This vulnerability is local privilege escalation because the contents of the `outputFolder` can be appended to by an attacker. As such, code written to this directory, when executed can be attacker controlled.

#### Java Code

The method `File.createTempFile` from the JDK is vulnerable to this local information disclosure vulnerability.

[swagger-codegen/modules/swagger-generator/src/main/java/io/swagger/generator/online/Generator.java](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/blob/068b1ebcb7b04a48ad38f1cadd24bb3810c9f1ab/modules/swagger-generator/src/main/java/io/swagger/generator/online/Generator.java#L174-L185)

> ```

> File outputFolder = File.createTempFile("codegen-", "-tmp"); // Attacker knows the full path of the file that will be generated
> // delete the file that was created
> outputFolder.delete(); // Attacker sees file is deleted and begins a race to create their own directory before Swagger Code Generator.
> // and make a directory of the same name
> // SECURITY VULNERABILITY: Race Condition! - Attacker beats Swagger Code Generator and now owns this directory
> outputFolder.mkdirs();
> ```
>
> This vulnerability is local privilege escalation because the contents of the `outputFolder` can be appended to by an attacker. As such, code written to this directory, when executed can be attacker controlled.
>
> The fix here is to switch to the `Files` API for creating temporary directories. Which does not contain this race condition, and appropriately sets the correct file permissions.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
