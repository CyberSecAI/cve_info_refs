Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21362:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing user policy enforcement in the `PostPolicyHandler` of MinIO. This handler was not properly checking user permissions when processing POST requests with a policy, allowing users to bypass configured read-only policies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The core issue was that the `PostPolicyHandler` didn't validate user policies before allowing uploads via POST requests with a policy. This meant that even if a user was configured with a read-only policy, they could upload files by crafting a specific POST request with an upload policy.
- **Inconsistent Enforcement:** User policies were enforced in other parts of the system but were not correctly implemented in the `PostPolicyHandler`, leading to inconsistent access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypassing Read-Only Policies:** A user with a read-only policy could bypass these restrictions and upload objects to a bucket. This could lead to data modification or unauthorized data uploads, violating the intended access control configurations.
- **Privilege Escalation:** While not a traditional privilege escalation, this could be used to elevate a user's capabilities beyond their intended permissions, causing potential issues with data integrity and potentially security.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted POST Requests:** The attack vector involves crafting a POST request to the MinIO server with `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`, including a policy and signature, to upload files.
- **`mc share upload` command:** The vulnerability can be triggered by using the `mc share upload` command, which generates a URL that when used allows an upload that ignores user policies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid MinIO User:** The attacker needs to be a valid MinIO user.
- **Knowledge of MinIO API:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of the MinIO API to generate the required POST request or use the `mc share upload` command.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the MinIO server to send the crafted POST requests.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in release `RELEASE.2021-03-04T00-53-13Z`.
- The fix involved adding the necessary user policy checks in `PostPolicyHandler` and ensuring that the user permissions were correctly validated.
- The provided content includes a test case that illustrates how a user with a read-only policy could bypass the policy using a generated `mc share upload` URL, demonstrating the vulnerability.
- The fix was implemented in the commit `039f59b552319fcc2f83631bb421a7d4b82bc482` and merged via pull request `#11682`.
