Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-21944

**Vulnerability Description:**
The document describes a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the TIFF parser of Accusoft ImageGear 19.10. This vulnerability (and a related one CVE-2021-21945) occurs due to a missing boundary check when processing specially crafted TIFF files with specific tag requirements.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a missing boundary check in the `FUN_10074d50` function when processing a TIFF image with `BitsPerSample` equal to `0xc` and a `PlanarConfiguration` tag equal to 2. The function copies data from a source buffer (`src_buff`) to a destination buffer (`dest_buff`). Due to a specific writing pattern involving 12 bits from src_buff written to 16 bit chunks of dest_buff, and a calculation of `dest_buff` offsets using `SamplesPerPixel`, an out-of-bounds write can occur if the provided image parameters are crafted maliciously.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The vulnerability stems from writing data beyond the allocated boundary of the `dest_buff`.
- **Missing boundary check:** The code lacks proper checks to prevent out-of-bounds writes during the data copying process.
- **Writing pattern vulnerability**: Specifically, the writing pattern of 12 bits from source to 16 bits of destination, combined with a non sequential offset, makes the application vulnerable

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Heap corruption:** A successful exploit could lead to corruption of the heap, potentially causing application crashes or allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious TIFF file:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted TIFF file to an application using the vulnerable ImageGear library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious TIFF file to an application using Accusoft ImageGear 19.10. No other special privileges or capabilities are mentioned as being required.

**Additional Details:**
- The document provides specific details on how the vulnerability is triggered, including the required TIFF tags (`SamplesPerPixel` > 2, `BitsPerSample` == 0xc, `PlanarConfiguration` == 2, and either `TileOffsets` or `StripOffsets` with N > 1), and the vulnerable functions (`FUN_10074d50` and `TIFF_parse`).
- It explains how the `dest_buff` and `src_buff` are allocated and how their sizes, influenced by TIFF tag values, contribute to the overflow.
- The document also provides example values to demonstrate how an out-of-bounds write is calculated and where the access violation occurs within the code.
