Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-21353:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the `pretty` option within the `pug-code-gen` library, specifically when handling mixin blocks and mixins. This option, intended for controlling whitespace in the generated HTML, was directly used in string concatenation without proper escaping or sanitization. This allowed the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code when rendering templates using the `pug` templating engine.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Code Injection:** The primary weakness was the lack of input sanitization on the `pretty` option when creating JavaScript code for the Pug templates. This allowed a malicious user to inject arbitrary JavaScript code through the `pretty` parameter.
- **Unsafe String Concatenation:** The code directly concatenated the unescaped `pretty` option into strings that were later executed as JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A remote attacker who could control the `pretty` option in the Pug compiler could achieve remote code execution on the Node.js backend. This would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Control of `pretty` Option:** The attack vector involves gaining control over the `pretty` option passed to the Pug compiler. This could be achieved in various ways, such as:
    - Spreading a user-provided object (e.g., query parameters from a web request) directly into the Pug template input.
    - Using user-controlled data from a database or configuration files that are used as the pug options.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Influence Pug Options:** The attacker must be able to manipulate the `pretty` option of the Pug compiler.
- **Backend Access (indirect):** The attacker does not require direct access to the server but must influence the template rendering process through the application's input mechanisms.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects `pug` versions prior to 3.0.1 and `pug-code-gen` versions prior to 2.0.3 and between 3.0.0 and 3.0.2.
- Patched versions include `pug@3.0.1`, `pug-code-gen@3.0.2`, and `pug-code-gen@2.0.3`
- The fix involved sanitizing and escaping the `pretty` option to prevent code injection.
- Workarounds involved ensuring no un-trusted input was passed to Pug as the `pretty` option, such as pre-compiling templates before applying user input.
- The issue was originally reported in [pugjs/pug#3312](https://github.com/pugjs/pug/issues/3312) and fixed in [pugjs/pug#3314](https://github.com/pugjs/pug/pull/3314).
