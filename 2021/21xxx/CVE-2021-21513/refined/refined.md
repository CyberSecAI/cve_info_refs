### Summary of CVE-2021-21513

Based on the provided content, this CVE relates to an authentication bypass vulnerability in Dell EMC OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA).

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way OMSA handles authentication when the "Managed System Login" feature is enabled. Specifically, when a user provides "localhost" as the target system in the login form, the OMSA web server makes a WS-Management connection to the local Remote Enablement component. This connection does not properly validate user credentials, allowing login with any username and password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authentication checks when connecting to the local Remote Enablement component via the Managed System Login page, allowing an attacker to log in with any credentials.
*   **Insecure Handling of Local Connections:** The system fails to differentiate between remote and local connections when authenticating via the Managed System Login, treating a connection to localhost as if it were a remote system.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The webserver does not validate the username and password against a local user database when connecting to localhost.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Administrative Access:** Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to gain administrative access to the OMSA interface.
*   **Full System Control:** The attacker can perform any operations available through OMSA, such as adding administrative users for the Integrated Dell Remote Access Controller (iDRAC), thus gaining full control of the server.
*   **Lateral Movement:** After gaining access to OMSA, the attacker can perform further actions to compromise the server including administrative access to iDRAC.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network via the OMSA web interface (typically listening on port 1311).
*   **Web Browser:** An attacker uses a web browser to access the OMSA login page.
*   **HTTP Requests:**  Attackers can bypass the authentication by crafting specific HTTP requests to the OMSA web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the OMSA web server.
*   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need to know valid user credentials. They only need to specify "localhost" in the target IP address, and any arbitrary username and password.
*   **Knowledge of the OMSA Interface:** The attacker needs to be aware of the Managed System Login page and the related fields.

**Additional Information:**

*   The "Managed System Login" feature must be enabled for the vulnerability to be exploitable. This feature is disabled by default in OMSA version 9.5.0.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited with a simple CURL command, highlighting how easily an attacker can take advantage of the flaw.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Tenable.
*   Patches were released by Dell to address the vulnerability in version 9.4.0.3 and 9.5.0.1.
