# Dell EMC OpenManage Server Administrator Authentication Bypass

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

When the OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA) Web Server and Remote Enablement components are installed on a Dell EMC device and the Managed System Login feature is enabled (disabled by default in v9.5.0), an unauthenticated remote attacker can login to OMSA as admin without knowing a correct OS username and password on that system.

When the Managed System Login feature is enabled, the OMSA web server presents a Managed System Login page. In this case, the web server can be used to connect to a remote node/system. It takes the IP/hostname of the remote node, a username and the password and makes an HTTPS WS-Management (i.e., WinRM) connection to the Remote Enablement component on the remote node in order to login to and manage the node.

If the IP/hostname of the remote node is set to localhost, the web server makes a WS-Management connection to the Remote Enablement component on the same host on which the web server is running. It's been observed that any user name and password would work.

#### Proof of Concept

To perform the authentication bypass, the attacker does the following:

* Use a web browser to fetch https://:1311/
* Switch to the Manage System Login page (by clicking on the Manage Remote Node link)
* Use localhost in the Hostname / IP address field
* Specify any username (i.e., AAAA) in the Username field
* Specify any password (i.e., BBBB) in the Password field
* Check the "Ignore certificate warnings" check box
* Hit the Submit button

The following CURL command shows a successful OMSA login without knowing a correct username and password, as the response is an HTTP redirect to OMSAStart as opposed to a login page (i.e., omalogin.html).

```

curl -ki -d 'manuallogin=true&targetmachine=localhost&user=AAAA&password=BBBB&application=omsa&ignorecertificate=1' 'https://<omsa_webserver>:1311/LoginServlet?flag=true&managedws=false'

```

And the log shows more details about the successful authentication bypass login:

```

Under the hood, a getwsmanclient command was sent to login to the remote node. Because the IP/hostname of the remote node was set to localhost, the getwsmanclient command was sent to the local host and it was successful (WSManStatus = 0) even an invalid username and password were used.

Then a getuserrightsonly command was sent to get the user rights for the specified user account (AAAA). That command was also successful (WSManStatus = 0), and the account has user rights 7, which is the highest.

After logging in without knowing a correct username and password, the attacker can perform all operations designed in OMSA. For example, s/he can add an administrative user for the Integrated Dell Remote Access Controller (iDRAC) on the Dell server. The attacker can then login to iDRAC with administrative privileges.

### Solution

Upgrade to version 9.4.0.3 or 9.5.0.1

  ###### medium

  GitHub Desktop is an open-source Electron-based GitHub app designed for git development. An attacker convincing a user to clone a repository directly or through a submodule can allow the attacker access to the user's credentials through the use of maliciously crafted remote URL. GitHub Desktop relies on Git to perform all network related operations (such as cloning, fetching, and pushing). When a user attempts to clone a repository GitHub Desktop will invoke `git clone` and when Git encounters a remote which requires authentication it will request the credentials for that remote host from GitHub Desktop using the git-credential protocol. Using a maliciously crafted URL it's possible to cause the credential request coming from Git to be misinterpreted by Github Desktop such that it will send credentials for a different host than the host that Git is currently communicating with thereby allowing for secret exfiltration. GitHub username and OAuth token, or credentials for other Git remote hosts stored in GitHub Desktop could be improperly transmitted to an unrelated host. Users should update to GitHub Desktop 3.4.12 or greater which fixes this vulnerability. Users who suspect they may be affected should revoke any relevant credentials.

  ###### medium

  A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in wuzhicms 4.1.0. This affects the function test of the file coreframe/app/search/admin/config.php. The manipulation of the argument sphinxhost/sphinxport leads to server-side request forgery. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.
* ##### [CVE-2024-52005](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-52005)

  ###### high

  Git is a source code management tool. When cloning from a server (or fetching, or pushing), informational or error messages are transported from the remote Git process to the client via the so-called "sideband channel". These messages will be prefixed with "remote:" and printed directly to the standard error output. Typically, this standard error output is connected to a terminal that understands ANSI escape sequences, which Git did not protect against. Most modern terminals support control sequences that can be used by a malicious actor to hide and misrepresent information, or to mislead the user into executing untrusted scripts. As requested on the git-security mailing list, the patches are under discussion on the public mailing list. Users are advised to update as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade should avoid recursive clones unless they are from trusted sources.

  ###### high

  In Yubico pam-u2f before 1.3.1, local privilege escalation can sometimes occur. This product implements a Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) that can be deployed to support authentication using a YubiKey or other FIDO compliant authenticators on macOS or Linux. This software package has an issue that allows for an authentication bypass in some configurations. An attacker would require the ability to access the system as an unprivileged user.
