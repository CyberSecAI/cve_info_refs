- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow in the `process_fontname` function due to an unbounded `sprintf` call.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `process_fontname` function uses a fixed-size buffer (`b_ovf` of 256 bytes) and an unbounded `sprintf` call to copy a string from the PDF file, without checking if the length of the copied string exceeds the size of the buffer, leading to a stack buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can provide a malicious PDF file to trigger the vulnerability. Specifically, a crafted PDF file with a `fontname` string larger than 256 bytes within the PDF object that contains the `FontDescriptor` flag will trigger the overflow when parsed by the vulnerable software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted PDF file to the vulnerable application.
