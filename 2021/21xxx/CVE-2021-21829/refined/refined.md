- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `EnumerationUncompressor::UncompressItem` function of the Xmill library, where a length value read from the compressed XML file is used without validation in a `memcpy` operation when writing to the output buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the lack of input length validation before performing `memcpy` operation in the `Output::StoreData` function which is called by `XMLOutput::characters` which is in turn called by `EnumerationUncompressor::UncompressItem`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit can lead to remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can provide a specially crafted malicious XMI file to trigger the vulnerability during the decompression process within the `Uncompress` function of Xdemill.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious file to the application using the vulnerable library.
