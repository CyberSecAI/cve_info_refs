- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of IOCTL `0x9c40a148` within the `Monitor_win10_x64.sys` driver of IOBit Advanced SystemCare Ultimate. Specifically, the driver passes user-controlled data to the `HalSetBusDataByOffset` function without proper constraints.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation for data passed to `HalSetBusDataByOffset`. This allows an unprivileged user to read arbitrary I/O device configurations and device-specific registers. The driver also has an exposed device object that is readable and writable by everyone.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information by reading the configuration of various I/O devices.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can send a specially crafted I/O request packet (IRP) to the driver via the device object `\Device\IOBIT_WinRing0_1_3_0` to trigger the vulnerable IOCTL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to send IRPs to the device object, which can be done from an unprivileged user context.
