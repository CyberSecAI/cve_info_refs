The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21778.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the message length during ASDU message processing in the `lib60870.NET` library. Specifically, the code checks if the remaining message length is smaller than the expected header size but throws an exception that causes the application to crash when a malformed message is received.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The library fails to handle messages with insufficient length gracefully.
- **Uncaught Exception:** The `ASDUParsingException` is not handled, leading to application termination.
- **Reachable Assertion:** The check acts as an assertion because it terminates the application upon failure rather than a proper error handling and recovery mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a crafted message with a smaller-than-expected length, resulting in the application crashing.
- **Loss of Communication:** The crash terminates the application and disrupts communication until a manual restart is performed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted network request.
- **Unauthenticated Message:** An attacker does not need authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send network requests to the target system.
- **No Authentication:** No prior knowledge or credentials are required to exploit this vulnerability.
