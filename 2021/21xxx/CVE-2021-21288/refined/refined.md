{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The CarrierWave download feature was vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This allowed attackers to make requests to internal resources by providing a malicious URL.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The application did not properly validate or sanitize the provided URL, allowing for the construction of requests to internal network resources.",
       "Lack of proper SSRF protection."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gather information about the internal network infrastructure of the platform by providing a URL pointing to internal DNS entries or IP addresses. This could potentially lead to further attacks against the internal network.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could provide a malicious URL to the CarrierWave download feature. This URL would be processed by the application, causing a request to be made to the attacker-controlled resource on the internal network.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a URL to the vulnerable application."
  },
  "patches": [
    "Upgrade to version 2.1.1 or 1.3.2 of the `carrierwave` gem."
