{
  "CVE-2021-21828": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in the `CurPath::AddLabel` function, where a global pointer is incremented to store `TLabelID` values without proper bounds checking. This allows writing 2-byte chunks to a global buffer, potentially leading to control of the instruction pointer.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution through control of the instruction pointer.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "A specially crafted XMI file, when decompressed, triggers the vulnerability."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to provide a malicious XMI file."
  }
}
