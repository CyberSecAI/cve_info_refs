The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21915 and describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Advantech R-SeeNet application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerabilities are caused by the misuse of prepared statements combined with SQL concatenation. Variables, despite initial sanitization, lose their protection when used to construct SQL queries within stored procedures. Specifically, the final prepared statement is taken from an unsanitized variable, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- Improper neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
- Data exfiltration
- Data modification or deletion
- Potential compromise of the underlying system.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerabilities can be triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the ‘group_list’ page. The vulnerable parameters include 'company_filter', 'description_filter', and 'ord'.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the R-SeeNet application.
- The vulnerabilities can also be exploited through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**More Details than CVE description:**
The provided content gives specific vulnerable parameters, code snippets, and example exploitation requests, which is more detail than the description in a typical CVE entry.
