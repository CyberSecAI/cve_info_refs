    "summary": "This document describes a high severity denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability in Tendermint Core versions 0.34.0 - 0.34.2, identified as CVE-2021-21271. The vulnerability arises from inconsistent timestamping of `DuplicateVoteEvidence` objects across different nodes, which leads to the generation of invalid evidence and subsequent node disconnections. The issue was resolved in v0.34.3.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause lies in the `consensus` reactor's responsibility for forming `DuplicateVoteEvidence` objects, which are assigned a timestamp using the 'last commit' of the current block, which is still 'in flight' and thus inconsistent across different nodes. This leads to the creation of `DuplicateVoteEvidence` with differing timestamps.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Inconsistent timestamp generation for `DuplicateVoteEvidence` objects.",
        "Potential for nodes to create invalid `DuplicateVoteEvidence` objects due to differing timestamps, leading to node disconnections and potential DoS"
      ],
      "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) vector. Nodes proposing invalid evidence can be disconnected by their peers, effectively halting the network.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A double-signing event (Byzantine behavior) triggers the generation of `DuplicateVoteEvidence`.",
         "A malicious actor can exploit this by deliberately creating double signs."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "A malicious validator is required, who can perform double signing and cause an inconsistent state amongst different nodes."
