| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 6.5, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [VMware](https://www.vmware.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Workstation |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of VMware Workstation. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the ThinPrint component. Crafted data in a font file can result in an integer overflow before reading from memory. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | VMware has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

##### **1. Impacted Products**

* VMware Workstation Pro / Player (Workstation)
* VMware Horizon Client for Windows

##### **2. Introduction**

Multiple vulnerabilities in VMware Workstation and Horizon Client for Windows were privately reported to VMware. Updates and workarounds are available to remediate these vulnerabilities in affected VMware products.

##### **3. Multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities via Cortado ThinPrint (CVE-2021-21987, CVE-2021-21988, CVE-2021-21989)**

**Description**

VMware Workstation and Horizon Client for Windows contain multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in the Cortado ThinPrint component. These issues exist in the TTC and JPEG2000 parsers. VMware has evaluated the severity of these issues to be in the [low severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a CVSSv3 base score of [3.2](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N).

**Known Attack Vectors**

A malicious actor with access to a virtual machine or remote desktop may be able to exploit these issues leading to information disclosure from the TPView process running on the system where Workstation or Horizon Client for Windows is installed.

**Resolution**

To remediate CVE-2021-21987 (TTC parser), CVE-2021-21988 (JPEG2000 parser) and CVE-2021-21989 (TTC parser) apply the patches listed in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Response Matrix' found below.

**Workarounds**

None.

**Additional Documentation**

None.

**Notes**

Exploitation is only possible if virtual printing has been enabled. This feature is not enabled by default on Workstation but it is enabled by default on Horizon Client for Windows.

**Acknowledgements**

VMware would like to thank Anonymous working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative for reporting these issues (CVE-2021-21987, CVE-2021-21988 and CVE-2021-21989) and Hou JingYi (@hjy79425575) of Qihoo 360 for reporting CVE-2021-21987 to us.
