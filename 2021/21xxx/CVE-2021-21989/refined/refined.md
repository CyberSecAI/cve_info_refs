Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-21989:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Integer overflow in the ThinPrint component when processing a crafted font file (TTC parser).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Integer overflow leading to out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Information disclosure from the TPView process, running on the system where Workstation or Horizon Client is installed.
*   The vulnerability could potentially be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Local attacker: An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system.
*   Malicious data: Crafted font file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system.
*   The target system must have virtual printing enabled. (Enabled by default in Horizon Client for Windows, not by default in Workstation)

**Additional Notes:**
*  The vulnerability exists within the Cortado ThinPrint component, specifically in the TTC parser.
*  The vulnerability is related to the processing of font files.
*  VMware has released patches to remediate this issue.
*  This vulnerability is categorized as low severity with a CVSSv3 base score of 3.2 according to VMware, and 6.5 according to ZDI. The difference is due to different attack vector and privilege requirements identified.
