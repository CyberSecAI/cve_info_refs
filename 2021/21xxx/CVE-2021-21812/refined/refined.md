The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21812.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `HandleFileArg` function of AT&T Labs' Xmill 0.7 when processing command-line arguments. Specifically, the `strcpy` function is used to copy user-supplied file path data into a fixed-size buffer (`fullpath`) without any bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow due to the use of `strcpy` without length checks.
- Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when the input `filepattern` does not contain any meta characters ('*' or '?'), which leads the code to copy it directly into a fixed-size buffer using `strcpy`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by overflowing the stack buffer.
- This can lead to complete control of the vulnerable application, potentially compromising the system on which it is running.

**Attack vectors:**
- By supplying a long filename as a command line argument to the `xmill.exe` executable

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the vulnerable application with control over the command-line arguments. This would typically involve local access to the system, but could also be exploited remotely if the application was somehow exposed.
