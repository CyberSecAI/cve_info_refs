# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2021-1238

## Webkit WebCore::GraphicsContext use-after-free vulnerability

##### June 2, 2021

##### CVE Number

CVE-2021-21779

### Summary

A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the way Webkit’s GraphicsContext handles certain events in WebKitGTK 2.30.4. A specially crafted web page can lead to a potential information leak and further memory corruption. A victim must be tricked into visiting a malicious web page to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Webkit WebKitGTK 2.30.4

### Product URLs

<https://webkit.org/>

### CVSSv3 Score

6.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L

### CWE

CWE-416 - Use After Free

### Details

WebKit is an open-source web content engine for browsers and other applications.

The vulnerability lies in how WebKit handles function `fillText`. From documentation:
`The CanvasRenderingContext2D method fillText() draws a text string at the specified coordinates, filling the string's characters with the current fillStyle. An optional parameter allows specifying a maximum width for the rendered text`
The CanvasRenderingContext2D is created from HTMLCanvasElement by calling function `getContext('2d')`.

Canvas element itself is HTMLCanvasElement and posesses attributes called `width` and `height`. This vulnerability is due to `height` attribute.

```
1:  RETURN_IF_EXCEPTION(throwScope, encodedJSValue());
2:  if (UNLIKELY(impl.callTracingActive()))
3:      CallTracer::recordCanvasAction(impl, "fillText"_s, { text, x, y, maxWidth });
4:  throwScope.release();
5:  impl.fillText(WTFMove(text), WTFMove(x), WTFMove(y), WTFMove(maxWidth));
6:  return JSValue::encode(jsUndefined());

```

At line 5 above, Webkit takes `text` as the 1st argument to fillText function, while 2nd and 3rd arguments are intigers `18428` and `20441` respectively.

Then code execution proceeds to method `CanvasRenderingContext2D::drawTextInternal`:

```
1:  void CanvasRenderingContext2D::drawTextInternal(const String& text, float x, float y, bool fill, Optional<float> maxWidth)
2:  {
3:  if (RuntimeEnabledFeatures::sharedFeatures().webAPIStatisticsEnabled())
4:      ResourceLoadObserver::shared().logCanvasWriteOrMeasure(this->canvas().document(), text);
5:
6:  if (!canDrawTextWithParams(x, y, fill, maxWidth))
7:      return;
8:
9:  String normalizedText = text;
10:  normalizeSpaces(normalizedText);
11:
12:  const RenderStyle* computedStyle;
13:  auto direction = toTextDirection(state().direction, &computedStyle);
14:  bool override = computedStyle ? isOverride(computedStyle->unicodeBidi()) : false;
15:
16:  TextRun textRun(normalizedText, 0, 0, AllowRightExpansion, direction, override, true);
17:  drawTextUnchecked(textRun, x, y, fill, maxWidth);
18:  }

```

At line 6, function checks if the passed width and height are within range.

```
1:  bool CanvasRenderingContext2DBase::canDrawTextWithParams(float x, float y, bool fill, Optional<float> maxWidth)
2:  {
3:      auto* c = drawingContext();
4:      if (!c)
5:          return false;
6:      if (!this->fontProxy()->realized())
7:          return false;
8:      if (!state().hasInvertibleTransform)
9:          return false;
10:      if (!std::isfinite(x) | !std::isfinite(y))
11:          return false;
12:      if (maxWidth && (!std::isfinite(maxWidth.value()) || maxWidth.value() <= 0))
13:          return false;
14:
15:      // If gradient size is zero, nothing would be painted.
16:      auto gradient = c->strokeGradient();
17:      if (!fill && gradient && gradient->isZeroSize())
18:          return false;
19:
20:      gradient = c->fillGradient();
21:      if (fill && gradient && gradient->isZeroSize())
22:          return false;
23:
24:      return true;
25:  }
26:

```

At line 3 an `HTMLCanvasElement` object is retrieved with `WebCore::CanvasBase` and `m_size` that has default values of `m_width` as `300` and `m_height` as `150`. Then the execution of line 6 proceeds to:

```
1:  auto CanvasRenderingContext2D::fontProxy() -> const FontProxy* {
2:      auto& canvas = downcast<HTMLCanvasElement>(canvasBase());
3:      canvas.document().updateStyleIfNeeded();
4:      if (!state().font.realized())
5:          setFont(state().unparsedFont);
6:      return &state().font;
7:  }

```

At line 2, a `HTMLCanvasElement` object is checked for any changes made in the background and the new `m_height` is set to value `87` according to the execution of `event_change_height`. At this point, the previous allocation is made with old height value ( `old_m_height` of 150 minus `m_height` of 87 equals `63`). Afterwards, at line 20, a call to `fillGradient()` tries to read memory from old memory ranges which are now freed due to changes made when function `canvas.document().updateStyleIfNeeded();` was executed. This constitutes a use after free condition.

With proper memory layout control and heap grooming, an attacker would be able to take control of the erroneous memory reuse which could lead to information leak and possibly further memory corruption.
