# Out-of-bounds write in RPL-Classic and RPL-Lite

Moderate

[joakimeriksson](/joakimeriksson)
published
GHSA-mvc7-9p4q-c5cm
Jun 18, 2021

## Package

rpl-ext-header.c

## Affected versions

< 4.6

## Patched versions

4.6

## Description

### Impact

The RPL-Classic and RPL-Lite implementations in the Contiki-NG operating system do not validate the address pointer in the RPL source routing header This makes it possible for an attacker to cause out-of-bounds writes with packets injected into the network stack.

Specifically, the problem lies in the rpl\_ext\_header\_srh\_update function in the two rpl-ext-header.c modules for RPL-Classic and RPL-Lite respectively. The addr\_ptr variable is calculated using an unvalidated CMPR field value from the source routing header. An out-of-bounds write can be triggered on line 151 in os/net/routing/rpl-lite/rpl-ext-header.c and line 261 in os/net/routing/rpl-classic/rpl-ext-header.c, which contain the following memcpy call with addr\_ptr as destination.

memcpy(addr\_ptr, ((uint8\_t \*)&current\_dest\_addr) + cmpr, 16 - cmpr);

### Patches

The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG 4.6.

### Workarounds

Users can apply the patch in [Contiki-NG PR #1431](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1431).

### @nvt **[nvt](/nvt)** commented [Nov 4, 2020](#issue-736313843)

It is possible that the line `memcpy(addr_ptr, ((uint8_t *)&current_dest_addr) + cmpr, 16 - cmpr);` causes a write outside the uip buffer because addr\_ptr is not validated. This PR contains such a check and a test packet to demonstrate the behavior that can lead to a segmentation fault.

Sorry, something went wrong.
