- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  An error in Foxit Reader's implementation of the `removeField` method in its JavaScript engine. Specifically, when `removeField` is called with an empty string, it removes all fields instead of none, leading to a use-after-free condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free vulnerability (CWE-416) in the JavaScript engine when handling the `removeField` method.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: 
    -  Opening a specially crafted PDF document.
    - Visiting a specially crafted malicious site with the browser plugin extension enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to trick the user into opening a malicious PDF or visiting a malicious site.
