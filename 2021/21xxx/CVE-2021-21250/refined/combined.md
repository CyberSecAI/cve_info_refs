# Post-Auth External Entity Expansion (XXE)

Moderate

[robinshine](/robinshine)
published
GHSA-9pph-8gfc-6w2r
Jan 11, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<4.0.2

## Patched versions

4.0.3

## Description

### Impact

When BuildSpec is provided in XML format, the spec is processed by [`XmlBuildSpecMigrator.migrate(buildSpecString);`](https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/blob/main/server-core/src/main/java/io/onedev/server/migration/XmlBuildSpecMigrator.java) which processes the XML document without preventing

the expansion of external entities. These entities can be configured to read arbitrary files from the file system and dump their contents in the final XML document to be migrated. If the files are dumped in properties included in the YAML file, it will be possible for an attacker to read them. Eg:

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE data [
<!ENTITY file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
<data>&file;</data>
```

If not, it is possible for an attacker to exfiltrate the contents of these files Out Of Band.

This issue may lead to `arbitrary file read`

### Patches

This issue was addressed in 4.0.3 by ignoring ENTITY instructions in xml file

### Credits

This issue was discovered by [@pwntester](https://github.com/pwntester)

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-21250

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
