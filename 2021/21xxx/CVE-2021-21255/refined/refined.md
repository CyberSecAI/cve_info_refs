Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) issue. Specifically, it was possible for a logged-in user to switch between different entities by manipulating the entity identifier in requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **IDOR:** The application did not properly validate user authorization when accessing or modifying resources related to different entities.
- **Missing entity restriction validation:** The application failed to enforce entity restrictions when processing requests for dropdown menus, allowing users to potentially access data or perform actions within entities they weren't authorized for.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could gain access to resources and potentially modify data related to entities they are not supposed to have access to. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized actions, and potentially compromise the integrity of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By manipulating parameters, specifically 'entity_restrict', in requests related to dropdown menus, a logged-in user could switch between different entities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the application.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the application's request structure, particularly how entity identifiers are passed.
- No special privileges are needed to exploit the IDOR vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by introducing a mechanism to validate the entity restriction using an IDOR token in several files:
    - `ajax/dropdownTrackingDeviceType.php`
    - `inc/computer_item.class.php`
    - `inc/dropdown.class.php`
    - `inc/user.class.php`
- The fix also includes changes in the test suite `tests/functionnal/Dropdown.php` and `tests/functionnal/Session.php` to include entity restriction in IDOR tokens.
- The fix uses the `Session::getNewIDORToken()` function to generate tokens that are used to validate requests.
- The `Dropdown::getDropdownValue()` and `Dropdown::getDropdownConnect()` functions are also modified to use the IDOR token for validation.
- The fix introduces a new way to generate IDOR tokens that includes the `entity_restrict` parameter, ensuring that the user can only access the data they are authorized for.
