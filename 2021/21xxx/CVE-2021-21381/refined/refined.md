Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-21381:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Flatpak handles the `Exec` field in `.desktop` files, specifically how it processes special tokens related to file forwarding (`%F`, `%f`, `%U`, `%u`). Flatpak uses `@@` and `@@u` to encapsulate file arguments, which are then passed to the sandboxed application. However, it did not properly validate additional arguments, allowing an attacker to insert arbitrary file paths within these special tokens.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Insufficient Input Validation:** Flatpak failed to validate additional arguments in the `Exec` field, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary file paths encapsulated within `@@` tokens.
-   **File Forwarding Bypass:** The vulnerability abuses the intended "file forwarding" feature of Flatpak, which is meant to give sandboxed applications access to files a user has explicitly opened with it, but the vulnerability makes this access available to files not intended by the user.
-   **Sandbox Escape:** By exploiting this flaw, an attacker can cause the Flatpak application to gain access to files outside of its sandbox.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker can craft a malicious `.desktop` file that forces a Flatpak application to read arbitrary files from the host system (as seen in the PoC with `/etc/passwd`).
-   **Privilege Escalation**: While not a direct privilege escalation to root, an attacker can use this to obtain sensitive information, bypass file access restrictions, potentially leading to further compromise of user data or the system through other vulnerabilities.
-   **Malicious Application:** This vulnerability allows malicious app publishers to create apps that read user-accessible files outside of the sandbox.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious `.desktop` File:** The primary attack vector is via a specially crafted `.desktop` file. This file is installed when a Flatpak application is installed.
-   **Unprivileged User:** The attacker does not need elevated privileges to exploit this vulnerability. It can be exploited by any user who can install a malicious application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Publish Flatpak Applications:** An attacker needs to be able to publish a malicious Flatpak application that includes a crafted `.desktop` file that contains the malicious payload.
-   **User Installation:** A user must install the malicious Flatpak application.

**Mitigation:**

-   **Input Sanitization:**  The vulnerability was addressed by disallowing `@@` and `@@u` tokens in the desktop file. Additionally, the entire `@@` prefix was reserved to avoid similar issues in the future. Finally, Flatpak will refuse to export any `.desktop` files containing these tokens, which will prevent the installation of malicious applications.
-   **Upgrade:** Updating Flatpak to version 1.10.2 or later, or a backported version containing the patch will mitigate the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was assigned the CVE ID CVE-2021-21381.
- It was also assigned the Github Security Advisory GHSA-xgh4-387p-hqpp.
- Fixes were made to flatpak versions 1.10.2 and also backported to 1.8.x.
- Several downstream distributions like Debian and Fedora issued security advisories and updates for this issue.
