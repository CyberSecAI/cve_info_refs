Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21277:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way `angular-expressions` package handles user-controlled input when compiling expressions using the `expressions.compile()` method. Specifically, the lack of proper input sanitization allowed an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code via the `userControlledInput`, which could then be executed. This was achieved through a `constructor.constructor` technique that bypassed previous security measures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The core vulnerability is that arbitrary JavaScript code could be executed by the `expressions.compile()` method with user-provided input.
*   **Bypass of Previous Security Measures:** Previous security attempts to prevent access to sensitive properties were bypassed using the `.constructor.constructor` method, which is part of the prototype chain.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `angular-expressions` library did not adequately sanitize user-controlled input before compiling and executing the expressions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Browser Context:** If `angular-expressions` was used within a browser environment, the attacker could execute arbitrary browser-based scripts, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) or other client-side attacks.
*   **Server Context:** If the library was used in a server-side context, the attacker could achieve remote code execution on the server, allowing for significant compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-Controlled Input:** The attack vector is the ability to pass attacker-controlled input to the `expressions.compile()` function, which would then process and execute the malicious code within the context of the application using `angular-expressions`.
*   **`.constructor.constructor` technique:** The specific method used to inject malicious code involves leveraging the `.constructor.constructor` property to access the Function constructor and execute arbitrary code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to inject input:** The attacker needs the ability to supply or manipulate the input that is processed by `expressions.compile()`. This could be through a variety of means, depending on the application, including directly entering data into a field, modifying a query parameter, or intercepting and modifying data being sent to the server.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerability:** The attacker would need an understanding of how to exploit the vulnerability through the `constructor.constructor` technique.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was patched in version 1.1.2 of the `angular-expressions` library. The patch includes a change to how the library handles property access to prevent access to the prototype chain by using `hasOwnProperty` defensively. The provided content also suggests workarounds, such as disabling user input to `angular-expressions`, or allowing only a specific set of characters, though these are not ideal permanent solutions.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions a blog post about the removal of Angular's expression sandbox, indicating that this is a known issue related to the library's reliance on Angular's expression parsing capabilities.
*   The provided diffs show changes to `lib/parse.js` and `test/main.test.js`. These changes add a check using `hasOwnProperty` to prevent the bypass of the sandbox and add tests to check for the vulnerability.
