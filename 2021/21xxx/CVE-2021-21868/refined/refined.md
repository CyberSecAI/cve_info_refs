Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21868:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the unsafe deserialization of untrusted data within the `GetMissingTypesFromAuxStream` method of the `ObjectStream` class in CODESYS Development System. This method uses `BinaryFormatter.Deserialize`, which is known to be unsafe with untrusted input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsafe Deserialization (CWE-502):** The core issue is the use of `BinaryFormatter.Deserialize` on data from auxiliary files (`missingtypeinformation.auxiliary`) without proper verification or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary command execution on the system running the vulnerable CODESYS software.
- **Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure:** The advisory also mentions the potential for DoS and information disclosure, which are typical consequences of unsafe deserialization.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Project Files:** An attacker can embed malicious serialized data within a CODESYS project file (specifically in the `missingtypeinformation.auxiliary` file). When a user opens this malicious project, the vulnerable deserialization code is triggered.
- **Malicious Packages:** Installing malicious packages via the CODESYS package manager can also modify affected files.
- **Malicious SVN Repositories:** For CODESYS SVN, accessing a repository containing malicious project artifacts can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Skill Level:** The vulnerability is considered easily exploitable by an attacker with low technical skills.
- **Local User Interaction:** Exploitation requires a local user to open a malicious CODESYS project, archive, or access a malicious SVN repository.
- **Modification of Local Files:** An attacker can also modify local CODESYS configuration and profile files.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects CODESYS Development System V3, CODESYS Installer, and CODESYS SVN.
- The specific vulnerable function is `ObjectManager.plugin Project.get_MissingTypes()`.
- Publicly available Proof-of-Concept (POC) exploits exist.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.0 base score of 8.8 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
- The issue was discovered and reported by Patrick DeSantis of Cisco Talos.
- Affected versions include:
    - CODESYS Development System prior to V3.5.17.10
    - CODESYS Installer prior to V1.3.0
    - CODESYS SVN prior to V4.4.0.0
- CODESYS has released updates to fix the vulnerabilities.
