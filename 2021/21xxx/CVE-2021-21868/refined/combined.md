2.4  Severity Rating

CODESYS GmbH has rated this vulnerability as high.

The CVSS v3.0 base score of 8.8 has been assigned. The CVSS vector string is

3  Vulnerability details

3.1  Detailed Description

The CODESYS Development System is an IEC 61131-3 programming tool for the industrial controller
and automation technology sector. The CODESYS Installer manages the local installation of different
CODESYS Development System V3 versions and supports their deployment and update. CODESYS
SVN is an add-on providing an SVN version control client integrated into the CODESYS Development
system. All three products are affected by several vulnerabilities:

4/7

Advisory 2021-13

CVE-2021-21863:
CODESYS Development System V3 versions prior V3.5.17.10 and CODESYS Installer versions prior
V1.3.0 deserialize local profile files without sufficiently verifying the data.

CVE-2021-21864:
CODESYS Development System V3 versions prior V3.5.17.10 deserialize local configuration files
without sufficiently verifying the data.

CVE-2021-21865, CVE-2021-21866, CVE-2021-21867, CVE-2021-21868, CVE-2021-21869:
CODESYS Development System V3 versions prior to version V3.5.17.10 deserialize various parts of
CODESYS project and CODESYS repository files without sufficiently verifying the data. CODESYS
SVN versions prior to version V4.4.0.0 deserialize CODESYS project artifacts received from SVN
repositories without sufficiently verifying the data.

An attacker who successfully leverages these vulnerabilities can cause a denial of service (DoS),
information disclosure, or remote code execution in affected CODESYS products. To exploit these
vulnerabilities, an attacker must either modify local configuration and profile files of the CODESYS
installation or make the local user to open a malicious CODESYS project or archive. Installing
malicious packages utilizing the CODESYS package manager can also modify or add affected files. In
the case of CODESYS SVN, accessing an SVN repository that contains malicious CODESYS project
artifacts (storage profile) can trigger an attack when parsing the objects.

3.2  Exploitability

The vulnerabilities could be exploited by modifying the CODESYS installation or with the help of local
users.

3.3  Difficulty

An attacker with low skills would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.

3.4  Existence of exploit

POCs are publicly available.

4  Available software updates

CODESYS GmbH has released the following versions of the concerned CODESYS products to solve
the noted vulnerability issues:
• CODESYS Development System V3.5.17.10
• CODESYS Installer V1.3.0
• CODESYS SVN V4.4.0.0

All CODESYS Development System V3 versions prior to V3.5.17.10 should be replaced by version
V3.5.18.20 to ensure the fix for the CODESYS Development System and also for the CODESYS
Installer is maintained.

For CODESYS Development System V3 versions from V3.5.17.10 and before V3.5.18.20, it is
sufficient for the fix to run the CODESYS Installer in order to update it to V1.3.0 and keep the
CODESYS Development System version(s).

5/7

Advisory 2021-13

After the update of the CODESYS Development System V3 and/or CODESYS installer, version
V4.4.0.0 of CODESYS SVN can be downloaded and installed directly with the CODESYS Installer.

The CODESYS Development System V3 can be downloaded and installed directly with the
CODESYS Installer or downloaded from the CODESYS Store. The CODESYS Installer checks for
available updates at every startup and provides an update feature to update itself automatically.

Alternatively, you will find further information on obtaining the software update in the CODESYS
Update area [3].

5  Mitigation

CODESYS GmbH recommends using the available software updates to fix the vulnerabilities.

CODESYS GmbH has currently found no workaround for these vulnerabilities. Therefore, you should
protect your CODESYS installation from unknown access and only open/install CODESYS archives,
projects and packages from trustworthy sources, in case the software update is not applied.

CODESYS SVN users should avoid connecting to unknown / untrusted SVN servers, or servers with
untrusted users, in order to prevent loading of malicious CODESYS project artifacts.

Note: As of version V3.5.17.0, the CODESYS package manager checks the signature of the
packages before installation. Since then, CODESYS GmbH has only provided signed packages.

As part of a security strategy, CODESYS GmbH recommends the following general defense
measures to reduce the risk of exploits:

• Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and
ensure that they are not accessible from outside

• Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks
• Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required

• Activate and apply user management and password features
• Use encrypted communication links
• Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system
features, etc.

• Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions
For more information and general recommendations for protecting machines and plants, see also the
CODESYS Security Whitepaper [1].

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2021-1305

## CODESYS Development System ObjectManager.plugin Project.get\_MissingTypes() Unsafe Deserialization vulnerability

##### July 26, 2021

##### CVE Number

CVE-2021-21868

### Summary

An unsafe deserialization vulnerability exists in the ObjectManager.plugin Project.get\_MissingTypes() functionality of CODESYS GmbH CODESYS Development System 3.5.16 and 3.5.17. A specially crafted file can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

CODESYS GmbH CODESYS Development System 3.5.16

CODESYS GmbH CODESYS Development System 3.5.17

### Product URLs

<https://store.codesys.com/codesys.html>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-502 - Deserialization of Untrusted Data

### Details

The CODESYS Development System is the IEC 61131-3 programming tool for industrial control and automation technology, available in 32- and a 64-bit versions.

Unsafe deserialization occurs within GetMissingTypesFromAuxStream() on the ObjectStream class.

```
private IList<T> GetMissingTypesFromAuxStream<T>(string stAuxilaryName)
{
    ChunkedMemoryStream chunkedMemoryStream = new ChunkedMemoryStream();
    APEnvironment.ObjectMgr.GetAuxiliaryFileEntry(this._nProjectHandle, stAuxilaryName, chunkedMemoryStream);
    chunkedMemoryStream.Position = 0L;
    return (IList<T>)((IFormatter)new BinaryFormatter()).Deserialize(chunkedMemoryStream);  // [1]
}

```

The `BinaryFormatter.Deserialize` method is never safe when used with untrusted input [2]. The deserialization that occurs at [1] is vulnerable to exploitation via the missingtypeinformation.auxiliary file within a project.
