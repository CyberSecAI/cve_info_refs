Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-21465:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation and output sanitization within the `RSDL_DB_GET_DATA_BWS` function module. Specifically, parameters used to construct conditional SQL statements are not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Native SQL Injection (ADBC):** The primary vulnerability is a native SQL injection flaw. Attackers can inject malicious SQL commands through specific import parameters that get executed directly at the database level.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. This leads to the potential for full system compromise, which includes unauthorized access to sensitive data, manipulation of data, and other malicious activities at the database level.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Function Call (RFC):** The vulnerability can be exploited by invoking the vulnerable function module remotely via the RFC protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to establish an RFC connection to the vulnerable SAP system.
- **Knowledge of Function Module:** The attacker needs to know the name of the vulnerable function module `RSDL_DB_GET_DATA_BWS` and how to call it with the required parameters.
- **Ability to Craft SQL Injection Payloads:** The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious SQL commands within the import parameters.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable function uses the ABAP Database Connectivity (ADBC) framework, a native SQL interface, to execute the injected SQL commands.
- The attacker manipulates import parameters `I_S_TABSEL`, `I_S_DBCON`, `I_T_DBFIELDS`, and `I_T_SELECT` to inject SQL.
- Example SQL injection payload is shown in the document to demonstrate how to update the `USREFUS` table to escalate privileges to a user called `ATTACKER` by setting the reference user to `DDIC`.
