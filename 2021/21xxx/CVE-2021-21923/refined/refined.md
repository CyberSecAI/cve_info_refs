The provided content details multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the Advantech R-SeeNet application, including CVE-2021-21923.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the misuse of prepared statements within stored procedures. Specifically, the application constructs SQL queries by concatenating user-controlled input with SQL code. Although some sanitization is attempted via `mysqli_real_escape_string`, this protection is lost when the constructed query is passed to a stored procedure, where the final SQL statement is executed without specific parameter bindings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability in the `user_list` page due to insufficient sanitization of the `company_filter` parameter. The `company_filter` parameter is directly incorporated into the SQL query passed to the stored procedure `sp_GetUsersAll`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
  - Data exfiltration from the database.
  - Data manipulation or deletion.
  - Possible privilege escalation, depending on the database setup and the application's access level.
  - Denial of service through database overload.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests to the `/r-seenet/index.php` endpoint with a crafted `company_filter` parameter value, specifically when the `page` parameter is set to `user_list`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be authenticated, either through a valid administrative account or by using cross-site request forgery.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameter to craft the malicious request.

**Specific details for CVE-2021-21923:**

- The vulnerable parameter is `company_filter` and the injected payload is inserted into the following SQL statement:
  ```sql
  AND company_id = "'.mysqli_real_escape_string($link,$_SESSION['company_filter']).'"
  ```

- Example exploit:
```
GET /r-seenet/index.php?page=user_list&username_filter=a&name_filter=a&surname_filter=a&company_filter=a%22%20AND%20(SELECT%209766%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))a)--%20a HTTP/1.1
```
