- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds write in the `memcpy` function due to a buffer overflow caused by a missing size check. The vulnerability is located in the `GetCopyBufferAllocatedWithPixpos` function, where the calculated address can go beyond the allocated buffer because there is no check against the address computed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Out-of-bounds write
    - Buffer overflow
    - Missing size check
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory corruption leading to potential code execution or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted malformed TIF file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious TIF file to the vulnerable application. The attacker needs to control the `raster_size`, the size of the `copy_buffer_allocated` buffer, and the `pixpos` values from the file in order to trigger the out-of-bounds write vulnerability. Specifically, two TIF tags must be present in the file: a `bits_per_sample` tag (with a null value) and a `T4options` tag.
