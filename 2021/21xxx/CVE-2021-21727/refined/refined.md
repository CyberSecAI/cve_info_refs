- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A DoS vulnerability exists due to the processing of crafted IPv6 packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The device is vulnerable to a traffic amplification attack using carefully constructed IPv6 packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker sends specially crafted IPv6 packets to the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable device. No authentication is required.
