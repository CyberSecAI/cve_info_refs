Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21708:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2021-21708. The bug report on bugs.php.net explicitly mentions the CVE ID and describes a use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability in the `php_filter_float()` function, which is the core of this CVE. The patch provided in the github gist is also directly related to fixing this issue in the PHP source code.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `php_filter_float()` function within the PHP filter extension. The function attempts to filter numeric strings into float values, but when it encounters an integer, it performs `zval_ptr_dtor(value)` to free memory associated with an old zval, *before* determining if it will use the current value. In case the value does not need to be changed into a double, this results in a use-after-free condition since the function does not need to change the zval, but the zval has already been freed.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The primary vulnerability is a UAF condition. The zval's memory is deallocated prematurely when an integer is processed, leading to a use-after-free if the value does not need to be changed into a float.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact, as described in the bug report, is a segmentation fault (sigsegv) and a crash of the php-fpm process, leading to a denial of service for affected applications.
   - **Potential for other impacts:** While the primary observed impact is a crash, use-after-free vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited for other malicious purposes like arbitrary code execution or information disclosure, depending on the context and how the freed memory is reallocated.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   -  An attacker can craft a malicious input string that is interpreted as an integer by `is_numeric_string` and passed to `filter_var` with `FILTER_VALIDATE_FLOAT` causing the crash.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Ability to submit user input:** An attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted input string to a PHP application that uses `filter_var` with `FILTER_VALIDATE_FLOAT` and a range check. This implies that a web server that uses PHP with user provided input is vulnerable.
   - **No special privileges or prior authentication is needed.**

**Technical Details from Content:**
   - The code patch modifies the `ext/filter/logical_filters.c` to move the `zval_ptr_dtor(value)` after the check for whether the new zval needs to be allocated. This prevents the zval being freed when no new zval is assigned.
   - The `ext/filter/tests/bug81708.phpt` test file provides a demonstration of the vulnerability and also verifies that the fix addresses it.
