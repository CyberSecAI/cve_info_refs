- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-based buffer overflow in the `read_icc_icCurve_data` function due to an integer overflow when calculating the buffer size.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow leading to a heap buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause an out-of-bounds write by providing a crafted PSD file, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**:  A specially crafted PSD file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious PSD file to trigger the vulnerability. No special privileges are needed.
