Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-21370

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way TYPO3 CMS handles content elements of the 'menu' type when previewing referenced items in the page module. Specifically, the issue occurs in the Content Preview Renderer within the backend component of TYPO3.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS, meaning malicious scripts can be injected into the preview page due to insufficient sanitization of the referenced menu items.
- Improper Input Handling: The system fails to adequately sanitize user-provided input (specifically the referenced items of the menu content elements) before rendering it in the content preview, thus opening the door for XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Malicious Script Execution: Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
- Data Theft and Manipulation: Attackers could potentially steal sensitive information (e.g., session cookies), perform actions on behalf of the user (if logged in), or manipulate displayed content.
- Unauthorized Access/Actions: If the victim is an administrator or has elevated privileges in TYPO3, an attacker might be able to gain unauthorized access to sensitive functions or perform privileged actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Content Element Manipulation: An attacker crafts or modifies menu content elements with malicious code in the referenced items.
- Preview Functionality: This malicious content is then triggered when a user previews the page containing the manipulated menu within TYPO3's backend page module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- TYPO3 Backend Access: Attackers need a valid backend user account with the ability to create or edit content elements.
- Knowledge of TYPO3 Configuration: Attackers need to know the structure of the `menu` content element and how it's referenced.
- User Interaction: The vulnerability requires the victim (another backend user) to actively preview the malicious content in the page module.

**More Details Than CVE Description:**
- Specific Component: The vulnerability is specifically within the Content Preview Renderer (ext:backend)
- Specific Content Type: The vulnerability affects only content elements of type 'menu'
- Requires specific extensions: "The affected code is only executed if an extension is used that actually leverages the type menu. By default this is not available by the Core."
