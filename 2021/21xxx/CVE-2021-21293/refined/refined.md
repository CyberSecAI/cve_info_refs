{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `blaze-core` library accepts connections without limit on its selector pool. This allows an unbounded queue to grow, consuming OS resources (socket handles) and potentially degrading service performance.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unbounded connection acceptance leading to resource exhaustion."
    ],
    "impact": "Amplified degradation in services that are unable to handle their current request load; Each connection allocates a socket handle, which drains a scarce OS resource; Higher-level circuit breakers can be confounded due to failed connections.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Network-based attacks involving opening numerous connections to the server."
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to open connections to the vulnerable server. No specific position or capabilities are mentioned beyond network access."
  },
  "affected_versions": [
    "<= 0.14.14 (blaze-core)",
    "< 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M1, 1.0.0-M1 to 1.0.0-M13 (http4s-blaze-server)"
  ],
  "patched_versions": [
    "0.14.15 (blaze-core)",
    "0.21.18, 0.22.0-M3, 1.0.0-M16 (http4s-blaze-server)"
  ],
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is primarily found in `blaze-core` but also affects `http4s-blaze-server` which uses the library; A `maxConnections` property was added to `BlazeServerBuilder` to limit open connections; The NIO2 backend is deprecated and does not respect maxConnections; The `maxConnections` parameter was passed incorrectly in some versions, making it impossible to change the default of 512."
