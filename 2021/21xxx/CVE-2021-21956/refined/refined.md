The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21956.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the insecure use of the `unserialize()` function in the `deobfuscateDecodedFileGetContentsWithFunc` function within the Ai-Bolit component of Imunify360. Specifically, the function takes data extracted from a scanned file (via regex), decodes it with `base64_decode`, and directly passes it to `unserialize()` without any prior sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Deserialization of untrusted data: The core weakness is the lack of input validation before unserializing data, making the system vulnerable to object injection attacks.
- Improper handling of regex matches: The code extracts data from regex matches without checking its validity or whether it is expected format before passing it to `unserialize()`.
- Usage of `base64_decode` on untrusted data before passing it to `unserialize()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected server. By providing a specially crafted serialized PHP object, an attacker can trigger the execution of arbitrary code through the magic method of a class, such as `__destruct()`.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a specially crafted file that contains a malicious, obfuscated code pattern matching a specific regex that the scanner processes. The attacker must be able to upload or otherwise introduce such a file to the system such that the vulnerable `ai-bolit-hoster.php` script will process it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to introduce malicious file into the system that will be scanned by Ai-Bolit.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious file with a specific format to match a regex, to trigger the vulnerable `deobfuscateDecodedFileGetContentsWithFunc` function.
- The vulnerable service runs with root privileges. This elevates the impact.
