Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21694:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `FilePath` class within Jenkins. Specifically, several methods (`toURI`, `hasSymlink`, `absolutize`, `isDescendant`, and `get*DiskSpace`) do not perform any permission checks before execution. This allows an agent to execute these methods without any restrictions, potentially leaking information about the controller.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Permission Checks:** The primary weakness is the absence of permission checks in the specified `FilePath` methods. These methods can be used to gather information about the controller's file system, such as whether a symlink exists, the absolute path of a file, or disk space information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with control over an agent process can use these methods to gather information about the Jenkins controller's file system. This information could include the file paths and disk space usage. This information could then be used to further compromise the Jenkins controller.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Agent-to-Controller Communication:** The attack vector involves an agent process communicating with the Jenkins controller and invoking the vulnerable `FilePath` methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Compromised Agent:** The attacker needs to have control over a Jenkins agent process. This could be achieved by compromising a node or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the agent setup.
