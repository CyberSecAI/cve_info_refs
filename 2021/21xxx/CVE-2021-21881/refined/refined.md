- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `ssid` parameter in the `WLANScanSSID` AJAX endpoint is not sanitized before being used in a `system` call to `/usr/sbin/wpa_cli`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS command injection (CWE-78) due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges on the device.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/` endpoint with the `ajax=WLANScanSSID` parameter, including a malicious payload in the `ssid` field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be authenticated to the web manager of the Lantronix PremierWave 2050 device to send the malicious request.
