Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-21864:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Unsafe deserialization of untrusted data using `BinaryFormatter.Deserialize()` in the `ComponentManager.StartupCultureSettings` functionality of CODESYS Development System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The application deserializes data from a file without proper validation, specifically using the `BinaryFormatter.Deserialize()` method which is known to be unsafe when used with untrusted input.
- **Reliance on File Existence:** The application checks for the existence of a file named `APStartupCulture` (without extension) in specific directories (`C:\Users<user>\AppData\Roaming\` or `C:\ProgramData\`) and treats it as a "legacy" file to be deserialized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can craft a malicious `APStartupCulture` file that, when deserialized, can lead to arbitrary command execution.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The vulnerability can also be exploited to cause a denial of service in the affected CODESYS products.
- **Information Disclosure:**  The vulnerability could potentially lead to information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File:** An attacker can provide a specially crafted file named `APStartupCulture` to the user's file system at the specified locations.
- **Compromised Packages:** Installing malicious packages using the CODESYS package manager can modify or add the affected files.
- **Malicious SVN Repository:** In the context of CODESYS SVN, accessing an SVN repository containing malicious CODESYS project artifacts can trigger the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local File System Access:** The attacker needs to be able to place the malicious `APStartupCulture` file in the user's `C:\Users<user>\AppData\Roaming\` or `C:\ProgramData\` directory, which usually requires some level of access to the target machine.
- **User Interaction:** The user would need to start the CODESYS Development System for the vulnerability to be triggered.
- **Low Skill Level:**  The advisory indicates that an attacker with low skills would be able to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability lies in the method `_3S.CoDeSys.Core.Components.ComponentManager.StartupCultureSettings.method13()`.
- The application checks for an `APStartupCulture` file (without extension) to trigger the vulnerability, avoiding a file named `APStartupCulture.xml`.
- The vulnerability can lead to a `SerializationException` if the malicious file is not properly crafted, but the underlying vulnerability (unsafe deserialization) can still be exploited.
- CODESYS has released updates to address this issue, urging users to update to at least version V3.5.17.10 or, ideally, to V3.5.18.20 to maintain the fix for both the development system and the installer.
