- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `FilePath` API implementation where permission to create temporary files is checked only after they are created.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Incorrect permission check timing. Specifically, when creating temporary files, the permission to create files is checked *after* the files have been created. This allows a malicious actor to create the files even if they do not have the permission initially.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers with control of agent processes can bypass the intended access controls and potentially write to arbitrary locations on the Jenkins controller filesystem by creating temporary files and then manipulating them before the permission check is performed. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or data corruption on the Jenkins controller.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the agent-to-controller communication mechanism, specifically using the `FilePath` API to create temporary files.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to control an agent process connected to the vulnerable Jenkins controller.
