Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21672:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Selenium HTML report plugin for Jenkins did not properly configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE Injection:** The plugin's XML parser was vulnerable to XXE attacks due to a lack of configuration to disable external entity resolution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could craft malicious XML report files to extract sensitive information (secrets) from the Jenkins controller.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Attackers could use the vulnerability to perform SSRF attacks, potentially accessing internal resources or services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious XML Report Files:** Attackers need to be able to control the report files that are parsed by the vulnerable Jenkins plugin. This typically involves uploading a crafted XML file to Jenkins through a compromised build process, or other methods that allow for modification of input files used by the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have the ability to control the content of XML report files that are parsed by the Selenium HTML report plugin.  This includes access to the Jenkins system via an authenticated user or other means that allow for the upload and parsing of a maliciously constructed XML file.
