Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-21304

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a prototype pollution issue in the `lib/utils/object/set.ts` utility method within the `dynamoose` library. This method was used to set values on objects, and it did not properly sanitize the input keys, allowing an attacker to modify the prototype of an object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is prototype pollution. By crafting a malicious key (e.g. `__proto__`), an attacker could inject properties into the prototype of `Object`, which would then affect all objects in the application.
- **Unsanitized Input:** The `set.ts` method did not validate or sanitize the input keys before setting values on the target object, making the prototype pollution possible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Application-Wide Impact:** Prototype pollution can lead to various security issues. Since the prototype of `Object` is modified, all objects in the application are affected by the malicious changes.
- **Denial of Service:** The attacker could potentially inject values that would break the application's logic or cause it to crash, leading to a denial-of-service.
- **Data Manipulation:** By polluting the prototype, attackers might be able to manipulate data in unexpected ways.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some circumstances, prototype pollution can be leveraged for arbitrary code execution, though this is less common.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulated Input:** An attacker could provide a specially crafted JSON object with keys like `__proto__` or `constructor` through an interface that utilizes the vulnerable `set` function. This would allow them to pollute the prototype.
- **Dynamoose usage:** This specific method is used throughout the codebase so any use of this library with attacker controlled data that is then passed into this method can trigger this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide input:** The attacker needs to have the ability to provide input that is then processed by the vulnerable `set` function of the `dynamoose` library.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in `dynamoose` versions 2.0.0 through 2.6.0.
- Version 2.7.0 includes a fix for the vulnerability.
- The fix involves checking the final key before setting the value, and avoiding setting the value if it is `__proto__` or `constructor`.
- The advisory notes that there is no evidence of this vulnerability being exploited, but the impact could be significant if exploited.
- This vulnerability does not affect v1.x.x of the library as the `set` method was introduced in the v2 rewrite.
