Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-21781

**Description:** An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the ARM SIGPAGE functionality of Linux Kernel. A userland application can read the contents of the sigpage, which can leak kernel memory contents.

**Root Cause:**
The Linux kernel allocates a page of memory for signal handling (sigpage) but does not zero it out after allocation. This sigpage is then mapped into every userland process' virtual memory space. Because the page is not cleared after allocation, it retains data left in kernel memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Use of Uninitialized Resource:** The kernel allocates memory for the sigpage but does not initialize it, leading to the disclosure of previously stored data.
- **Information Disclosure:** Uninitialized memory within the sigpage is readable by userland processes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Memory Leakage:**  Attackers can potentially leak sensitive kernel data by reading the sigpage's contents. This may include data from previous boots or other processes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability via a userland application running on the targeted system.
- **Memory Read:** Attackers can read the `[sigpage]` memory region within their own process's address space.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  Attackers need the ability to execute code on the targeted system.
- No specific privileges are required.

**Additional Details:**
- The sigpage is initialized once during system startup (when the `init` binary is run), but it's mapped into the address space of every new process. This means the uninitialized content is exposed to all user-level applications.
- The leaked data includes the signal return handlers, and the uninitialized data is persistent until the device reboots.
- The vulnerability affects ARMv7 processors.

**Affected Versions:**
- Linux Kernel v5.4.54
- Linux Kernel v5.4.66
- The document also mentions that version 5.11-rc4 seems still vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability was patched, however, the exact patch is not specified in the document.
