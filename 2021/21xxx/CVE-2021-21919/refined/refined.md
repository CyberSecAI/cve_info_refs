Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21919:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the misuse of prepared statements in conjunction with stored procedures and SQL concatenation. Specifically, variables used to build SQL queries are initially sanitized but lose this protection when invoked against the database due to the final prepared statement being directly taken from a variable (`@sql`) without proper parameter binding. This allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper handling of user-controlled input within the SQL query construction. Specifically, the `ord` parameter is not correctly sanitized when used in a SQL query.
- Improper use of prepared statements: The code prepares the SQL statement using a variable that is built with concatenated strings, rather than using parameterized queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability can lead to:
- Arbitrary SQL query execution
- Potential data exfiltration
- Unauthorized access to sensitive information
- Modification of the database
- Denial of service using time-based blind SQL injection with `SLEEP()`

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests to the `/r-seenet/index.php?page=company_list` endpoint.
- The `ord` parameter in the query string is used as the injection point

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the application to trigger the vulnerability, specifically with a super-administrator account to achieve exploitation without needing CSRF.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker needs to craft malicious SQL payloads within the `ord` parameter.
- The application is accessible to the attacker.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `company_list.php` page.
- The `ord` parameter is taken from the HTTP GET request and stored in the session without sufficient validation, and then incorporated into the SQL query.
- The SQL query is built dynamically using string concatenation within the `sp_GetCompanies` stored procedure, which loses its protection of initially sanitized parameters.
- The `mysqli_real_escape_string` is applied to the `ord` parameter, but this is insufficient to prevent the SQL injection due to the vulnerable stored procedure.
- The attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands using techniques like time-based blind SQL injection using `SLEEP()`.

**CVE-2021-21919 Specific Details:**
- The 'ord' parameter is used in an `ORDER BY` clause within the SQL query, allowing the injection via this parameter.
- The provided example exploit shows how to inject a time-based blind SQL injection using `SLEEP()` function.
