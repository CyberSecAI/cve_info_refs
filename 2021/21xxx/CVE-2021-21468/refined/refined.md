{
  "cve": "CVE-2021-21468",
  "description": "The function module RSDL_DB_GET_DATA_BWS of function group RSDL in SAP Business Warehouse does not perform any programmatically implemented authorization check. An attacker can abuse this bug by invoking the function remotely via the RFC protocol. Successful exploitation allows to read out the entire database including cross-client data access.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Missing authorization check in function module RSDL_DB_GET_DATA_BWS.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing authorization check.",
      "Lack of input validation or sanitization."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read the entire database, including cross-client data, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information such as user master records or secure storages. Data exfiltration is possible.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerable function module can be invoked remotely via the RFC protocol.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to make RFC calls to the affected system. No explicit authorization is required due to the missing check.",
     "additional_info": "The vulnerability allows execution of native SQL queries at the database level, using the ABAP Database Connectivity (ADBC) framework, bypassing the standard authorization checks."
