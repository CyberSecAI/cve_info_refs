- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of XML deserialization errors in Jenkins REST API.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: When deserialization of XML data fails, Jenkins stores invalid object references in the Old Data Monitor. If an administrator discards the old data, some erroneous data might persist, leading to the instantiation of potentially unsafe objects.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers with specific permissions (View/Create, Job/Create, Agent/Create, or respective \*/Configure) can inject crafted content into the Old Data Monitor that, when discarded by an administrator, results in the instantiation of potentially unsafe objects.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers can use the XML REST APIs to configure views, jobs, and other items, submitting crafted XML data that causes deserialization to fail and creating invalid object references in Old Data Monitor.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers need to have View/Create, Job/Create, Agent/Create, or their respective \*/Configure permissions. They also require the administrator to discard the old data from the monitor.
