Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-21689:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `FilePath#unzip` and `FilePath#untar` methods of Jenkins, which were not subjected to any access control checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Lack of access control on `FilePath#unzip` and `FilePath#untar` operations. This allowed agents to perform these operations without any restrictions, potentially leading to unauthorized file access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker in control of an agent process could potentially read or write arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller by using the vulnerable `FilePath#unzip` and `FilePath#untar` operations. This could lead to complete compromise of the controller.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker who can control a Jenkins agent can send commands to the Jenkins controller to perform `unzip` or `untar` operations on arbitrary file paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have control over a Jenkins agent that is connected to the vulnerable Jenkins controller.

**Additional Details:**

*   This vulnerability is part of a group of vulnerabilities related to the agent-to-controller file access control mechanism.
*   The issue was present since the fix for SECURITY-144 in 2014.
*   The fix implemented in Jenkins versions 2.319 and LTS 2.303.3 introduces access control checks for `FilePath#unzip` and `FilePath#untar`.
