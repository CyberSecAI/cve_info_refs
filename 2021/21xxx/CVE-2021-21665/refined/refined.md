Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21665:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin (versions 10.0.1 and earlier) contains a form validation method that does not require POST requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The lack of POST request enforcement in the form validation method allows an attacker to induce a user's browser to make unauthorized requests to the Jenkins server. This occurs because a simple GET request can trigger the form validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Capture:** When combined with other vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-21663 and CVE-2021-21664) that allow an attacker to specify a URL and obtain credentials IDs, this CSRF vulnerability lets an attacker capture username/password credentials stored in Jenkins by forcing a request to an attacker controlled URL with the obtained credential ID.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker can craft a malicious link or HTML page that, when accessed by a logged-in Jenkins user, triggers the vulnerable form validation method in the XebiaLabs XL Deploy plugin through a GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the capability to induce a logged-in Jenkins user to access the malicious link/page (e.g., phishing, social engineering, cross-site scripting on the same domain, etc.)
*   The attacker needs to know how to exploit CVE-2021-21663 and CVE-2021-21664 in order to obtain credential IDs.
*   The attacker needs Overall/Read permissions, obtained either by legitimate access or by exploiting another vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is part of a set of vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-21663, CVE-2021-21664, and CVE-2021-21665) that relate to the same vulnerable form validation method in the XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin.
*   The fix in XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin 10.0.2 requires POST requests for the affected form validation method, addressing the CSRF vulnerability.
