| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2021-21568 | Dell EMC PowerScale OneFS versions 8.2.x - 9.2.x contain an insufficient logging vulnerability. An authenticated user with ISI\_PRIV\_LOGIN\_PAPI may make un-audited and un-trackable configuration changes to settings that their roles have privileges to change. | 4.3 | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L |
| CVE-2021-21592 | Dell EMC PowerScale OneFS versions 8.2.x - 9.2.x improperly handle an exceptional condition. A remote low privileged user may potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to unauthorized information disclosure. | 3.1 | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N |
| CVE-2021-21594 | Dell PowerScale OneFS versions 8.2.2 - 9.1.0.x contain a use of get request method with sensitive query strings vulnerability. It may lead to potential disclosure of sensitive data. Dell recommends upgrading at your earliest opportunity. | 8.2 | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H |
| CVE-2021-21595 | Dell EMC PowerScale OneFS versions 8.2.x - 9.1.1.x contain an improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. This vulnerability may allow the compadmin user to elevate privileges. This only impacts Smartlock WORM compliance mode clusters as a critical vulnerability and Dell recommends to update or upgrade at the earliest opportunity. | 6.0 | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H |
| CVE-2021-21599 | Dell EMC PowerScale OneFS versions 8.2.x - 9.2.1.x contain an OS command injection vulnerability. This may allow a user with ISI\_PRIV\_LOGIN\_SSH or ISI\_PRIV\_LOGIN\_CONSOLE to escalate privileges and escape the compliance guarantees. This only impacts Smartlock WORM compliance mode clusters as a critical vulnerability and Dell recommends to update or upgrade at the earliest opportunity. | 6.0 | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H |
| CVE-2021-36278 | Dell EMC PowerScale OneFS versions 8.2.x, 9.1.0.x, and 9.1.1.1 contain a sensitive information exposure vulnerability in log files. A local malicious user with ISI\_PRIV\_LOGIN\_SSH, ISI\_PRIV\_LOGIN\_CONSOLE, or ISI\_PRIV\_SYS\_SUPPORT privileges may exploit this vulnerability to access sensitive information. If any third-party consumes those logs, the same sensitive information is available to those systems as well. Dell recommends to update or upgrade at the earliest opportunity. | 8.1 | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H |
| CVE-2021-36279 | Dell EMC PowerScale OneFS versions 8.2.x - 9.2.x contain an incorrect permission assignment for critical resource vulnerability.

| CVE-2021-36281 | Dell EMC PowerScale OneFS versions 8.2.x - 9.2.x contain an incorrect permission assignment vulnerability. A low privileged authenticated user may potentially exploit this vulnerability to escalate privileges. | 7.5 | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H |
| CVE-2021-36282 | Dell EMC PowerScale OneFS versions 8.2.x - 9.1.0.x contain a use of uninitialized resource vulnerability. This may potentially allow an authenticated user with ISI\_PRIV\_LOGIN\_CONSOLE or ISI\_PRIV\_LOGIN\_SSH privileges to gain access up to 24 bytes of data within the /ifs kernel stack under certain conditions. | 2.5 | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N |
