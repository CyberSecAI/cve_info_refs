Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21707:

**1. Verification:**

The content is relevant to CVE-2021-21707. The CVE description mentions that certain PHP XML parsing functions URL-decode the filename passed to them and may cause them to interpret a URL-encoded NULL byte as the end of the filename. This behavior is discussed in several of the provided excerpts.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the way PHP's XML parsing functions (like `simplexml_load_file()`) handle filenames. These functions URL-decode the filename, and if a URL-encoded NUL byte (`%00`) is present, it's treated as the end-of-string marker, leading to incorrect file path interpretation. This is further elaborated in the php-src github commit: "The libxml based XML functions accepting a filename actually accept URIs with possibly percent-encoded characters. Percent-encoded NUL bytes lead to truncation, like non-encoded NUL bytes would. "

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Path Truncation:** The core weakness lies in the fact that URL-decoded NUL bytes cause premature termination of the filename string.
    *   **Improper Input Handling:** The vulnerable functions don't properly sanitize or validate the filename before passing it to the underlying XML parsing library.
    *   **Inconsistent Interpretation:** The functions interpret the filename differently than intended by the user, which can lead to the loading of a different file than expected.
    *   The tenable.com content notes, "In PHP versions 7.3.x below 7.3.33, 7.4.x below 7.4.26 and 8.0.x below 8.0.13, certain XML parsing functions, like simplexml_load_file(), URL-decode the filename passed to them. If that filename contains URL-encoded NUL character, this may cause the function to interpret this as the end of the filename, thus interpreting the filename differently from what the user intended, which may lead it to reading a different file than intended."

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** A malicious actor can potentially trick the application into loading a different file than intended. This can lead to sensitive information disclosure if the attacker is able to get the application to read a file they should not have access to.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network Request:** An attacker can pass a crafted URL containing a URL-encoded NUL byte to a vulnerable PHP application.
    *  The php-src commit comments shows that the issue stems from libxml's `xmlParseURI()` function where a  percent-encoded NULL byte would result in a truncated URI.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote, as the filename is passed through a network request.
    *   **Knowledge of vulnerable application**: The attacker must be able to send a request to a php application using a vulnerable version of php that calls the vulnerable functions.
    *   **Ability to inject/influence filename:** The attacker must be able to control or influence the filename passed to the vulnerable PHP functions.

**3. Additional Notes**
    - The github commit content shows that the vulnerability impacts ext/dom/domimplementation.c, ext/libxml/libxml.c, and ext/simplexml/tests files. 
    - The bug report from bugs.php.net clarifies that while `simplexml_load_file()` has a URL decoding behaviour the vulnerability occurs when a NULL byte is present.
    - The fix implemented in the php-src github commit uses `strstr(filename, "%00")` to explicitly check for the presence of a URL encoded null byte
    - The Tenable advisory for TNS-2022-09 groups CVE-2021-21707 with several other CVEs which were addressed in Tenable.sc 5.21.0.
    - NetApp also addressed this CVE in its advisory NTAP-20211223-0005
