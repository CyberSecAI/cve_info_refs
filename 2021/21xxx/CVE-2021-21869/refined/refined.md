Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-21869

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Unsafe deserialization of untrusted data using `BinaryFormatter.Deserialize` within the `ProfileData` property of the `ProfileInformation` class.
- The `BinaryFormatter.Deserialize` method is inherently unsafe when used with untrusted input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsafe Deserialization:** The application deserializes data from a byte array (`ProfileData`) using the `BinaryFormatter` without proper validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** By providing a specially crafted file containing malicious serialized data, an attacker can achieve arbitrary command execution on the system running the CODESYS Development System.
- **Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure, Remote Code Execution:**  As stated by the vendor, successful exploitation could lead to these impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Project File:** An attacker can craft a malicious CODESYS project file with a modified `profile.auxiliary` file containing malicious serialized data within the `ProfileData`.
- **Malicious Package:** Installing malicious packages via the CODESYS package manager can modify the affected profile files.
- **Malicious SVN repository artifacts:** In the case of CODESYS SVN, a malicious actor can provide malicious project artifacts through SVN repositories.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to modify the `profile.auxiliary` file within a CODESYS project, or modify local configuration files.
- **User Interaction:** An attacker would need a user to open a malicious CODESYS project or archive, or install a malicious package.
- In the case of CODESYS SVN, the attacker would need to have the user access a malicious SVN server.
- **Low Skill Level:** The vendor states that the vulnerabilities can be exploited with low skill levels.

**Affected Versions:**
- CODESYS Development System versions prior to V3.5.17.10 (Specifically tested on 3.5.16 and 3.5.17).
- CODESYS Installer versions prior to V1.3.0
- CODESYS SVN versions prior to V4.4.0.0

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to CODESYS Development System V3.5.17.10 or later.
- Upgrade to CODESYS Installer V1.3.0 or later.
- Upgrade to CODESYS SVN V4.4.0.0 or later
- Users are advised to avoid opening projects or archives from untrusted sources, and to protect CODESYS installations.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during project loading when the `ProfileData` property is deserialized using the unsafe `BinaryFormatter`.
- Publicly available Proof of Concepts (PoCs) exist.
- The vendor provides additional security recommendations, such as network segmentation and access control, to reduce the risk of exploitation.
