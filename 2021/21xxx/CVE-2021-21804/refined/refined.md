- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `options.php` script in Advantech R-SeeNet does not properly sanitize the `sub_opt` parameter, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files using the `include()` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-supplied input (`sub_opt` parameter) before using it in an `include()` function, allowing for arbitrary file inclusion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can exploit the LFI vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the server, potentially exposing sensitive information, such as database credentials, or even achieve arbitrary PHP code execution using PHP streams.
- **Attack vectors**: A crafted HTTP GET request to the `/index.php` file, specifying the `page=options` and a malicious value in the `sub_opt` parameter (e.g., `php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/config.inc`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Advantech R-SeeNet application. The vulnerability is accessible even to a `guest` user.
