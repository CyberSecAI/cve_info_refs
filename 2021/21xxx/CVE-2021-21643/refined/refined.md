Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21643:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Config File Provider Plugin versions 3.7.0 and earlier do not correctly perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate permission checks in HTTP endpoints. This allows unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with `Job/Configure` permission can enumerate system-scoped credential IDs.
- These enumerated IDs can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to capture the actual credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack via HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have `Job/Configure` permission in Jenkins. This indicates a user with some level of access to the Jenkins instance, but not necessarily administrative access.
