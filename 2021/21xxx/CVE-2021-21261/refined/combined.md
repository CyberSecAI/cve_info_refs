Debian Security Advisory DSA-4830-1                   security@debian.org

Package        : flatpak
CVE ID         : not yet available

Simon McVittie discovered a bug in the flatpak-portal service that can
allow sandboxed applications to execute arbitrary code on the host system
(a sandbox escape).

The Flatpak portal D-Bus service (flatpak-portal, also known by its
D-Bus service name org.freedesktop.portal.Flatpak) allows apps in a
Flatpak sandbox to launch their own subprocesses in a new sandbox
instance, either with the same security settings as the caller or
with more restrictive security settings. For example, this is used in
Flatpak-packaged web browsers such as Chromium to launch subprocesses
that will process untrusted web content, and give those subprocesses a
more restrictive sandbox than the browser itself.

In vulnerable versions, the Flatpak portal service passes caller-specified
environment variables to non-sandboxed processes on the host system,
and in particular to the flatpak run command that is used to launch the
new sandbox instance. A malicious or compromised Flatpak app could set
environment variables that are trusted by the flatpak run command, and
use them to execute arbitrary code that is not in a sandbox.

For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.5-0+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your flatpak packages.

For the detailed security status of flatpak please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/flatpak>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

```
If the caller specifies a variable that can be used to inject arbitrary
code into processes, we must not allow it to enter the environment
block used to run `flatpak run`, which runs unsandboxed.

This change requires the previous commit "context: Add --env-fd option",
which adds infrastructure used here.

To be secure, this change also requires the previous commit
"run: Convert all environment variables into bwrap arguments", which
protects a non-setuid bwrap(1) from the same attack.

This avoids some of them being filtered out by a setuid bwrap. It also
means that if they came from an untrusted source, they cannot be used
to inject arbitrary code into a non-setuid bwrap via mechanisms like
LD_PRELOAD.

Because they get bundled into a memfd or temporary file, they do not
actually appear in argv, ensuring that they remain inaccessible to
processes running under a different uid (which is important if their
values are tokens or other secrets).

This is a security update that fixes a sandbox escape where a

malicious application can execute code outside the sandbox

by controlling the environment of the "flatpak run" command

when spawning a sub-sandbox.

# Flatpak: Sandbox escape â€” GLSA **202101-21**

A vulnerability was discovered in Flatpak which could allow a
remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-apps/flatpak** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.10.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.10.0** |

### Background

Flatpak is a Linux application sandboxing and distribution framework.

### Description

A bug was discovered in the flatpak-portal service that can allow
sandboxed applications to execute arbitrary code on the host system (a
sandbox escape).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
Flatpak app possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

As a workaround, this vulnerability can be mitigated by preventing the
flatpak-portal service from starting, but that mitigation will prevent
many Flatpak apps from working correctly. It is highly recommended to
upgrade.

### Resolution

All Flatpak users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-apps/flatpak-1.10.0"

```

# CVE-2021-21261: Flatpak sandbox escape via spawn portal

High

[alexlarsson](/alexlarsson)
published
GHSA-4ppf-fxf6-vxg2
Jan 14, 2021

## Package

Flatpak
(freedesktop.org)

## Affected versions

>= 0.11.4 and < 1.10.0, except for 1.8.x >= 1.8.5

## Patched versions

All >= 1.10.0, 1.8.x >= 1.8.5

## Description

Simon McVittie discovered a bug in the `flatpak-portal` service that can allow sandboxed applications to execute arbitrary code on the host system (a sandbox escape).

The Flatpak portal D-Bus service (`flatpak-portal`, also known by its D-Bus service name `org.freedesktop.portal.Flatpak`) allows apps in a Flatpak sandbox to launch their own subprocesses in a new sandbox instance, either with the same security settings as the caller or with

more restrictive security settings. For example, this is used in Flatpak-packaged web browsers such as Chromium to launch subprocesses

that will process untrusted web content, and give those subprocesses a more restrictive sandbox than the browser itself.

In vulnerable versions, the Flatpak portal service passes caller-specified environment variables to non-sandboxed processes on the host system, and in particular to the `flatpak run` command that is used to launch the new sandbox instance. A malicious or compromised Flatpak app could set environment variables that are trusted by the `flatpak run` command, and use them to execute arbitrary code that is not in a sandbox.

## Workaround

This vulnerability can be mitigated by preventing the `flatpak-portal` service from starting, but that mitigation will prevent many Flatpak apps from working correctly.

## Fixes

This is fixed in Flatpak 1.10.0 and 1.8.5 (commits [6d1773d](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/6d1773d2a54dde9b099043f07a2094a4f1c2f486), [6e5ae7a](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/6e5ae7a109cdfa9735ea7ccbd8cb79f9e8d3ae8b), [aeb6a7a](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/aeb6a7ab0abaac4a8f4ad98b3df476d9de6b8bd4), [cc14010](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/cc1401043c075268ecc652eac557ef8076b5eaba), with automated test coverage added in

[8212498](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/821249844bbb7e52cbf4508b4de18c05e8592220), [39a5621](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/39a5621e6941b9d27bf89b63e8fb6cad6e279e53), [d19f6c3](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/d19f6c330aa42e17df6dc36d12b6f4dfa507dbb3)).

The initial fixes introduced a regression ([#4080](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/4080)) for users of a setuid version of bubblewrap (bwrap). This is fixed in 1.10.1 (commits [9a61d2c](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/9a61d2c44f0a58cebcb9b2787ae88db07ca68bb0) and [fb473ca](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/fb473cad801c6b61706353256cab32330557374a), also backported to the flatpak-1.8.x branch).

## Out of scope

The `flatpak-session-helper` service (`org.freedesktop.Flatpak`, as accessed by `flatpak-spawn --host`) is intended to give specially-flagged apps the ability to run arbitrary code on the host system, so it is not a vulnerability that it also trusts the environment variables it is given. Granting access to the `org.freedesktop.Flatpak` service indicates that an app is trusted and can legitimately execute arbitrary code outside the sandbox. For example, the GNOME Builder integrated development environment is flagged as trusted in this way.
