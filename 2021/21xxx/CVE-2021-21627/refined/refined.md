Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-21627:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Libvirt Agents Plugin does not enforce the use of POST requests for a specific form submission endpoint. This lack of enforcement leads to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability due to missing POST request enforcement for a form submission endpoint.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to stop hypervisor domains.

**Attack vectors:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). An attacker could craft a malicious web page that, when visited by an authenticated Jenkins user, would trigger a request to the vulnerable endpoint, causing a hypervisor domain to stop.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the Jenkins instance.
- Requires a logged-in victim to visit a malicious page/link controlled by the attacker

**Additional Details:**
- The affected plugin is `libvirt-slave` versions 1.9.0 and earlier.
- The fix is implemented in version 1.9.1 of the plugin, which enforces POST requests for the vulnerable endpoint.
