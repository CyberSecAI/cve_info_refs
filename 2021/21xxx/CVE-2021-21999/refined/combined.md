## VMware Workstation Tools Uncontrolled Search Path Element Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

### ZDI-21-754ZDI-CAN-13068

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-21999](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-21999) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [VMware](https://www.vmware.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Workstation |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of VMware Workstation. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the VGAuthService service. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied OpenSSL configuration file prior to using it. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | VMware has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
