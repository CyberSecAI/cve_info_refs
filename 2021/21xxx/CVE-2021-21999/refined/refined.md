Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-21999:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied OpenSSL configuration file by the `VGAuthService` service in VMware Workstation Tools, VMware Remote Console for Windows (VMRC), and VMware App Volumes. The service uses this configuration file without checking for malicious content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Uncontrolled Search Path Element:** The service loads an OpenSSL configuration file from a user-controlled location.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The service does not validate the contents of the configuration file before using it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit allows a local attacker to escalate their privileges to `SYSTEM` level, leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of the SYSTEM user.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** With SYSTEM privileges, an attacker can execute any malicious code, potentially leading to complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target system with low-privilege access.
*   **Malicious Configuration File:** The attacker places a malicious OpenSSL configuration file, named `openssl.cnf`, in a location where the vulnerable service will load it from an unrestricted directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privilege Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target Windows system with low privileges.
*   **File System Write Access:** The attacker needs to write the malicious `openssl.cnf` file to a directory accessible by the vulnerable service.
