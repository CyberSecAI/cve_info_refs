The provided content is a vulnerability report from Talos Intelligence, and it is related to CVE-2021-21940.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-based buffer overflow exists in the `pushMuxer` process of Anker Eufy Homebase 2 due to insufficient bounds checking when handling RTSP packets. The `ProcessRtspInfo` function iterates through active RTSP sessions. If a session's `pkt_read_status` is 3, data is read from an offset within the receive buffer (`recv_buf`). However, the read size is always 0x800 bytes regardless of the offset. This, combined with the fact that an attacker can control `read_ptr` within `recvpkt` can allow for controlled out-of-bounds writes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)
- Lack of proper bounds checking in `RecvData` and `ProcessRecvData`.
- Uncontrolled read length.
- Ability for an attacker to manipulate the `read_ptr` via crafted RTSP packets.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can lead to a heap buffer overflow, allowing an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory on the heap including the adjacent `RTSPSession` structures.
- This can lead to arbitrary code execution and full control of the device by manipulating pointers and function calls within the adjacent `RTSPSession` object.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted RTSP network packet to the vulnerable device.
- The attacker needs to send an initial RTSP packet without `\r\n\r\n` within the first 0x800 bytes to set `pkt_read_status` to 3. Then, a subsequent packet triggers the overflow due to the lack of bounds check within `RecvData` at [7].

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device, specifically the RTSP server on the Eufy Homebase 2.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication or credentials to trigger the vulnerability (no authentication required).
