Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-21696:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control in Jenkins regarding agent access to the `libs/` directory within build directories when using `FilePath` APIs. This directory stores shared libraries used by the Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries Plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of limitation of agent read/write access to the `libs/` directory inside build directories.
- This vulnerability is present in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers with control over agent processes can replace trusted library code with malicious variants.
- This leads to unsandboxed code execution within the Jenkins controller process, potentially allowing for complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to control an agent process.
- The attacker then leverages the ability to write to the `libs/` directory to overwrite trusted libraries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have control of a Jenkins agent process connected to the vulnerable Jenkins controller.

The provided content gives more details than the standard CVE description by explaining the specific directory (`libs/`) and plugin (Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries) involved, and clarifies the impact as unsandboxed code execution on the controller.
