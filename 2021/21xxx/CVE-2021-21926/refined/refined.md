```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application misuses prepared statements and stored procedures combined with SQL concatenation. Variables used to build the SQL query, despite initial sanitization, lose that protection when invoked against the database because the final prepared statement is simply taken from the @sql variable without specific parameter bindings.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary SQL injection, potentially allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete data, or execute arbitrary database commands.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially-crafted HTTP request to the ‘device_list’ page with a malicious value in the ‘health_filter’ parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated user. The attack can also be performed via cross-site request forgery."
