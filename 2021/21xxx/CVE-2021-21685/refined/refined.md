Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21685:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that `FilePath#mkdirs` in Jenkins versions 2.318 and earlier, and LTS 2.303.2 and earlier, does not check permissions when creating parent directories. This means that an agent process could create directories in locations where it shouldn't have access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Insufficient permission checks during directory creation using the `FilePath#mkdirs` method.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker controlling an agent process can create directories on the Jenkins controller file system in locations that are not intended for agent access. This could lead to further exploitation if combined with other vulnerabilities, or allow writing to sensitive locations.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Malicious agent process sending commands to the Jenkins controller to create directories using `FilePath#mkdirs`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have control of a Jenkins agent process that is connected to the vulnerable Jenkins controller.

**Additional Notes**

- This vulnerability is part of a group of vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-21685 through CVE-2021-21695) related to path filtering bypass.
- The fix is implemented in Jenkins 2.319 and LTS 2.303.3, where the `FilePath#mkdirs` now checks permissions to create parent directories.
