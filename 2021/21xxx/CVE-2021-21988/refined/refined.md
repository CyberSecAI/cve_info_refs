Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-21988

**Root Cause:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability within the Cortado ThinPrint component, specifically in the JPEG2000 parser. The process does not properly validate user-supplied data when parsing JPEG2000 codestreams embedded in EMF files, leading to a read past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read.
- Improper validation of user-supplied data within the JPEG2000 parser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure from the TPView process running on the system where Workstation or Horizon Client for Windows is installed.
- Can potentially be leveraged with other vulnerabilities for privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution in the hypervisor context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious actor with access to a virtual machine or remote desktop.
- The attacker needs to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system.
- Exploitation is possible if virtual printing has been enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to a virtual machine or remote desktop.
- Ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system.
- Virtual printing must be enabled.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in VMware Workstation and Horizon Client for Windows.
- The issue is in the Cortado ThinPrint component.
- VMware has released patches to address this vulnerability in Workstation version 16.1.2 and Horizon Client version 5.5.2.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 3.2 according to VMware, and 6.5 according to ZDI.
- The ZDI advisory notes that the attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor.
- The issue affects the JPEG2000 parser of the ThinPrint component.
