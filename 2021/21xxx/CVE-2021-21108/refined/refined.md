Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21108:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error in the media component of the Chromium browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free: This occurs when a program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior or exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the browser.
- Denial of service: The vulnerability could also lead to a denial of service by crashing the browser.
- Information disclosure: While not explicitly mentioned, use-after-free vulnerabilities can sometimes be exploited to leak sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote exploitation: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely, meaning an attacker can trigger it via a malicious webpage or content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver malicious content to a user via the Chromium browser. This could involve hosting a compromised website, injecting malicious code into a legitimate website, or using other methods of content delivery.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Leecraso and Guang Gong of 360 Alpha Lab.
- The fix is included in Chromium version 87.0.4280.141.
- The vulnerability is considered high severity.

In summary, CVE-2021-21108 is a high-severity vulnerability in the Chromium browser due to a use-after-free error in the media component. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, and potentially information disclosure. The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by a malicious webpage.
