Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-21691:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the Jenkins agent-to-controller security subsystem, specifically in how it handles file path filtering.
- The specific issue for CVE-2021-21691 is that creating symbolic links is possible without the necessary `symlink` permission.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Permission Checks:** The system allows the creation of symbolic links without proper authorization, specifically bypassing the check for the `symlink` permission.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File System Access:** By creating symbolic links, an attacker controlling an agent can potentially gain access to files and directories on the Jenkins controller that would otherwise be restricted. This could lead to:
    - **Information Disclosure:** Reading sensitive files on the controller.
    - **Data Manipulation:** Modifying files on the controller.
    - **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially gaining further control over the Jenkins controller.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Agent-to-Controller Communication:** The vulnerability is exploited through the communication channel between Jenkins agents and the controller.
- **Symbolic Link Creation:** An attacker controlling a Jenkins agent can use the agent's ability to interact with the controller's file system to create a malicious symbolic link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Control over a Jenkins Agent:** The attacker must have the ability to execute commands on a Jenkins agent that is connected to a vulnerable Jenkins controller. This means that they must either have access to an existing agent or be able to compromise an agent.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-21685 through CVE-2021-21695) related to path filtering bypass in Jenkins.
- This specific vulnerability has been present since at least 2014, when similar issues were addressed.
- The fix involves implementing proper `symlink` permission checks before allowing the creation of symbolic links.
- The advisory also recommends upgrading to Jenkins 2.319, LTS 2.303.3, or applying a workaround plugin to prevent agent-to-controller file access
