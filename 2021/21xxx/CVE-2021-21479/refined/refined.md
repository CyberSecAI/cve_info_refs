- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the possibility of injecting and executing Java expressions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or validation, which allows for the injection of arbitrary Java expressions. This results in a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can compromise the availability and integrity of the system, meaning an attacker could disrupt the service or modify data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious Java expressions, likely through a user-supplied input field or parameter processed by the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need the ability to provide the crafted input that contains the malicious Java expression. The specific location or method of injection is not specified but implied through standard web application interaction.
