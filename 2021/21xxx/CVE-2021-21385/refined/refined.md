Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2021-21385.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Mifos Mobile application was disabling HTTPS hostname verification and accepting self-signed certificates.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295):** The application was not properly validating the server's SSL/TLS certificate. Specifically it was accepting any self-signed certificate.
*   **Incorrect Hostname Verification (CWE-297):** The application was disabling hostname verification, which is a critical part of ensuring that the client is communicating with the intended server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks:** By disabling hostname verification and accepting any certificate (even self-signed), an attacker can intercept and modify the communication between the application and the server. This allows an attacker to potentially steal sensitive data, including credentials, financial information, and other personal data.

**Attack vectors:**
*   A network attacker positioned between the mobile application and the server can intercept traffic. The attacker can then use a self-signed certificate or a certificate from another domain to impersonate the legitimate server to the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the mobile application and the server (e.g., by being on the same Wi-Fi network or compromising a network device).
*   The attacker needs to be able to present a fraudulent certificate to the client.
