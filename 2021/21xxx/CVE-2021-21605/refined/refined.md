The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21605.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of agent names, allowing users with Agent/Configure permission to choose agent names that can cause Jenkins to override unrelated `config.xml` files. Specifically, the vulnerability allows for path traversal by including characters in the agent name that could lead to the overwriting of the global `config.xml` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal vulnerability via agent names.
- Inadequate validation of user-provided agent names.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Overwriting of the global `config.xml` file.
- Jenkins restarting with unsafe legacy defaults after a restart.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attackers must have Agent/Configure permission.
- Attackers can inject malicious agent names through the Jenkins UI or API.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker must have "Agent/Configure" permissions in Jenkins.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate or specify the agent name.
