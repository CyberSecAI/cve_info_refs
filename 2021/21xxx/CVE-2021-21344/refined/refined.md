**5. Content from x-stream.github.io (Security Aspects):**

*   **Vulnerability:** XStream has several vulnerabilities including CVE-2021-21344, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Root Cause:** The document explains that by design, XStream has few limits to the types of objects it handles, and uses Java reflection to convert data to Java objects. By manipulating the input data, an attacker can cause arbitrary code execution.
*  **Weakness/Vulnerabilities:** The default blacklist is insufficient, enabling potential code injection through crafted input.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution is possible by injecting the XML representation of other objects.
*   **Attack Vector:** Input manipulation is the attack vector.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  An attacker able to manipulate the data processed by XStream.
*   **Additional Information:**
    *   The documentation recommends implementing a whitelist of explicitly allowed types.
    *   Blacklists are considered as creating a false sense of security since it's difficult to account for all vulnerable classes.

**6. Content from x-stream.github.io (CVE-2021-21344):**

*   **Vulnerability:** XStream is vulnerable to an Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) attack (CVE-2021-21344).
*   **Root Cause:**  The processed input stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate formerly written objects. This vulnerability arises when an attacker manipulates the input stream to inject code from a remote server.
*  **Weakness/Vulnerabilities:**  XStream creates new instances based on type information, and an attacker could manipulate this mechanism.
*   **Impact:** Remote execution of arbitrary code is possible by manipulating the XStream's input XML data

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-21344 is a critical vulnerability in XStream that allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code by manipulating the input data stream. This is due to an insufficient default blacklist within XStream's Security Framework. The vulnerability is addressed in XStream versions 1.4.16 and higher (though users with custom whitelist configurations were not affected) and corresponding updates and advisories are released by third-party vendors.

**Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper validation and sanitization of input data, allowing the injection of malicious code via type information within the input stream.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Insufficient default blacklist leading to code injection through crafted XML/JSON data.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server, potential for data disclosure/modification, and Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Attack Vector:** Manipulation of the input stream (e.g. XML, JSON) processed by XStream.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote attacker with ability to control the input data stream; no specific privileges or user interaction required for the exploitation
