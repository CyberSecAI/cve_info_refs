{
  "CVE-2021-21840": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow vulnerability when decoding the \"saio\" atom.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Heap-based Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a heap-based buffer overflow, which can lead to arbitrary code execution under the context of the library.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted MPEG-4 file",
       "Convincing user to open a malicious file"
     ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted MPEG-4 file that triggers the integer overflow in the 'saio' atom parsing logic, and then convince a user to open it.",
    "details": "The saio_box_read function reads a 32-bit integer representing the number of entries. It performs an insufficient check against a 64-bit size. The library then multiplies the 32-bit count by the size of a u32 or u64, based on the 'version' field. Due to an integer overflow, this can lead to an undersized buffer being allocated. When the data is later read, it overflows the undersized buffer."
