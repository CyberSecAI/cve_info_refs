Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21675:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `requests-plugin` for Jenkins did not require POST requests for certain actions, allowing for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CSRF vulnerability: The plugin lacked proper CSRF protection, meaning that an attacker could craft malicious web pages that would trick a user's browser into sending requests to the Jenkins server, without the user's knowledge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can create requests and/or trick administrators into applying pending requests.
- This could lead to actions like renaming or deleting jobs, deleting builds, and other unauthorized changes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attackers can exploit this via malicious web pages, links or other means that cause the victim's browser to send POST requests without their consent to the vulnerable endpoints in the plugin.
- The attack requires the victim to be logged into their Jenkins instance and have the necessary permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs no specific prior access to the Jenkins instance, but they need to be able to induce a Jenkins user with appropriate permissions (administrators) to unknowingly trigger malicious requests.

**Affected Plugin:**
- `requests-plugin`

**Affected Versions:**
- `requests-plugin` versions 2.2.12 and earlier.

**Fixed Version:**
- `requests-plugin` version 2.2.13 addresses this vulnerability.
