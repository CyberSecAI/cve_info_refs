- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `FilePath#untar` method in Jenkins did not check for permissions when creating symbolic links during unarchiving.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient permission checks when creating symbolic links during the `untar` operation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker controlling an agent process can create arbitrary symbolic links on the Jenkins controller's file system, potentially leading to unauthorized access, modification or deletion of files, and potentially code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** An agent process controlled by an attacker can send a crafted archive to the Jenkins controller, which, when extracted by `FilePath#untar`, would create symbolic links pointing to arbitrary locations.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have control over an agent process connected to the Jenkins controller.
