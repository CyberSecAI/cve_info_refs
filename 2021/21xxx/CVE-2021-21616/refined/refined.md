Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21616:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Active Choices Plugin, in versions 2.5.2 and earlier, fails to properly escape reference parameter values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper escaping allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the parameter values. This injected script will be executed in the browsers of users who view the vulnerable job configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser when they view the affected job configuration. This can lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the Jenkins interface
    *   Stealing sensitive information
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into reference parameter values within job configurations.
*   When other users access these configurations, the injected script is executed within their browsers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have "Job/Configure" permission, allowing them to modify job configurations where the vulnerable Active Choices parameters are used.

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-21616 is a stored XSS vulnerability in the Jenkins Active Choices Plugin. Due to improper escaping of reference parameter values, an attacker with "Job/Configure" permissions can inject malicious JavaScript. When a user views the manipulated job configuration, the malicious script executes within their browser, potentially leading to significant security breaches.
