- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization on the `dir` parameter in the `FsBrowsePage` functionality of the Lantronix PremierWave 2050 Web Manager. The application attempts to restrict file browsing to the `/ltrx_user/` directory, but fails to sanitize path traversal sequences like `/../` in the `dir` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path Traversal (CWE-22) vulnerability due to inadequate input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass the intended directory restriction and gain the ability to list files and directories outside the `/ltrx_user/` directory, leading to information disclosure.  The vulnerability is limited to disclosing file and directory names.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP POST request to the `/` endpoint, using the `ajax=FsBrowsePage&dir=/../etc/` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be authenticated as an unprivileged user of the PremierWave 2050 web manager to exploit this vulnerability.
