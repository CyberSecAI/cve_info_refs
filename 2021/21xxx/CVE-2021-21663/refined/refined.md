Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21663:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin (version 10.0.1 and earlier) does not perform a proper permission check in a method implementing form validation.
*   The form validation method does not require POST requests, leading to a CSRF vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Permission Check:** The plugin fails to verify if the user has the necessary permissions to access the form validation method.
*   **Incorrect Permission Check**: The plugin had a permission check that was not for the right permission, still allowing access to non-admin users.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The form validation method lacks the requirement for POST requests, enabling CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credentials Capture:** Attackers can leverage this vulnerability, combined with another vulnerability to obtain credentials IDs, to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs to capture username/password credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Unauthorized Access/Actions**:  Attackers with Overall/Read permission can exploit the missing permission check.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** An attacker would need network access to the Jenkins instance.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable form validation method.
*   **CSRF**: The lack of POST request enforcement enables CSRF attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Overall/Read Permission:** The attacker needs to have at least Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
*   **Knowledge of Credentials IDs:**  The attacker needs to obtain the credentials IDs, likely through exploiting another vulnerability.

**Summary of CVE-2021-21663:**

CVE-2021-21663 is part of a set of vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-21663, CVE-2021-21664, and CVE-2021-21665) that impact the XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin for Jenkins. It is caused by missing permission checks in a form validation method. It also contributes to a CSRF vulnerability. Successful exploitation allows an attacker with "Overall/Read" permissions and knowledge of a credentials ID to connect to an attacker specified URL, capturing credentials.
