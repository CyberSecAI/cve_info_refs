Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21360:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control on log and snapshot files generated by the Generic Setup Tool. These files were accessible to anonymous users due to improper permission settings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive information contained within the log and snapshot files. This information could include installation details, configurations, and other potentially sensitive data.
- **Missing access control:** The log and snapshot files were not properly secured with appropriate permissions, allowing unauthorized users to view them.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to installation logs and snapshot files could reveal sensitive information about the system's configuration, potentially aiding further attacks or compromising data confidentiality.
- The impact is rated as low severity because the exposed information is likely to be installation logs and configuration data which may not be critical in all situations.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by simply accessing the URLs where the log and snapshot files are stored.
- The attack does not require any specialized technical skills or tools, making it relatively easy to exploit.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or prior access to the system.
- The attacker only needs to be able to access the web application and discover the location of the vulnerable log/snapshot files.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves enforcing access control on setup tool log files and snapshot files/folders. The fix was introduced in version 2.1.1 of `Products.GenericSetup`.
- A workaround was provided which involved manually configuring the permissions in the ZMI (Zope Management Interface) to restrict access to `Manager` and `Owner` roles only.
- The vulnerability was reported by Calum Hutton.
