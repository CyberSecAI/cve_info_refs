From: Maurits van Rees <maurits@...rees.org>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: Plone security hotfix 20210518

A Plone security hotfix was released on Tuesday, May 18 2021.
For details, see <https://plone.org/security/hotfix/20210518>
Most CVE numbers are not yet issued. I will request them from Mitre shortly.

BTW, I am following the instructions at
<https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security#cve-requests>
to first post to this list, then request CVEs at Mitre, then reply to my
own post.
I don't see many other people doing it in this order. Is that page still
accurate?

Versions Affected: All supported Plone versions (4.3.20 and any earlier
4.3.x version, 5.2.4 and any earlier 5.x version).

Versions Not Affected: None. Earlier versions may be affected, but the
hotfix has not been tested on them.

The patch addresses several security issues:

- Remote Code Execution via traversal in expressions. Reported by David
Miller. CVE-2021-32633.
- Writing arbitrary files via docutils and Python Script. Reported by
Calum Hutton.
- Various information disclosures: mostly installation logs. Reported by
Calum Hutton. CVE-2021-21360 and CVE-2021-21336.
- Stored XSS from file upload (svg, html). Reported separately by Emir
Cüneyt Akkutlu and Tino Kautschke.
- Reflected XSS in various spots. Reported by Calum Hutton.
- XSS vulnerability in CMFDiffTool. Reported by Igor Margitich.
- Stored XSS from user fullname. Reported by Tino Kautschke.
- Blind SSRF via feedparser accessing an internal URL. Reported by
Subodh Kumar Shree.
- Server Side Request Forgery via event ical URL. Reported by MisakiKata
and David Miller.
- Server Side Request Forgery via lxml parser. Reported by MisakiKata
and David Miller.

A hotfix package has been created at
<https://pypi.org/project/Products.PloneHotfix20210518/>
The fixes will be incorporated in future release Plone 5.2.5.
