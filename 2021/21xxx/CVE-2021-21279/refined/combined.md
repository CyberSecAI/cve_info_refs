# Infinite loop in IPv6 neighbor solicitation processing

Moderate

[joakimeriksson](/joakimeriksson)
published
GHSA-rr5j-j8m8-fc4f
Jun 18, 2021

## Package

Contiki-NG

## Affected versions

< 4.6

## Patched versions

4.6

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can perform a denial-of-service attack by triggering an infinite loop in the processing of IPv6 neighbor solicitation (NS) messages. This type of attack can effectively shut down the operation of the system because of the cooperative scheduling used for the main parts of Contiki-NG and its communication stack.

The problem exists in the ns\_input function in the os/net/ipv6/uip-nd6.c module, where the `nd6_opt_offset` variable is expected to be incremented in a loop that performs options processing. The `nd6_opt_offset` variable is an unsigned 8-bit integer that can overflow in the addition on line 246,

```
nd6_opt_offset += (ND6_OPT_HDR_BUF(nd6_opt_offset)->len << 3);

```

This statement depends on an insufficiently validated value taken from the input packet, and can be crafted by an attacker so that the value is not incremented, which results in the infinite loop.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG 4.6.

### Workarounds

Users can apply the patch in [Contiki-NG PR #1410](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1410).
