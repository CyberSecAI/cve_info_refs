- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `FilePath#renameTo` and `FilePath#moveAllChildrenTo` operations in Jenkins only check read permissions on the source path, which is insufficient for these operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient permission checks on source paths during rename/move operations.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows attackers in control of agent processes to potentially move or rename files on the Jenkins controller file system, leading to disruption or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By leveraging agent-to-controller communication via `FilePath#renameTo` and `FilePath#moveAllChildrenTo` operations.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have control of an agent process connected to the Jenkins controller.
