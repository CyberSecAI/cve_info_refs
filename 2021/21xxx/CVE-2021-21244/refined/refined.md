Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21244:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper configuration of the Bean Validation framework (JSR 380) in the `onedev` application. Specifically, while EL (Expression Language) interpolation was disabled in most parts of the application to prevent arbitrary code execution, it was still enabled within the Jersey REST framework due to a different `ValidatorFactory` configuration in `ValidationConfigurationContextResolver`. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious EL expressions through unexpected query parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Bean Validation:** The primary weakness is the presence of a SSTI vulnerability through message interpolation within the Bean Validation framework. Specifically, the `ValidQueryParamsValidator` class did not properly sanitize or disable EL interpolation before using the value of an unexpected query parameter in an error message.
*   **Inconsistent Validator Configuration:** The application used different configurations for the validator factory in different contexts (general application vs. Jersey REST), which created an inconsistent validation behavior and exposed the vulnerability.
*  **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application failed to sanitize or escape user-controlled data that was used within the error message, allowing injection of arbitrary code via EL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Pre-Authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can achieve pre-auth RCE by sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious EL expression in a query parameter. The expression will be evaluated by the server before any authentication or authorization checks are performed. This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary Java code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Query Parameters:** The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to any REST endpoint that uses the `ValidQueryParamsValidator` where an unexpected query parameter containing a malicious EL expression is added.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoints and EL Syntax:** The attacker needs to know which endpoints are susceptible and how to construct a valid EL payload to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.0.3 of `onedev` by disabling validation interpolation completely.
*   The vulnerable code snippet is located in the `ValidQueryParamsValidator.java` file.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by `@pwntester`.
*   The GitHub Security Advisory ID is GHSA-vm26-xg39-cfj4.
