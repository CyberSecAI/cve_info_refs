The provided content is a vulnerability report from Talos Intelligence, detailing multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the 'device_list' page of Advantech R-SeeNet 2.4.15. This report includes a specific section for CVE-2021-21933

**CVE-2021-21933:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command, specifically within the handling of the 'esn\_filter' parameter. The application uses prepared statements and stored procedures with SQL concatenation in a way that allows variables, despite being initially sanitized, to lose this protection and become vulnerable to SQL injection when executed against the database.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `device_list` page due to the improper handling of the `esn_filter` parameter. The `esn_filter` parameter is set as a session variable and later used in a SQL query without proper sanitization, even though `mysqli_real_escape_string` is used, the vulnerability lies in how the SQL query is constructed using a stored procedure, where the sanitized variable is concatenated into a string, and then executed using a prepared statement without proper binding of parameters.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, and complete compromise of the database server.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the `device_list` page, specifically manipulating the `esn_filter` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, or exploit the vulnerability through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Any authenticated user has the ability to exploit the vulnerability, which makes it easier for attackers.
