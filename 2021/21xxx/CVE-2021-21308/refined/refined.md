Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21308:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper session management during a soft logout in PrestaShop. The soft logout mechanism did not completely invalidate the session, allowing an attacker to potentially exploit existing customer sessions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper session management**: The core issue is that the session is not fully invalidated during a soft logout. The session identifiers and tokens are not being properly cleared.
- **Incomplete logout**: The soft logout process fails to remove all session-related data, leaving the user vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially make unauthorized requests and execute customer commands using existing sessions. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Accessing user accounts and personal information.
    - Modifying user data, such as addresses and payment information.
    - Making fraudulent purchases.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the logged-out user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting the incomplete soft logout functionality.
- An attacker could potentially use a session that has not been properly invalidated during soft logout.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept or somehow utilize a session from a user who has performed a soft logout.
- This might involve techniques such as session hijacking, or using some form of cross site scripting to steal the token.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in PrestaShop version 1.7.7.2.
*   The related GitHub Security Advisory is [GHSA-557h-hf3c-whcg](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/security/advisories/GHSA-557h-hf3c-whcg)
*   The fix includes changes to the `Cookie.php` file to ensure the session is properly cleared during logout by adding a function `mylogout()` which calls `$this->deleteSession()` and unsets session variables like `id_customer` and `id_guest`. Additionally, the `isSessionAlive()` function was modified to include a check for both `session_id` and `session_token`, instead of checking if either of them is missing.
