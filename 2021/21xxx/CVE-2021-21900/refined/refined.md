Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-21900:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free in the `dxfRW::processLType()` function of the `libdxfrw` library used by LibreCAD.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The `DRW_TableEntry::reset()` function frees memory associated with `extData` entries but does not zero the `curr` pointer. Subsequently, a code path in `DRW_TableEntry::parseCode` attempts to use this dangling pointer to write data, resulting in a use-after-free.
- The `curr` pointer, which is a member of `DRW_TableEntry`, is not reset to NULL when `DRW_TableEntry::reset` is called from `DRW_LType::reset`. This allows a later attempt to access the freed memory using the dangling `curr` pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** The use-after-free vulnerability can be exploited by providing a specially crafted .dxf file. Since the vulnerability occurs when a function pointer is called, and the first argument to the function is controlled by the attacker, arbitrary code execution becomes possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted .dxf File:** The attacker must provide a specially crafted .dxf file to the vulnerable application (LibreCAD).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to get the vulnerable software (LibreCAD) to open a malicious .dxf file. This could be done by sending it as an email attachment, hosting it on a website, or any other method that convinces a user to open a malicious file with LibreCAD.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs specifically in the processing of LTYPE (linetype) data within a .dxf file.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a sequence of group codes in a .dxf file, specifically, a `1010-1013` followed by a `0` code with the `LTYPE` value, then another `1020-1023` or `1030-1033` code.
- When a new LTYPE is encountered (group code `0` with group value `LTYPE`), the `DRW_LType::reset()` function is called. This, in turn, calls `DRW_TableEntry::reset()`, which frees the memory pointed to by members in `extData` without resetting the `curr` pointer.

**Additional Notes**
- This vulnerability is triggered by a specific sequence of opcodes in the DXF file that manipulates `DRW_TableEntry` and `DRW_LType` objects and their members.
- The provided crash information and backtrace clearly identify the UAF occurring at `DRW_Variant::setCoordY(double)` and the memory deallocation in `DRW_TableEntry::reset()`.
- The vulnerability is present in `libdxfrw` versions before the patch and is exploitable through the LibreCAD application by opening a malicious DXF file.
