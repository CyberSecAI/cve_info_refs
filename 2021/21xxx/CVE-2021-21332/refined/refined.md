{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The password reset endpoint did not properly escape variables within HTML templates, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of output sanitization in HTML templates."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to access cookies and other browser data, execute CSRF attacks, and gain access to resources on the same domain or parent domains.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is present in the password reset endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the variables used in the password reset HTML template. This can happen via manipulating user data that flows into this template, or potentially via other means of indirect code injection."
