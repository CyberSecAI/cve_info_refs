### VMware Cloud Foundation Known Issues

* **Workload Management does not support NSX-T Data Center Federation**

  You cannot deploy Workload Management (vSphere with Tanzu) to a workload domain when that workload domain's NSX-T Data Center instance is participating in an NSX-T Data Center Federation.

  Workaround: None.
* **NSX-T Guest Introspection (GI) and NSX-T Service Insertion (SI) are not supported on stretched clusters**

  There is no support for stretching clusters where NSX-T Guest Introspection (GI) or NSX-T Service Insertion (SI) are enabled. VMware Cloud Foundation detaches Transport Node Profiles from AZ2 hosts to allow AZ-specific network configurations. NSX-T GI and NSX-T SI require that the same Transport Node Profile be attached to all hosts in the cluster.

  Workaround: None
* **Stretched clusters and Workload Management**

  You cannot stretch a cluster on which Workload Management is deployed.

  Workaround: None
* **Special characters not allowed in the Username, Password, and Template Name fields on the Microsoft CA Configuration page**

  If any of the following special characters are used in the Username, Password, or Template Name fields on the Microsoft CA Configuration page, the configuration cannot be saved:

  + Ampersand (&)
  + Single quote (')
  + Double quote (")
  + Less than (<)
  + Greater than (>)
  + Tab

  Workaround: Delete the special character and then save the configuration.
* **Different vCenter Server build numbers on SDDC Manager and vCenter Server UI**

  The vCenter Server build number on the vCenter Server UI is different from the build number displayed on SDDC Manager.

  Workaround: None.

### Upgrade Known Issues

* **Async Patch Tool Known Issues**

  The Async Patch Tool is a utility that allows you to apply critical patches to certain VMware Cloud Foundation components (NSX-T Manager, vCenter Server, and ESXi) outside of VMware Cloud Foundation releases. The Async Patch Tool also allows you to enable upgrade of an async patched system to a new version of VMware Cloud Foundation.

  See the [Async Patch Tool Release Notes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/services/rn/async-patch-tool-release-notes/index.html) for known issues.
* **Cluster-level ESXi upgrade fails**

  Cluster-level selection during upgrade does not consider the health status of the clusters and may show a cluster's status as **Available**, even for a faulty cluster. If you select a faulty cluster, the upgrade fails.

  Workaround: Always perform an update precheck to validate the health status of the clusters. Resolve any issues before upgrading.
* **When you skip hosts during an ESXi upgrade of a vLCM-enabled workload domain, the upgrade may fail**

  Due to a known vSphere issue, the ESXi upgrade may fail with a "ConstraintValidationException" error when a host is skipped.

  Workaround: Check the vSphere Client and its logs for details on what caused the error. Resolve the issues and retry the upgrade.
* **When you upgrade to VMware Cloud Foundation 4.1, one of the vSphere Cluster Services (vCLS) agent VMs gets placed on local storage**

  vSphere Cluster Services (vCLS) is new functionality in vSphere 7.0 Update 1 that ensures that cluster services remain available, even when the vCenter Server is unavailable. vCLS deploys three vCLS agent virtual machines to maintain cluster services health. When you upgrade to VMware Cloud Foundation 4.1, one of the vCLS VMs may get placed on local storage instead of shared storage. This could cause issues if you delete the ESXi host on which the VM is stored.

  Workaround: Deactivate and reactivate vCLS on the cluster to deploy all the vCLS agent VMs to shared storage.

  1. Check the placement of the vCLS agent VMs for each cluster in your environment.

     1. In the vSphere Client, select **Menu > VMs and Templates**.
     2. Expand the vCLS folder.
     3. Select the first vCLS agent VM and click the Summary tab.
     4. In the Related Objects section, check the datastore listed for Storage. It should be the vSAN datastore. If a vCLS agent VM is on local storage, you need to deactivate vCLS for the cluster and then re-enable it.
     5. Repeat these steps for all vCLS agent VMs.
  2. Deactivate vCLS for clusters that have vCLS agent VMs on local storage.

     1. In the vSphere Client, click **Menu > Hosts and Clusters**.
     2. Select a cluster that has a vCLS agent VM on local storage.
     3. In the web browser address bar, note the moref id for the cluster.

        For example, if the URL displays as https://vcenter-1.vrack.vsphere.local/ui/app/cluster;nav=h/urn:vmomi:ClusterComputeResource:domain-c8:503a0d38-442a-446f-b283-d3611bf035fb/summary, then the moref id is domain-c8.
     4. Select the vCenter Server containing the cluster.
     5. Click **Configure > Advanced Settings**.
     6. Click **Edit Settings**.
     7. Change the value for `config.vcls.clusters.<moref id>.enabled` to `false` and click **Save**.

        If the `config.vcls.clusters.<moref id>.enabled` setting does not appear for your moref id, then enter its Name and `false` for the Value and click **Add**.
     8. Wait a couple of minutes for the vCLS agent VMs to be powered off and deleted. You can monitor progress in the Recent Tasks pane.
  3. Enable vCLS for the cluster to place the vCLS agent VMs on shared storage.

     1. Select the vCenter Server containing the cluster and click **Configure > Advanced Settings**.
     2. Click **Edit Settings**.
     3. Change the value for `config.vcls.clusters.<moref id>.enabled` to `true` and click **Save**.
     4. Wait a couple of minutes for the vCLS agent VMs to be deployed and powered on. You can monitor progress in the Recent Tasks pane.
  4. Check the placement of the vCLS agent VMs to make sure they are all on shared storage
* **You are unable to update NSX-T Data Center in the management domain or in a workload domain with vSAN principal storage because of an error during the NSX-T transport node precheck stage**

  In SDDC Manager, when you run the upgrade precheck before updating NSX-T Data Center, the NSX-T transport node validation results with the following error.

  `No coredump target has been configured. Host core dumps cannot be saved.:System logs on host sfo01-m01-esx04.sfo.rainpole.io are stored on non-persistent storage. Consult product documentation to configure a syslog server or a scratch partition.`

  Because the upgrade precheck results with an error, you cannot proceed with updating the NSX-T Data Center instance in the domain. VMware Validated Design supports vSAN as the principal storage in the management domain. However, vSAN datastores do no support scratch partitions. See VMware KB article [2074026](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2074026).

  Workaround: Deactivate the update precheck validation for the subsequent NSX-T Data Center update.

  1. Log in to SDDC Manager as `vcf` using a Secure Shell (SSH) client.
  2. Open the `application-prod.properties` file for editing.

     `vi /opt/vmware/vcf/lcm/lcm-app/conf/application-prod.properties`
  3. Add the following property and save the file.

     `lcm.nsxt.suppress.prechecks=true`
  4. Restart the life cycle management service.

     `systemctl restart lcm`
  5. Log in to the SDDC Manager user interface and proceed with the update of NSX-T Data Center.
* **NSX-T upgrade may fail at the step NSX T TRANSPORT NODE POSTCHECK STAGE**

  NSX-T upgrade may not proceed beyond the `NSX T TRANSPORT NODE POSTCHECK STAGE`.

  Workaround: Contact VMware support.
* **Bundle transfer utility command retrieves incorrect bundle types**

  When you run the bundle transfer utility command to retrieve install bundles, the results include install and configuration drift bundles.

  Workaround: Review bundle components to validate the bundle type.
* **Workload Management upgrade fails**

  Workload Management can be upgraded only after NSX-T, vCenter Server, and ESXi have been upgraded. If you try upgrading Workload Management before upgrading these components, the upgrade fails.

  Workaround: Contact VMware Support.
* **ESXi hosts with an HPE custom image cannot be upgraded**

  On ESXi hosts with an HPE custom image, the HPE Agentless Management Service (amsd) blocks the upgrade of NSX components with the following error message:

  `Error loading plugin /usr/lib/vmware/esxcli/ext/smad_rev.xml skipping. Error was: Error while trying to register the plugin /usr/lib/vmware/esxcli/ext/smad_rev.xml Duplicate top-level namespaces must have the samesma The functionality in /usr/lib/vmware/esxcli/ext/smad_rev.xml will not be available until this issue is resolved.`

  Impacted versions and components are listed below.

  + HPE Server Line : ProLiant
  + HPE Add-on/Custom Image Version : 701.0.0.10.7.0-71
  + ESXi Base Image build : 7.0 U1d - 17551050
  + amsdComponent Version : 701.11.7.1.3-1
  + amshelprComponent Version : 701.11.7.0.14-1
  + HPE Server Line : Synergy
  + HPE Add-on/Custom Image Version : 701.0.0.10.7.5-16
  + ESXi Base Image build : 7.0 U1d - 17551050
  + amsdComponent Version : 701.11.7.1.3-1
  + amshelprComponent Version : 701.11.7.0.14-1

  Workaround: Before upgrading to VMware Cloud Foundation 4.2.1, apply the fix described in the HPE Customer advisory <https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/docDisplay?docId=emr_na-a00116792en_us>.

### Bring-up Known Issues

* **The Cloud Foundation Builder VM remains locked after more than 15 minutes.**

  The VMware Imaging Appliance (VIA) locks out the admin user after three unsuccessful login attempts. Normally, the lockout is reset after fifteen minutes but the underlying Cloud Foundation Builder VM does not automatically reset.

  Log in to the VM console of the Cloud Foundation Builder VM as the `root` user. Unlock the account by resetting the password of the admin user with the following command:

  `pam_tally2 --user=<user> --reset`

### SDDC Manager Known Issues

* **Deactivating CEIP on SDDC Manager does not deactivate CEIP on vRealize Automation and vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager**

  When you deactivate CEIP on the SDDC Manager Dashboard, data collection is not deactivated on vRealize Automation and vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager. This is because of API deprecation in vRealize Suite 8.x.

  Workaround: Manually deactivate CEIP in vRealize Automation and vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager. For more information, see VMware vRealize Automation Documentation and VMware vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager Documentation.
* **Generate CSR task for a component hangs**

  When you generate a CSR, the task may fail to complete due to issues with the component's resources. For example, when you generate a CSR for NSX Manager, the task may fail to complete due to issues with an NSX Manager node. You cannot retry the task once the resource is up and running again.

  Workaround:

  1. Log in to the UI for the component to troubleshoot and resolve any issues.
  2. Using SSH, log in to the SDDC Manager VM with the user name `vcf`.
  3. Type **su** to switch to the root account.
  4. Run the following command:

     `systemctl restart operationsmanager`
  5. Retry generating the CSR.
* **SoS utility options for health check are missing information**

  Due to limitations of the ESXi service account, some information is unavailable in the following health check options:

  + `--hardware-compatibility-report`: No `Devices and Driver` information for ESXi hosts.
  + `--storage-health:` No `vSAN Health Status` or `Total no. of disks` information for ESXi hosts.

  Workaround: None.
* **Host information on the Inventory -> Hosts page takes too long to load or does not load**

  When a large number of hosts are unassigned, the Inventory -> Hosts page may take up to three minutes to reflect hosts information or may display the following message: `Failed to load host details, Please retry or contact the service provider and provide the reference token`

  Workaround: Use VMware Cloud Foundation APIs for all host-related tasks.
* **Host commissioning may fail if API /v1/hosts/validations/commissions is used immediately after the host validation API /v1/hosts/validationsDescription**

  If you run the host validation API `/v1/hosts/validations/commissions` immediately after the host validation API `/v1/hosts/validations`, the validation workflow may delete temporary truststore created by the host commissioning workflow. This may cause host commissioning to fail.

  Workaround: After host validation, wait for at least one minute before running the host commissioning API.

### Workload Domain Known Issues

* **Cannot reuse a static IP pool that includes special characters in its name**

  If you chose Static IP Pool as the IP allocation method when creating a VI workload domain and you used special characters or spaces in the IP pool name, you are not able to reuse the IP pool when creating a new VI workload domain or adding a vSphere cluster to the workload domain.

  Workaround: Use only supported characters when naming a static IP pool. Supported characters:

  + a-z
  + A-Z
  + 0-9
  + - and \_
  + No spaces

  If you have an existing static IP pool that includes unsupported characters in its name, you can use the NSX Manager UI to rename it.
* **Adding host fails when host is on a different VLAN**

  A host add operation can sometimes fail if the host is on a different VLAN.

  1. Before adding the host, add a new portgroup to the VDS for that cluster.
  2. Tag the new portgroup with the VLAN ID of the host to be added.
  3. Add the Host. This workflow fails at the "Migrate host vmknics to dvs" operation.
  4. Locate the failed host in vCenter, and migrate the vmk0 of the host to the new portgroup you created in step 1. For more information, see [Migrate VMkernel Adapters to a vSphere Distributed Switch](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.networking.doc/GUID-0DE237B8-1938-4DE9-90EC-718E345B56A0.html) in the vSphere product documentation.
  5. Retry the Add Host operation.

  **NOTE**: If you later remove this host in the future, you must manually remove the portgroup as well if it is not being used by any other host.
* **Deploying partner services on an NSX-T workload domain displays an error**

  Deploying partner services, such as McAfee or Trend, on a workload domain enabled for vSphere Update Manager (VUM), displays the “Configure NSX at cluster level to deploy Service VM” error.

  Workaround: Attach the Transport node profile to the cluster and try deploying the partner service. After the service is deployed, detach the transport node profile from the cluster.
* **If the witness ESXi version does not match with the host ESXi version in the cluster, vSAN cluster partition may occur**

  vSAN stretch cluster workflow does not check the ESXi version of the witness host. If the witness ESXi version does not match the host version in the cluster, then vSAN cluster partition may happen.

  Workaround:

  1. Upgrade the witness host manually with the matching ESXi version using the vCenter VUM functionality.
  2. Replace or deploy the witness appliance matching with the ESXi version.
* **vSAN partition and critical alerts are generated when the witness MTU is not set to 9000**

  If the MTU of the witness switch in the witness appliance is not set to 9000, the vSAN stretch cluster partition may occur.

  Workaround: Set the MTU of the witness switch in the witness appliance to 9000 MTU.
* **VI workload domain creation or expansion operations fail**

  If there is a mismatch between the letter case (upper or lower) of an ESXi host's FQDN and the FQDN used when the host was commissioned, then workload domain creation and expansion may fail.

  Workaround: ESXi hosts should have lower case FQDNs and should be commissioned using lower case FQDNs.
* **Adding a host to a vLCM-enabled workload domain configured with the Dell Hardware Support Manager (OMIVV) fails**

  When you try to add a host to a vSphere cluster for a workload domain enabled with vSphere Lifecycle Manager (vLCM), the task fails and the domain manager log reports "The host (host-name) is currently not managed by OMIVV." The domain manager logs are located at /var/log/vmware/vcf/domainmanager on the SDDC Manager VM.

  Workaround: Update the hosts inventory in OMIVV and retry the add host task in the SDDC Manager UI. See the Dell documentation for information about updating the hosts inventory in OMIVV.
* **Adding a vSphere cluster or adding a host to a workload domain fails**

  Under certain circumstances, adding a host or vSphere cluster to a workload domain fails at the `Configure NSX-T Transport Node or Create Transport Node Collection` subtask.

  Workaround:

  1. Enable SSH for the NSX Manager VMs.
  2. SSH into the NSX Manager VMs as `admin` and then log in as `root`.
  3. Run the following command on each NSX Manager VM:

     `sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_en=0`
  4. Login to NSX Manager UI for the workload domain.
  5. Navigate to **System > Fabric > Nodes > Host Transport Nodes**.
  6. Select the vCenter server for the workload domain from the **Managed by** drop-down menu.
  7. Expand the vSphere cluster and navigate to the transport nodes that are in a `partial success` state.
  8. Select the check box next to a `partial success` node, click **Configure NSX.** .
  9. Click `Next` and then click `Apply`.
  10. Repeat steps 7-9 for each `partial success` node.

  When all host issues are resolved, transport node creation starts for the failed nodes. When all hosts are successfully created as transport nodes, retry the failed add vSphere cluster or add host task from the SDDC Manager UI.
* **The vSAN Performance Service is not enabled for vSAN clusters when CEIP is not enabled**

  If you do not enable the VMware Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) in SDDC Manager, when you create a workload domain or add a vSphere cluster to a workload domain, the vSAN Performance Service is not enabled for vSAN clusters. When CEIP is enabled, data from the vSAN Performance Service is provided to VMware and this data is used to aid VMware Support with troubleshooting and for products such as VMware Skyline, a proactive cloud monitoring service. See [Customer Experience Improvement Program](https://www.vmware.com/solutions/trustvmware/ceip.html) for more information on the data collected by CEIP.

  Enable CEIP in SDDC Manager. See the [VMware Cloud Foundation Documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/index.html). After CEIP is enabled, a scheduled task that enables the vSAN Performance Service on existing clusters in workload domains runs every three hours. The service is also enabled for new workload domains and clusters. To enable the vSAN Performance Service immediately, see the [VMware vSphere Documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/index.html).
* **Creation or expansion of a vSAN cluster with more than 32 hosts fails**

  By default, a vSAN cluster can grow up to 32 hosts. With large cluster support enabled, a vSAN cluster can grow up to a maximum of 64 hosts. However, even with large cluster support enabled, a creation or expansion task can fail on the sub-task **Enable vSAN on vSphere Cluster**.

  Workaround:

  1. Enable Large Cluster Support for the vSAN cluster in the vSphere Client. If it is already enabled skip to step 2.

     1. Select the vSAN cluster in the vSphere Client.
     2. Select **Configure > vSAN > Advanced Options**.
     3. Enable Large Cluster Support.
     4. Click **Apply**.
     5. Click **Yes**.
  2. Run a vSAN health check to see which hosts require rebooting.
  3. Put the hosts into Maintenance Mode and reboot the hosts.

  For more information about large cluster support, see <https://kb.vmware.com/kb/2110081>.
* **Removing a host from a cluster, deleting a cluster from a workload domain, or deleting a workload domain fails if Service VMs (SVMs) are present**

  If you deployed an endpoint protection service (such as guest introspection) to a cluster through NSX-T Data Center, then removing a host from the cluster, deleting the cluster, or deleting the workload domain containing the cluster will fail on the subtask `Enter Maintenance Mode on ESXi Hosts`.

  Workaround:

  + For host removal: Delete the Service VM from the host and retry the operation.
  + For cluster deletion: Delete the service deployment for the cluster and retry the operation.
  + For workload domain deleting: Delete the service deployment for all clusters in the workload domain and retry the operation.
* **vCenter Server overwrites the NFS datastore name when adding a cluster to a VI workload domain**

  If you add an NFS datastore with the same NFS server IP address, but a different NFS datastore name, as an NFS datastore that already exists in the workload domain, then vCenter Server applies the existing datastore name to the new datastore.

  Workaround: If you want to add an NFS datastore with a different datastore name, then it must use a different NFS server IP address.
* **Deleting a cluster that was renamed in the vSphere Client does not delete the cluster's transport node profile or uplink profile**

  When you use the vSphere Client to rename a cluster and then delete that cluster from SDDC Manager, the transport node profile and uplink profile associated with the cluster are not removed.

  Workaround: Manually delete the transport node profile and uplink profile from NSX Manager and try deleting the cluster again.

  1. Log in to the NSX Manager UI.
  2. Identify and delete the uplink profile associated with the cluster's old name.

     1. Navigate to **System > Fabric > Profiles > Uplink Profiles** and identify the uplink profile for the deleted cluster.

        Uplink profile names follow the pattern: **<vcenter host name>-<old-cluster-name>**.

        For example, if the vCenter Server's FQDN is **vcenter-vsan.vrack.vsphere.local**, and the cluster's old name is **nsxt-datacenter**, then uplink profile name would be **vcenter-vsan-nsxt-cluster**.
     2. Select the uplink profile and click **Delete**.
  3. Identify and delete the transport node profile associated with the cluster's old name.

     1. Navigate to **System > Fabric > Profiles > Transport Node Profiles** and identify the transport node profile for the deleted cluster. Transport node profile names follow the same pattern as uplink profile names.
     2. Select the transport node profile and click **Delete**.
  4. In SDDC Manager, try deleting the cluster again.
* **Add host may fail for cluster using vLCM images**

  Add host for cluster using vLCM images may fail with the following error: `Unable to create transport node collection. Transport Node Collection is failed with state FAILED_TO_REALIZEWorkflow`

  Workaround: Re-try the add host workflow.

### Multi-Instance Management Known Issues

* **Federation creation information not displayed if you leave the Multi-Instance Management Dashboard**

  Federation creation progress is displayed on the Multi-Instance Management Dashboard. If you navigate to another screen and then return to the Multi-Instance Management Dashboard, progress messages are not displayed. Instead, an empty map with no Cloud Foundation instances are displayed until the federation is created.

  Stay on the Multi-Instance Dashboard till the task is complete. If you have navigated away, wait for around 20 minutes and then return to the dashboard by which time the operation should have completed.
* **Multi-Instance Management Dashboard operation fails**

  After a controller joins or leaves a federation, Kafka is restarted on all controllers in the federation. It can take up to 20 minutes for the federation to stabilize. Any operations performed on the dashboard during this time may fail.

  Re-try the operation.
* **Join operation fails**

  A join operation may fail if a controller SDDC Manager has a public certificate with a depth greater than one (that is, it has intermediate certificates).

  Workaround: Trust the intermediate certificate of the controller SDDC Manager. See [KB 80986](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/80986).

### API Known Issues

* **Stretch cluster operation fails**

  If the cluster that you are stretching does not include a powered-on VM with an operating system installed, the operation fails at the "Validate Cluster for Zero VMs" task.

  Make sure the cluster has a powered-on VM with an operating system installed before stretching the cluster.

* **When you deploy a vRealize Suite product in vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager, some of the infrastructure details may not be loaded**

  When you deploy a vRealize Suite product in vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager, the Infrastructure details may not get populated. This may indicate a failed vCenter data collection request in vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager, which prevents vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager from validating the current state of vCenter Server inventory.

  Workaround: Retry the failed vCenter data collection request until it successfully passes and then try to complete the vRealize Suite product deployment again.

  1. In vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager, click **Lifecycle Operations > Datacenters**.
  2. Click the refresh icon for the management vCenter Server to refresh data collection.
  3. Click **Requests** and wait for request to be successful.
  4. Retry the product deployment.
* **Updating the DNS or NTP server configuration does not apply the update to vRealize Automation**

  Using the Cloud Foundation API to update the DNS or NTP servers does not apply the update to vRealize Automation due to a bug in vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager.

  Workaround: Manually update the DNS or NTP server(s) for vRealize Automation.

  **Update the DNS server(s) for vRealize Automation**

  1. SSH to the first vRealize Automation node using root credentials.
  2. Delete the current DNS server using the following command:

     `sed '/nameserver.*/d' -i /etc/resolv.conf`
  3. Add the new DNS server IP with following command:

     `echo nameserver [DNS server IP] >> /etc/resolv.conf`
  4. Repeat this command if there are multiple DNS servers.
  5. Validate the update with the following command:

     `cat /etc/resolv.conf`
  6. Repeat these steps for each vRealize Automation node.

  **Update the NTP server(s) for vRealize Automation**

  1. SSH to the first vRealize Automation node using root credentials.
  2. Run the following command to specify the new NTP server:

     `vracli ntp systemd --set [NTP server IP]`

     To add multiple NTP servers:

     `vracli ntp systemd --set [NTP server 1 IP,NTP server 2 IP]`
  3. Validate the update with the following command:

     `vracli ntp show-confi`
  4. Apply the update to all vRealize Automation nodes with the following command:

     `vracli ntp apply`
  5. Validate the update by running the following command on each vRealize Automation node:

     `vracli ntp show-config`
* **Connecting vRealize Log Insight to a workload domain fails at the "Enable Log Collection for vSphere" step**

  When you connect vRealize Log Insight to a workload domain, it fails at the `Enable Log Collection for vSphere` step. Expanding the connect workflow task in the SDDC Manager Recent Tasks widget displays the following errors:

  + `Cannot configure vCenter in vRealize Log Insight`
  + `Failed post request in vRLI`

  Workaround: Reboot the vRLI VMs.

  1. Log in to the management vCenter Server.
  2. Click **Virtual Machines** in the VMware Host Client inventory.
  3. Select a vRealize Log Insight VM.
  4. Right-click the VM and select **Guest OS** -> **Restart**.
  5. After the VM has been powered on, repeat steps 3 and 4 for each vRealize Log Insight VM.
  6. Validate that the vRealize Log Insight UI is accessible.
  7. In the SDDC Manager Recent Tasks panel, select the failed task and click **Restart Task**.
* **vRealize Suite product deployment fails with error "Failed to get Environment ID by given Host Name"**

  When you deploy multiple vRealize Suite products simultaneously in vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager, product registration with SDDC Manager may fail.

  Workaround: Deploy vRealize Suite products one at a time.
* **Connecting vRealize Operations Manager to a workload domain fails at the "Create vCenter Server Adapter in vRealize Operations Manager for the Workload Domain" step**

  When you connect vRealize Operations Manager to a workload domain, it fails at the `Create vCenter Server Adapter in vRealize Operations Manager for the Workload Domain` step with a message similar to `Failed to configure vCenter <vcenter-hostname> in vROps <vrops-hostname>, because Failed to manage vROps adapter`. This issue can occur when the vRealize Operations cluster is offline.

  Workaround: Make sure that the vRealize Operations cluster is online.

  1. Log in to the vRealize Operations Manager administration interface.
  2. Click **Administration > Cluster Management** and check the cluster status.
  3. If the vRealize Operations cluster is offline, bring the cluster online.
  4. When the cluster status displays as online, retry connecting vRealize Operations Manager to a workload domain.

#### Issue/Introduction

Vulnerabilities in plugins that ship with vCenter Server have been disclosed by VMware. These vulnerabilities and their impact on VMware products are documented in the following VMware Security Advisories (VMSAs), please review these documents before continuing:

* CVE-2021-21972 - [VMSA-2021-0002](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0002.html) (vRealize Operations Manager Plugin)
* CVE-2021-21985 - [VMSA-2021-0010](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0010.html) (Virtual SAN Health Check Plugin)
* CVE-2021-21986 - [VMSA-2021-0010](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0010.html) (Virtual SAN Health Check, Site Recovery, vSphere Lifecycle Manager, and VMware Cloud Director Availability Plugins)

VMware has investigated these issues and has determined that the possibility of exploitation can be removed via disablement of impacted plugins by performing the steps detailed in the Workaround section of this article.

#### Resolution

The workarounds described in this document are meant to be a temporary solution only.
Upgrades documented in the aforementioned advisories should be applied to resolve vulnerabilities in impacted plugins.

Workaround:
**Important**: Plugins must be set to "incompatible." Disabling a plugin from within the UI does not prevent exploitation.

The following actions must be performed on both the active and passive nodes in environments running vCenter High Availability (VCHA).

**The examples documented here show the steps to disable all plugins which have been impacted by vulnerabilities disclosed by VMware. Depending on the environment and requirements, there may only be a need to disable a subset of these plugins.
Please see the** [**VMSA-2021-0010: What You Need to Know**](https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2021/05/vmsa-2021-0010.html)  **blog to determine the plugins that are required to be disabled in the configuration being used.**

Add the lines below to the compatibility-matrix.xml file to disable each individual plugin:

| **Plugin Name** | **Configuration Line** |
| --- | --- |
| VMware vRops Client Plugin | <PluginPackage id="com.vmware.vrops.install" status="incompatible"/> |
| VMware vSAN H5 Client Plugin | <PluginPackage id="com.vmware.vsphere.client.h5vsan" status="incompatible"/> |
| Site Recovery | <PluginPackage id="com.vmware.vrUi" status="incompatible"/> |
| VMware vSphere Life-cycle Manager | <PluginPackage id="com.vmware.vum.client" status="incompatible"/> |
| VMware Cloud Director Availability | <PluginPackage id="com.vmware.h4.vsphere.client" status="incompatible"/> |

Some plugins are enabled by default, and these default plugins differ from version to version.
Please refer to the table below to determine which plugin is enabled by default and which plugin requires the associated product to be installed and configured.

**Default** = Plugin is enabled by default on all vCenter installations
**Product** = Plugin is enabled only when the associated product is installed and configured

| **vCenter Version** | **vRealize Operations** | **vSAN** | **VMware vSphere Life-cycle Manager** | **Site Recovery** | VMware Cloud Director Availability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6.5 | Default | Default (6.5 U3k and later) | N/A | Product | Product |
| 6.7 | Default | Default | N/A | Product | Product |
| 7.0 | Default | Default | Default | Product | Default |

To implement the workaround, follow the steps applicable for the type of vCenter Server deployment being used.

### Upgrade Known Issues

* **The vRealize Automation upgrade reports the "Precheck Execution Failure : Make sure the latest version of VMware Tools is installed" message**

  The vRealize Automation IaaS VMs must have the same version of VMware Tools as the ESXi hosts on which the VMs reside.

  Workaround: Upgrade VMware Tools on the vRealize Automation IaaS VMs.
* Error upgrading vRealize Automation

  Under certain circumstances, upgrading vRealize Automation may fail with a message similar to:

  ```
  An automated upgrade has failed. Manual intervention is required.
  vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager Pre-upgrade checks for vRealize Automation have failed:
  vRealize Automation Validations : iaasms1.rainpole.local : RebootPending : Check if reboot is pending : Reboot the machine.
  vRealize Automation Validations : iaasms2.rainpole.local : RebootPending : Check if reboot is pending : Reboot the machine.
  Please retry the upgrade once the upgrade is available again.
  ```

  1. Log-in into the first VM listed in the error message using RDP or the VMware Remote Console.
  2. Reboot the VM.
  3. Wait 5 minutes after the login screen of the VM appears.
  4. Repeat steps 1-3 for the next VM listed in the error message.
  5. Once you have restarted all the VMs listed in the error message, retry the vRealize Automation upgrade.
* **When there is no associated workload domain to vRealize Automation, the VRA VM NODES CONSISTENCY CHECK upgrade precheck fails**

  This upgrade precheck compares the content in the logical inventory on the SDDC Manager and the content in the vRealize Lifecycle Manager environment. When there is no associated workload domain, the vRealize Lifecycle Manager environment does not contain information about the `iaasagent1.rainpole.local` and `iaasagent2.rainpole.local` nodes. Therefore the check fails.

  Workaround: None. You can safely ignore a failed `VRA VM NODES CONSISTENCY CHECK` during the upgrade precheck. The upgrade will succeed even with this error.
* **NSX Data Center for vSphere upgrade fails with the message "Host Prep remediation failed"**

  After addressing the issue, the NSX Data Center for vSphere bundle no longer appears as an available update.

  Workaround: To complete the upgrade, manually enable the anti-affinity rules.

  1. Log in to the management vCenter Server using the vSphere Client.
  2. Click **Menu > Hosts and Clusters** and select the cluster on which host prep remediation failed (for example SDDC-Cluster1).
  3. Click **Configure > Configuration > VM/Host Rules**.
  4. Select **NSX Controller Anti-Affinity Rule** and click **Edit**.
  5. Select **Enable rule** and click **OK**.

  This completes the NSX Data Center for vSphere upgrade.
* **Lifecycle Management displays fatal error**

  When the user password in the `/opt/vmware/vcf/lcm/lcm-app/conf/application.properties` file contains a backslash (\), Lifecycle Manager does not start and displays the fatal error `Password authentication failed for user lcm`.

  Workaround: Follow the steps below to resolve the error:

  1. SSH to the SDDC Manager VM.
  2. Type `su` to switch to root user.
  3. Open the `/opt/vmware/vcf/lcm/lcm-app/conf/application.properties` file, remove all backslashes (\) from the `lcm.datasource.password` field, and save the file.
  4. Run the command `systemctl restart lcm-db`.
* **Task panel does not show correct upgrade tasks for NSX-T workload domain upgrades**

  When you upgrade NSX-T workload domains. the task panel does not show upgrade status correctly. This is a UI issue only and there is no impact on the upgrade workflow.

  Workaround: Monitor upgrade status by navigating to the Update/Patches tab of the relevant workload domain:

  1. On the SDDC Manager Dashboard, click *Inventory* -> *Workload Domains*.
  2. In the Domain column, click the appropriate workload domain name.
  3. Click the *Update/Patches* tab.
  4. Monitor upgrade status.
* **Exception displayed when a scheduled NSX-T upgrade begins during an idle SDDC Manager session**

  When a scheduled NSX-T upgrade begins during an idle SDDC Manager session, the following UI exception is displayed: Retrieving NSXT upgrade failed with unknown exception

  This is a UI issue only. There is no impact on the upgrade workflow.

  Workaround: Refresh the web browser.
* **Inapplicable ESXi upgrade bundles are displayed after upgrade has been scheduled**

  After you schedule an ESXi upgrade on a workload domain, upgrade bundles are displayed until ESXi has been upgraded on all clusters. You can ignore these bundles.

  Workaround: None.

### vRealize Suite Known Issues

* **vRealize Operations Manager: VMware Security Advisory VMSA-2021-0018**

  [VMSA-2021-0018](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0018.html) describes security vulnerabilities that affect VMware Cloud Foundation.

  + The vRealize Operations Manager API contains an arbitrary file read vulnerability. A malicious actor with administrative access to vRealize Operations Manager API can read any arbitrary file on server leading to information disclosure.The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned identifier CVE-2021-22022 to this issue.
  + The vRealize Operations Manager API has insecure object reference vulnerability. A malicious actor with administrative access to vRealize Operations Manager API may be able to modify other users information leading to an account takeover.The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned identifier CVE-2021-22023 to this issue.
  + The vRealize Operations Manager API contains an arbitrary log-file read vulnerability. An unauthenticated malicious actor with network access to the vRealize Operations Manager API can read any log file resulting in sensitive information disclosure. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned identifier CVE-2021-22024 to this issue.
  + The vRealize Operations Manager API contains a broken access control vulnerability leading to unauthenticated API access. An unauthenticated malicious actor with network access to the vRealize Operations Manager API can add new nodes to existing vROps cluster. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned identifier CVE-2021-22025 to this issue.
  + The vRealize Operations Manager API contains a Server Side Request Forgery in multiple end points. An unauthenticated malicious actor with network access to the vRealize Operations Manager API can perform a Server Side Request Forgery attack leading to information disclosure. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned identifiers CVE-2021-22026 and CVE-2021-22027 to this issue.

  Workaround: See [KB 85452](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/85452) for information about applying vRealize Operations Security Patches that resolve the issues.
* **The password update for vRealize Automation and vRealize Operations Manager may run infinitely or may fail when the password contains special character "%"**

  Password management uses the vRealize Lifecycle Manager API to update the password of vRealize Automation and vRealize Operations Manager. When there is special character "%" in either of SSH or API or Administrator credential types of the vRealize Automation and vRealize Operations Manager users, then the vRealize Lifecycle Manager API hangs and doesn't respond to password management. There is a timeout of 5 mins and password management marks the operation as failed.

  Workaround:Retry the password update operation without the special character "%". Ensure that the passwords for all other vRealize Automation and vRealize Operations Manager accounts don't contain the "%" special character.
* **vRealize Log Insight installation gets stuck due to incorrect MTU configuration**

  During deployment, Edge Service Gateways send frames with the MTU specified in the **Universal Distributed Logical Router - MTU Size** field in the deployment parameters file to the Top of Rack switches. If this MTU size is not configured correctly in your infrastructure, the vRealize Log Insight deployment may hang on an installation task after the `Apply vRealize Log Insight License` task.

  If any of these tasks remain incomplete for more than 30 minutes. follow the workaround below.

  1. Fix the routing between the Edge-vTEP network and ESXi-vTEP network
  2. SSH to the Cloud Builder VM.
  3. Switch to root:

     `sudo -i`
  4. Restart the bring-up service:

     `systemctl restart vcf-bringup`
  5. Wait five minutes to get all services online.
  6. Retry the bring-up process.

### Networking Known Issues

* **NSX Manager is not visible in the vSphere Web Client.**

  In addition to NSX Manager not being visible in the vSphere Web Client, the following error message displays in the NSX Home screen: "No NSX Managers available. Verify current user has role assigned on NSX Manager." This issue occurs when vCenter Server is not correctly configured for the account that is logged in.

  Workaround: To resolve this issue, follow the procedure detailed in Knowledge Base article 2080740 ["No NSX Managers available" error in the vSphere Web Client](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2080740).

### SDDC Manager Known Issues

* **Unable to delete VI workload domain enabled for vRealize Operations Manager from SDDC Manager.**

  Attempts to delete the vCenter adapter also fail, and return an SSL error.

  Workaround: Use the following procedure to resolve this issue.

  1. Create a vCenter adapter instance in vRealize Operations Manager, as described in [Configure a vCenter Adapter Instance in vRealize Operations Manager](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Operations-Manager/7.5/com.vmware.vcom.config.doc/GUID-19DAD6AF-7262-4655-B69F-6C665E33B52F.html). This step is required because the existing adapter was deleted by the failed workload domain deletion.
  2. Follow the procedure described in [Knowledge Base article 56946](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/56946).
  3. Restart the failed VI workload domain deletion workflow from the SDDC Manager interface.
* **APIs for managing SDDC cannot be executed from the SDDC Manager Dashboard**

  You cannot use the API Explorer in the SDDC Manager Dashboard to execute the APIs for managing SDDC (`/v1/sddc`).

  Workaround: None. These APIs can only be executed using the Cloud Builder as the host.
* **Add host workflow fails**

  Add host workflow fails with the following error message:

  `Unable to update transport node: {\n    messages = [],\n    data = struct => {error_message=General error has occurred., details=Discovered node with id:3e9c025a-d5ae-4e7e-ab5d-a30b5269689d:host-51 is already prepared having fabric node id:Node/dd6562e9-34ce-45ae-aff7-7624c01df788., error_code=100, module_name=common-services}\n}"`

  Workaround: On the NSX-T UI, uninstall NSX for the failed transport node.

### Workload Domain Known Issues

* **Adding host fails when host is on a different VLAN**

  A host add operation can sometimes fail if the host is on a different VLAN.

  Workaround:

  1. Before adding the host, add a new portgroup to the VDS for that cluster.
  2. Tag the new portgroup with the VLAN ID of the host to be added.
  3. Add the Host. This workflow fails at the "Migrate host vmknics to dvs" operation.
  4. Locate the failed host in vCenter, and migrate the vmk0 of the host to the new portgroup you created in step 1. For more information, see [Migrate VMkernel Adapters to a vSphere Distributed Switch](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.networking.doc/GUID-0DE237B8-1938-4DE9-90EC-718E345B56A0.html) in the vSphere product documentation.
  5. Retry the Add Host operation.

  **NOTE**: If you later remove this host in the future, you must manually remove the portgroup as well if it is not being used by any other host.
* **NSX Manager for VI workload domain is not displayed in vCenter**

  Although NFS-based VI workload domains are created successfully, the NSX Manager VM is not registered in vCenter Server and is not displayed in vCenter.

  Workaround: To resolve this issue, use the following procedure:

  1. Log in to NSX Manager (http://<nsxmanager IP>).
  2. Navigate to **Manage > NSX Management Service**.
  3. Un-register the lookup service and vCenter, then re-register.
  4. Close the browser and log in to vCenter.
* **A vCenter Server on which certificates have been rotated is not accessible from a Horizon workload domain**

  VMware Cloud Foundation does not support the certificate rotation on the Horizon workload domains.

  Workaround: See KB article [70956](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/70956).
* **Deploying partner services on an NSX-T workload domain displays an error**

  Deploying partner services on an NSX-T workload domain such as McAfee or Trend displays the “Configure NSX at cluster level to deploy Service VM” error.

  Workaround: Attach the Transport node profile to the cluster and try deploying the partner service. After the service is deployed, detach the transport node profile from the cluster.
* **If the witness ESXi version does not match with the host ESXi version in the cluster, vSAN cluster partition may occur**

  vSAN stretch cluster workflow does not check the ESXi version of the witness host. If the witness ESXi version does not match the host version in the cluster, then vSAN cluster partition may happen.

  Workaround:

  1. Upgrade the witness host manually with the matching ESXi version using the vCenter VUM functionality.
  2. Replace or deploy the witness appliance matching with the ESXi version.
* **vSAN partition and critical alerts are generated when the witness MTU is not set to 9000**

  If the MTU of the witness switch in the witness appliance is not set to 9000, the vSAN stretch cluster partition may occur.

  Workaround: Set the MTU of the witness switch in the witness appliance to 9000 MTU.
* The certificate rotate operation on the second NSX-T domain fails

  Certificate rotation works on the first NSX-T workload domain in your environment, but fails on all subsequent NSX-T workload domains.

  Workaround: None
* **Operations on NSX-T workload domains fails if their host FQDNs include uppercase letters**

  If the FQDNs of ESXi hosts in an NSX-T workload domain include uppercase letters, then the following operations may fail for the workload domain:

  + Add a host
  + Remove a host
  + Add a cluster
  + Remove a cluster
  + Delete the workload domain

  Workaround: See [KB 76553](http://kb.vmware.com/kb/76553).
* **Creating an NSX-T workload domain fails on the task "Add management domain vCenter as compute manager"**

  This can happen if a previous attempt to create an NSX-T workload domain failed and Cloud Foundation was unable to clean up after the failed task.

  Workaround: Manually remove the NSX-T Data Center extension from the management vCenter Server and try to create the NSX-T workload domain again. See [Remove NSX-T Data Center Extension from vCenter Server](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.5/administration/GUID-E6E2F017-1106-48C5-ABCA-3D3E9130A863.html).
* **VI workload domain creation or expansion operations fail**

  If there is a mismatch between the letter case (upper or lower) of an ESXi host's FQDN and the FQDN used when the host was commissioned, then workload domain creation and expansion may fail.

  Workaround: ESXi hosts should have lower case FQDNs and should be commissioned using lower case FQDNs.
* **Cluster is deleted even if VMs are up and running on the cluster**

  When you delete a cluster, it gets deleted even if there are VMs running on the cluster. This includes critical VMs such as Edge VMs, which may prevent you from accessing your environment after the cluster gets deleted.

  Workaround: Migrate the VMs to a different cluster before deleting the cluster.
* **Workload domain operations fail if cluster upgrade is in progress**

  Workload domain operations cannot be performed if one or more clusters are being upgraded. The UI does not block such oeprations during an upgrade.

  Workaround: Do not perform any operations on the workload domain when a cluster upgrade is in progress.

### Security Operations Known Issues

* Addition of members from PKS UAA to Harbor library fails when the certificate verification is enabled

  This issue occurs when Harbor does not honor the certificate chain under **System Settings** > **Registry Root Certificate**.

  Workaround:

  1. SSH into the SDDC Manager VM as the `vcf` user.
  2. Run the following command. Make sure to update the password of the **admin** user and the Harbor URL: `curl -k -H'Content-type: application/json' -u admin:"< >" -XPUT https://harbor.vrack.vsphere.local/api/configurations -d '{"uaa_verify_cert":"false"}'`

  Harbor is in the UAA authentication mode and it uses members from PKS UAA.

  To create a user in UAA:

  1. Connect through SSH to Ops Manager appliance
  2. Run the following:

  `uaac target https://pks.vrack.vsphere.local:8443 --skip-ssl-validation`

  `uaac token client get admin`

  `uaac user add <<user-name> > --emails <<email> >`

### Multi-Instance Management Known Issues

* Federation creation information not displayed if you leave the Multi-Instance Management Dashboard

  Federation creation progress is displayed on the Multi-Instance Management Dashboard. If you navigate to another screen and then return to the Multi-Instance Management Dashboard, progress messages are not displayed. Instead, an empty map with no Cloud Foundation instances are displayed until the federation is created.

  Workaround: Stay on the Multi-Instance Dashboard till the task is complete. If you have navigated away, wait for around 20 minutes and then return to the dashboard by which time the operation should have completed.
* The federation creation progress is not displayed

  While federation creation is in progress, the SDDC manager UI displays the progress on the multi-site page. If you navigate into any other screen and come back to the multi-site screen, the progress messages are not displayed. An empty map with no VMware Cloud Foundation instances is displayed until the federation creation process completes.

  Workaround: None
* **Multi-Instance Management Dashboard operation fails**

  After a controller joins or leaves a federation, Kafka is restarted on all controllers in the federation. It can take up to 15 minutes for the federation to stabilize. Any operations performed on the dashboard during this time may fail.

  Workaround: Re-try the operation.

### API Known Issues

* **Unversionsed APIs are not Supported**

  Unversioned APIs in Cloud Foundation have been deprecated.

  Use Cloud Foundation public APIs.
