      "Description": "XStream is vulnerable to a Remote Command Execution attack.",

    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The XStream library deserializes XML/JSON data into Java objects. The vulnerability arises because the library blindly recreates objects based on type information embedded in the serialized data, allowing an attacker to manipulate this data to inject malicious objects that execute commands on the server.",
      "Vulnerability": "Remote Command Execution",
      "Impact": "Remote attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code or commands on the server by injecting manipulated object instances. This may lead to a total compromise of the affected system. It may also lead to data loss or modification, or denial of service.",
      "Attack Vector": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted XML/JSON document to a server or application that uses a vulnerable version of XStream to deserialize user supplied data.",
      "Attacker Capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to manipulate the input stream processed by the XStream library.",

      "Workarounds": "Apply available security patches immediately. It is possible to reduce risk by using XStream's security framework to implement a whitelist for the allowed types. Before applying the patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack, or removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need them. Both approaches may break application functionality, so it is recommended to test changes on non-production systems first."
