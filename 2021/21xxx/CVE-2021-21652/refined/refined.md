- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Xray - Test Management for Jira Plugin does not require POST requests for a connection test method.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs, which may have been obtained through another vulnerability, and capture credentials stored in Jenkins.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted request from a user's browser to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least Overall/Read permission. They also need to be able to obtain a credentials ID through another vulnerability.
