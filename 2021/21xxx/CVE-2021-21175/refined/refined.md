Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-21175:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is an "inappropriate implementation" within the Site Isolation feature of the Chromium browser. This suggests a logical flaw in how the site isolation mechanism was designed or implemented.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Inappropriate Implementation:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the way Site Isolation is implemented. This likely means there's a failure to properly isolate sites as intended, potentially bypassing security boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The provided information does not specify the direct impact of the vulnerability beyond stating it is a "medium" severity. However, vulnerabilities in site isolation can be critical. If an attacker can bypass site isolation, they might be able to:
    - **Access sensitive data from other sites:** This includes cookies, session tokens, and other information that should be kept separate.
    - **Perform actions on behalf of other users:** If the attacker can bypass isolation, they might be able to access resources and perform actions as if they were another user of a different site.
    - **Execute arbitrary code:** In extreme cases, bypassing site isolation can allow attackers to execute code in the context of another site. While not specifically mentioned for this CVE, the potential exists.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, but it would likely involve a malicious website attempting to exploit the inappropriate implementation of site isolation to compromise another site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Malicious Website:** The attacker would need to be able to host or control a malicious website.
- **User Interaction:** A user would likely have to visit the malicious website for the exploit to take place.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information indicates that this vulnerability is fixed in Chromium version 89.0.4389.72
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Medium" severity, indicating that it should be addressed but might not be as critical as a high severity vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Jun Kokatsu, Microsoft Browser Vulnerability Research.

**In summary,** CVE-2021-21175 represents a flaw in Chromium's Site Isolation implementation, allowing for potential security bypass. While the specific exploit details aren't given, the vulnerability's location suggests that it could lead to sensitive information disclosure and potentially more serious attacks if exploited.
