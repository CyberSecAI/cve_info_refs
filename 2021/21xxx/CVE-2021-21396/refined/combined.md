# Bulk list client endpoint exposes too much metadata about a client

High

[raphaelrobert](/raphaelrobert)
published
GHSA-qx8q-rhq2-rg4j
Mar 19, 2021

## Package

brig

## Affected versions

> 2021-02-16

## Patched versions

2021-03-02

## Description

This client metadata of all users was exposed in the `GET /users/list-clients` endpoint:

* id: Id of the device (public by design)
* class: Class of the device, could be desktop, mobile or legalhold (public by design)
* type: Type of the device, could be permanent, temporary or legalhold
* location: Coarse location of the device when it was registered (inferred from IP address)
* time: Time of registration of the device
* cookie: Label of the cookie, used to revoke cookies

The endpoint could be used by any logged in user who could request client details of any other user (no connection required) as far as they can find their User ID.

### Impact

A user on a Wire backend could use this endpoint to find registration time and location for each device for a given list of users.

### Patches

Fixed in <https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/releases/tag/v2021-03-02>

### Workarounds

Remove `/list-clients` from nginx config.

### References

N/A

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-21396

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
