Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21396:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `/users/list-clients` endpoint which exposed excessive metadata about a client that should not have been publicly available.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The endpoint returned sensitive information about users' devices, such as device type, registration location (coarse, derived from IP address), registration time, and cookie labels.
- **Lack of proper access control:** Any authenticated user was able to use the endpoint to query client details of any other user, given they knew the user ID, without requiring any prior connection or authorization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could use the vulnerability to:
- Obtain sensitive device information (type, location, registration time) for tracking purposes.
- Obtain cookie labels that could potentially be used in other attacks.
- Collect device registration information for other purposes
- Potentially infer user activity patterns and device usage by monitoring device registration times and location changes.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based: The attacker would send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint `/users/list-clients`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have an account and be logged in to the Wire backend.
- The attacker must know the User IDs of the users they want to target.

**Additional Details:**

The vulnerability was fixed by changing the `/users/list-clients` endpoint to return `PubClient` instead of `Client`. The `PubClient` type only includes the public `id` and `class` of the device.

The vulnerability was present in versions before 2021-03-02 and was fixed in version 2021-03-02.
