Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-21661:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the lack of permission checks in several HTTP endpoints within the Kubernetes CLI Plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Permission Checks:** The plugin fails to verify if the user accessing specific HTTP endpoints has the necessary permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential ID Enumeration:** Attackers with Overall/Read permissions can enumerate credential IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. This can be used as a stepping stone to capture the credentials using another vulnerability (not described in this CVE).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is carried out through HTTP endpoints.
*   **Authentication:** Requires a valid Jenkins user account with Overall/Read permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Jenkins User:**  The attacker needs to be a valid user with Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Jenkins instance.

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-21661 describes a vulnerability in the Kubernetes CLI Plugin for Jenkins where insufficient permission checks on HTTP endpoints allow authenticated users with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credential IDs. While the direct impact is limited to enumeration, this information can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate the attack and potentially compromise credentials.
