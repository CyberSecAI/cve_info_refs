The provided content relates to CVE-2021-21402.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient path validation in several API endpoints, specifically within the `HlsSegmentController`, `ImageByNameController`, and `SubtitleManager` components of the Jellyfin application. These endpoints did not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied file paths, leading to directory traversal vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is directory traversal, where an attacker can manipulate file paths to access files outside of the intended directories.
- **Inadequate Path Validation:** The application failed to properly validate user-supplied file paths, allowing for traversal using techniques like "../" sequences.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerabilities were exploitable without authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker could read any file on the server's file system that the Jellyfin process had access to. This could expose sensitive data, configuration files, or other resources.
- **Potential Data Breach:** The ability to access files on the server could lead to data breaches, depending on the sensitivity of the files accessed.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The attack is performed by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to vulnerable API endpoints of the Jellyfin server.
- **Manipulated File Paths:** Attackers inject malicious file path strings into the requests, allowing them to traverse directories.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Jellyfin server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of API endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable API endpoints such as those in `HlsSegmentController`, `ImageByNameController` and `SubtitleManager` to craft the malicious requests.
