Moderate

published
GHSA-wg4c-c9g9-rxhx
Mar 21, 2021

## Package

Jellyfin

## Affected versions

<=10.7.0

## Patched versions

10.7.1

## Description

### Impact

With certain endpoints, well crafted requests will allow arbitrary file read from a Jellyfin server's file system. This issue is more prevalent when Windows is used as the host OS. Servers that are exposed to the public Internet are potentially at risk.

### Patches

A patch is in maintenance release 10.7.1, available as of 2021-03-21.
