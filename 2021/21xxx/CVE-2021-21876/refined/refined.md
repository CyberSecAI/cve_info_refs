Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-21876

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization of the `host` parameter within the Lantronix PremierWave 2050's Web Manager FsTFtp functionality. This parameter is directly used in the construction of a `system` call to the `tftp` binary.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The application fails to neutralize special elements used in the `host` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands.
- **Insecure Use of `system`:** The application constructs a command string using user-supplied data and then executes it through the `system` call, which is vulnerable to injection attacks if the user-supplied data is not properly sanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges on the affected device.
- **Full System Compromise:** This can lead to complete control of the device, including the ability to modify configurations, install malware, or disrupt services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerabilities are triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the device's web interface.
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `host` parameter within the HTTP POST request is the vehicle for injecting malicious OS commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and authorized to access the device's web interface and file system browser.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameters:** The attacker needs knowledge of vulnerable parameters such as `host`, and how to craft HTTP requests to exploit them.
