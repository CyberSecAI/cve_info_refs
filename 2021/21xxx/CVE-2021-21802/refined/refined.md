- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `device_id` parameter in the `device_graph_page.php` script is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application fails to neutralize user-supplied input (`device_id` parameter) before including it in the HTML output.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted URL containing the malicious JavaScript within the `device_id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a URL with the malicious payload and convince a victim to visit it. No authentication or special privileges are required. The victim doesn't need to be logged in.
