The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21888.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by unsanitized and unverified user-controlled HTTP POST parameters being used in the `openssl` command executed via a `system` call. Specifically, the parameters `c`, `s`, `l`, `o`, `ou`, and `cn` from an HTTP POST request are used to construct the command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- OS Command Injection (CWE-78): The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a system command, allowing the injection of malicious commands.
- The `SslGenerateCertificate` function uses unsanitized parameters from the HTTP POST request to construct an openssl command, which is then executed using the `system` call with root privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges on the affected device. This could lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, modification, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/` endpoint with `ajax=SslGenerateCertificate` parameter, including other parameters like `c`, `s`, `l`, `o`, `ou`, and `cn` parameters, injecting arbitrary commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the web interface of the Lantronix PremierWave 2050 device with privileges to execute the SSL certificate generator function.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web interface of the device.
