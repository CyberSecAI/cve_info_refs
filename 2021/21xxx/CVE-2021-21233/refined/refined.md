Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-21233:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a heap buffer overflow within the ANGLE component of the Chromium browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** This means that a program writes data beyond the allocated buffer in the heap memory, potentially overwriting critical data structures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The provided content suggests this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution, as stated in the Gentoo security advisory: "Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Chromium and Google Chrome, the worst of which could result in the arbitrary execution of code."

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the ANGLE component, which is a graphics engine abstraction layer, implying that the vulnerability could be triggered through malicious or crafted web content that uses affected graphics APIs.
*   The Gentoo advisory also notes the exploitability as "local, remote", meaning an attacker could trigger this remotely or if they have local access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to be able to serve or inject content that triggers the vulnerable code path within ANGLE. This could happen via:
    *   A malicious website
    *   A compromised ad network
    *   A MITM attack injecting malicious code in a webpage
    *   If an attacker has local access, they could use this vulnerability to elevate privileges.
* The attacker does not need to have any special privileges for remote exploitation.

**Additional Information**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in Chromium version 90.0.4430.93.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Abraruddin Khan and Omair
*   This vulnerability is related to the graphics processing within the browser.
*   The vulnerability was found through internal audits and fuzzing
