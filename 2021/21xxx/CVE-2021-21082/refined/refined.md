Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow issue in Adobe Photoshop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** A buffer overflow condition exists, which allows an attacker to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. This means the attacker can potentially gain control of the system, install malware, steal data, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The specific attack vector is not detailed in the provided content, but it involves the use of a maliciously crafted file/data that triggers the buffer overflow. It is likely related to the handling of image data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted file or input to the vulnerable application (Adobe Photoshop). This could involve tricking a user into opening a malicious file, or exploiting a flaw in how Photoshop processes a specific type of data.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as "Critical" severity.
*   The vulnerability affects Photoshop 2020 (versions 21.2.5 and earlier) and Photoshop 2021 (versions 22.2 and earlier) on both Windows and macOS.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Kushal Arvind Shah of Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs.
*   Adobe has released updates (Photoshop 2020 version 21.2.6 and Photoshop 2021 version 22.3) to address this vulnerability. Users are urged to update to the latest versions.
