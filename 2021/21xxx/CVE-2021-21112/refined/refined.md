Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21112:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability in the Blink component of the Chromium browser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: This occurs when a program attempts to access memory after it has been freed, which can lead to unpredictable behavior and potentially code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on a user's system by exploiting the use-after-free vulnerability.
- Denial of service: A crash or other forms of denial of service may also be possible.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability exists in the Blink component which is part of the browser engine and is responsible for rendering web pages. Therefore, it is likely that the vulnerability could be triggered by a malicious website or crafted HTML content.
- An attacker could entice a user to visit a malicious website that exploits the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to deliver a specially crafted web page to the victim. This could be accomplished through:
    - Hosting a malicious website
    - Injecting malicious code into a legitimate website.
    - Social engineering attacks to lure users to malicious links.
- The attacker would not need any special position on the network or the victim's machine.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by YoungJoo Lee(@ashuu_lee) of Raon Whitehat on 2020-11-20.
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in Chromium version 87.0.4280.141 and later.
- The vulnerability is considered high severity.

In summary, CVE-2021-21112 is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Blink component of Chromium that can be exploited by an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code on a victim's machine through a malicious webpage.
