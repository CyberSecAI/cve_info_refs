```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to misuse of prepared statements in the context of the application, along with stored procedures combined with SQL concatenation. Variables used to build an SQL query, despite being initially sanitized, lose that protection when invoked against the database. Specifically, a final prepared statement is taken from a variable without specific parameter bindings.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the 'device_list' page. The vulnerable parameter 'host_alt_filter2' is passed through the URL.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user or be able to perform a cross-site request forgery attack."
