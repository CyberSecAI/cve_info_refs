Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-21300:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Git handles symbolic links and clean/smudge filters on case-insensitive file systems. Specifically, a race condition exists during the checkout process when handling symbolic links that can point to locations within the `.git/hooks` directory, allowing for the execution of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Inadequate Path Validation:** Git's checkout process, particularly with delayed-capable clean/smudge filters, does not properly validate leading components of a path, leading to potentially following symlinks to unintended locations.
2.  **Lstat Cache Invalidation:** When a path collision occurs (e.g. case-sensitive files on a case-insensitive file system) leading to the removal of a directory, the lstat cache is not correctly invalidated which might lead to usage of stale data. This is particularly problematic when the directory is replaced by a symlink.
3.  **Unordered Checkout:** The vulnerability is exposed when checkout operations don't follow the index order, such as during delayed checkout using `process` filters or with `checkout-index`, allowing outdated cached information to be used.
4.  **Clean/Smudge Filters:** The vulnerability requires the presence of globally configured delay-capable clean/smudge filters (like Git LFS), which are often used for large files and can trigger the exploit.
5.  **Case-Insensitive Filesystem:** The attack is only possible on case-insensitive file systems with support for symbolic links like NTFS, HFS+, or APFS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A malicious repository can be crafted to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during a `git clone` operation. The code runs with the privileges of the user performing the clone.
*   **Arbitrary File Write:** A malicious repository can, through the vulnerable handling of symlinks and lstat caching, overwrite arbitrary files on the filesystem of the user performing the clone, even outside the repository.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Repository:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted Git repository hosted on a remote source, that includes:
    *   A `.gitattributes` file which enables a delay capable clean/smudge filter such as LFS for at least one file.
    *   A symbolic link pointing into the `.git/hooks` directory.
    *   A malicious executable file within the `.git/hooks` directory.
    *   A file that enables the execution of code via the configured filter during checkout.
*   **Cloning from Untrusted Source:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user clones this malicious repository onto a vulnerable file system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Repository Hosting:** An attacker needs the capability to host a Git repository that a victim might clone.
*   **Understanding of Git Internals:** The attacker needs a solid understanding of Gitâ€™s internals, including how symbolic links, clean/smudge filters, and caching work.
*   **Case-Insensitive File System:** The exploit only works on case-insensitive filesystems, such as NTFS, HFS+ or APFS.
*   **Global Filter Configuration:** The attacker relies on the user having a global configuration which enables a delay capable clean/smudge filter such as Git LFS.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by cloning the repository to a case-insensitive filesystem which supports symlinks, such as NTFS, HFS+, or APFS.
*   Git for Windows is particularly vulnerable due to its default configuration, which includes Git LFS.
*   Disabling symbolic link support in Git or avoiding cloning from untrusted repositories are potential workarounds.
*   The fix involves improvements in path validation and lstat caching, ensuring that directory removals properly reset the cache.

In summary, CVE-2021-21300 is a critical vulnerability that allows for arbitrary code execution via a maliciously crafted Git repository, exploiting a race condition in how Git handles symbolic links and filter operations in conjunction with a case insensitive filesystem.
