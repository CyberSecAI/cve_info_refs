Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21382:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control in the `restund` TURN server, which allows relaying traffic to loopback addresses. This bypasses the intended security mechanism that should prevent connections to local services. Specifically, the vulnerability arises because `restund` did not properly block connections to loopback addresses (127.0.0.1, ::1), 'any' addresses (0.0.0.0, ::), link local addresses (169.254.0.0/16, fe80::/10) and broadcast address (255.255.255.255).

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The TURN server failed to properly validate the peer address specified in the `XOR-PEER-ADDRESS` field of the CONNECT request, allowing the use of loopback, 'any', link-local and broadcast addresses.
    *   **Missing Default Restrictions:**  The default configuration lacked restrictions on relaying traffic to loopback, 'any', link-local, and broadcast addresses, which are typically considered unsafe for external connections.

*  **Impact:**
    *   **Access to Internal Services:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to relay traffic to services running on the same machine as the TURN server. This bypasses firewall rules and potentially exposes sensitive services that are meant to be private. This includes access to the `status` interface of `restund` which is enabled by default and listens on `127.0.0.1`.  An attacker can issue administrative commands to `restund` by setting `XOR-PEER-ADDRESS` to `127.0.0.1:{{restund_udp_status_port}}`.
    *  **Abuse of TURN Server**: An attacker could use the vulnerable TURN server as a proxy to reach internal services, potentially escalating attacks within the network.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker sends a `CONNECT` request to the vulnerable TURN server.
    *   The attacker sets the `XOR-PEER-ADDRESS` in the `CONNECT` request to a loopback address (e.g., `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`), an 'any' address (e.g. `0.0.0.0`, `[::]`), a link-local address (e.g., `169.254.0.1`, `fe80::1`), or a broadcast address (e.g. `255.255.255.255`).
    *   The TURN server incorrectly establishes a relay to the specified address.
    *   The attacker uses this relay to access other services on the TURN server's host.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable TURN server and the ability to send TURN requests.
    *   No special privileges are required on the TURN server.
    *   The attacker needs knowledge about the internal services they intend to target.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue is similar to the bypass of coturn's access control, described in CVE-2020-26262.
*   The vulnerability is present in `restund` versions prior to 0.4.15.
*   The fix involves explicitly disallowing relaying to loopback, 'any', link local, and broadcast addresses.
*   Mitigation steps include:
    *   Upgrading to `restund` version 0.4.15 or later.
    *   Disabling the `status` module in `restund`.
    *   Disabling the `turn` module if it is not needed.
    *   Implementing firewall rules to restrict the addresses to which the TURN server can relay traffic.
