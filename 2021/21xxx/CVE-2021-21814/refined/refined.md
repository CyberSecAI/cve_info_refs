Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-21814:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `HandleFileArg` function of AT&T Labs' Xmill utility when compiled for Windows. Specifically, after a `memcpy` is used to copy a file path into a buffer on the stack, a null terminator is written at an offset calculated using the length of the user-controlled input path. If the length of the input path is larger than the buffer, the null byte write occurs out of bounds. This occurs even if the `memcpy` operation was fixed to prevent overflow, due to incorrect assumptions about buffer size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:**  The code writes a null byte at an address outside the intended buffer on the stack. This is due to calculating the offset based on `strlen` of the user provided input without verifying it's within bounds of the `fullpath` buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** By carefully crafting the input, an attacker could potentially overwrite critical data on the stack, including return addresses, and achieve arbitrary code execution.
*   **Crash:**  As shown in the crash information, a controlled crash is also possible as the program will write to invalid memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Command-line argument:** The attacker provides a specially crafted file path argument to the Xmill executable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the vulnerable Xmill binary on a system with a vulnerable version installed, and pass in a crafted command line argument.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** An attacker would need to know the format of the input required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is in the `HandleFileArg` function within the `xmill.exe` executable.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the input path contains directory separators ('\' or '/').
*   The `memcpy` is used to copy the path into a 400-byte buffer (`fullpath`).
*   The null byte out-of-bounds write occurs at `fullpath[ptr-filepattern+1] = 0;`

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability exists in the Windows version of Xmill.
*   The same code base for Xmill is also present within Schneider Electricâ€™s EcoStruxure Control Expert, making that product vulnerable as well.
*   This report indicates that the `memcpy` overflow can be fixed but that the null byte out of bounds write will still exist.
