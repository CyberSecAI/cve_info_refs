**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not require any privileges to perform the attack (PR:N).
- The attacker needs to trick the victim to click on the malicious link, requiring user interaction (UI:R).
- The attacker can be located remotely (no need for local access).

**Affected product and versions:**
- Dell EMC iDRAC9 versions before 4.40.40.00.

**Remediation:**
- Update to version 4.40.40.00 or later.
