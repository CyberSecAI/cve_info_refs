Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21865:

**Summary:**

The provided documents confirm that CVE-2021-21865 is a vulnerability related to unsafe deserialization in the CODESYS Development System, similar to CVE-2021-21864. However, this vulnerability affects the deserialization of CODESYS project and repository files as well as CODESYS SVN project artifacts, not local configuration files as described in CVE-2021-21864.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the unsafe deserialization of untrusted data within the CODESYS Development System, specifically when parsing parts of CODESYS project and repository files, and also when CODESYS SVN parses project artifacts received from SVN repositories. The system uses `BinaryFormatter.Deserialize` (in the case of CVE-2021-21864) and similar deserialization functions (in the case of CVE-2021-21865) without properly validating the data, which allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unsafe Deserialization:** The primary weakness is the usage of deserialization functions on untrusted data, which allows for arbitrary code execution by crafting malicious serialized objects.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The system fails to sufficiently verify the data being deserialized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution by injecting malicious serialized objects through crafted project files, repository files, or SVN project artifacts.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Malformed data could crash the application, causing a denial of service.
*   **Information Disclosure:** In some cases, information could be disclosed by crafting specific serialized objects.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious CODESYS Project/Archive Files:** An attacker could create a malicious CODESYS project or archive file and trick a user into opening it.
*  **Malicious Packages:** Installing malicious packages with the CODESYS package manager can modify affected files.
*   **Compromised SVN Repositories:** An attacker could host malicious CODESYS project artifacts on a compromised SVN repository. When a user accesses this repository with CODESYS SVN, the malicious data will be deserialized and execute code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious file to the user (e.g. project file, archive file, or malicious package) or host malicious data on an SVN repository.
*   The user needs to open the malicious file with the vulnerable software or connect to the malicious SVN server.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges on the system.

**Additional details from the provided documents:**

*   The vulnerability affects both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the CODESYS Development System.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "high" with a CVSS v3.0 base score of 8.8
*   Publicly available Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) exist.
*   The vendor has released software updates to address the vulnerability.

**In Summary:** The document provides details that the vulnerability exists due to unsafe deserialization of project files. The provided data matches the description of CVE-2021-21865 which involves the unsafe deserialization of parts of project and repository files and SVN project artifacts, that could lead to remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.
