The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21823.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the "Friend finder" functionality within the Komoot application that allows substring matching when searching for users. This substring matching leads to unintended disclosure of email addresses and profile IDs. Also, deleted accounts profile pictures are not removed from the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Information Disclosure:** The application discloses user email addresses via substring matching in the friend finder feature. It also discloses profile IDs by enabling enumeration through the substring search functionality.
2.  **Privacy Violation:** The ability to enumerate user profile IDs and expose their email addresses even when the user has not specifically shared them is a privacy violation.
3. **Data Retention:** The profile pictures of deleted accounts are not removed, potentially leading to privacy concerns

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can:
1.  Enumerate a large number of email addresses and profile IDs.
2. Identify users registered under specific domains.
3.  Potentially target users working for specific companies.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack is carried out via network requests to the friend finder functionality of the Komoot application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs:
1.  To be able to send network requests to the Komoot server.
2.  To have access to the Komoot application's friend finder feature. No special privileges are required to perform the attack.
