- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Jenkins REST API for checking where a fingerprint was used by which builds does not properly validate the provided fingerprint ID before checking for its XML metadata.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation, specifically for the fingerprint ID. This allows for arbitrary file existence checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers with Overall/Read permission can check for the existence of arbitrary XML files on the controller file system by providing a relative path constructed from a 32-character string as fingerprint ID. This could reveal information about the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted request to the fingerprint REST API endpoint with a maliciously crafted fingerprint ID.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have Overall/Read permission.
