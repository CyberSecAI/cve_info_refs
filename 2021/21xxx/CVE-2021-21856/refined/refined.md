The provided content is a detailed vulnerability report from Talos, covering multiple CVEs, including CVE-2021-21856.

**CVE-2021-21856**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** An integer overflow occurs when parsing the "svhd" atom in the GPAC library, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
    *   The code reads a 64-bit atom size, adds 1 to it, and then truncates the result to 32 bits before passing it to `gf_malloc`. If the original 64-bit size is sufficiently large, the addition followed by the truncation leads to a zero-sized memory allocation.
    *   After the allocation, the code uses the original, non-truncated 64-bit size to read data into the undersized buffer, causing a heap-based buffer overflow.
    *   A null-termination is written outside the allocated buffer.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** The heap-based buffer overflow can lead to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution under the context of the library.
*   **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted MPEG-4 file is required. The attacker needs to convince the victim to open this malicious video file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious MPEG-4 file. The attacker needs to trick a user into opening the crafted file using a vulnerable version of the GPAC library.

The report provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes the vulnerable code snippets, explanations of the vulnerability, crash information, and a detailed description of the parsing process.
