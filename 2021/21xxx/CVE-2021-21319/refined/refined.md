Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21319:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before it's stored and displayed in various parts of the Galette application. Specifically:
*   Dynamic field configuration: User-provided names for dynamic fields were not properly sanitized before being stored in the database.
*   Self-subscription page: Malicious JavaScript could be embedded within data submitted through self-subscription and then displayed to other users.
*   Login and password retrieval pages: User inputs on login and password retrieval pages were not sanitized, allowing for potential JavaScript injection (execution, not storage).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious scripts were stored in the database through dynamic field configuration and self-subscription form. These scripts could then be executed when the data was retrieved and displayed.
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** On login and password retrieval pages, unsanitized inputs led to JavaScript execution in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the application. This could lead to:
    *   **Data theft:** Stealing user session cookies or other sensitive information.
    *   **Account takeover:** Manipulating the user interface to trick users into providing their credentials or performing actions they did not intend.
    *   **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   **Defacement:** Changing content of the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Dynamic Field Configuration:** An authenticated administrator can inject malicious JavaScript code through the dynamic field configuration interface.
*   **Self-Subscription:** Unauthenticated users (or anyone with access to the self-subscription page) can inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Login/Password Retrieval Pages:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript through the login form input or password retrieval input field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Dynamic Field Configuration:** Requires administrative access to configure dynamic fields.
*   **Self-Subscription:** Does not require authentication; accessible to any user (potentially anonymously).
*   **Login/Password Retrieval Pages:** No prior authentication required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involves sanitizing user inputs using `strip_tags()` and `htmlspecialchars()` functions before storing or displaying data.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Galette version 0.9.5.
*   The commit logs show the use of `strip_tags()` and `htmlspecialchars()` to sanitize the input in the following files:
