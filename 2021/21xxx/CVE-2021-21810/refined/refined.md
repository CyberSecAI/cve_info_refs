- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap buffer overflow occurs in the `ParseAttribs` function of AT&T Labs' Xmill XML parser when processing a crafted XML file. This happens because the `curblock` pointer is set to NULL due to a mismatch in start and end labels. Then, when parsing attributes without an `=` sign, the `AddLabel` function attempts to write to memory pointed to by `curlabel`, which, due to `curblock` being NULL, becomes an out-of-bounds write, leading to heap corruption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary heap memory can be overwritten, leading to potential denial-of-service or potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can provide a specially crafted malicious XML file to be parsed by Xmill.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious XML file to a vulnerable application.
