Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-21630:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Extra Columns Plugin does not properly sanitize parameter values before displaying them in the build parameters column.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of output escaping of parameter values.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into parameter values, which will then be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the build parameters column. This could lead to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to have Job/Configure permission to modify job configurations and insert malicious scripts into parameter values.
- A view containing such a job also needs to be configured with the build parameters column, or the attacker needs View/Configure permission on the affected view.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have Job/Configure permission to modify the configuration of a job.
- The attacker may need View/Configure permissions if the view is not already configured to display the vulnerable column.

**Additional details:**

The vulnerability is present in Extra Columns Plugin version 1.22 and earlier. Version 1.23 fixes this vulnerability by escaping the parameter values. The vulnerability is identified as SECURITY-2222 within the Jenkins security advisory.
