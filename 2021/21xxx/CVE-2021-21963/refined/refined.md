- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SeaConnect 370W web server uses HTTP Basic Authentication without TLS encryption, sending username and password in Base64 encoded format within the `Authentication` header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing encryption of sensitive data (CWE-311). The use of HTTP Basic Auth without TLS/SSL allows for credential interception.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept and extract the Base64 encoded username and password, which can then be decoded, leading to disclosure of sensitive information such as device configurations.
- **Attack vectors**: Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack by sniffing network traffic between a user and the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be positioned in the network path between the user and the SeaConnect 370W device to capture network traffic.
