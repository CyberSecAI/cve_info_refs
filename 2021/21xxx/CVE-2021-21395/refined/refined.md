Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21395:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The password reset functionality is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This vulnerability occurs in the time between when a user clicks the password reset link and when they submit their new password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper CSRF protection during the password reset process. Specifically, the period between initiating the password reset and actually submitting the new password is not protected from CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially change a user's password without their knowledge if they trick the user into clicking on a malicious link during the vulnerable time window after a password reset has been initiated. This could lead to account compromise and unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Link:** An attacker can trick a user into clicking a malicious link or performing some other action that triggers the password reset process for them. The critical point is that the attack must happen during the time window between when the password reset link is clicked and the new password form submission.
*   **CSRF Exploitation:** The attacker leverages the lack of CSRF protection to force the victim's browser to make a password change request without the user's explicit consent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to socially engineer the victim to initiate the password reset process.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to exploit the CSRF vulnerability within the timeframe between the user initiating the reset and submitting the new password.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is classified as **Low severity.**
* The vulnerability affects versions <= 19.4.21 and <= 20.0.18 of the `openmage/magento-lts` package.
* There are no available patches or workarounds at the time of writing, but the provided information states that a Pull Request (PR) is forthcoming.
