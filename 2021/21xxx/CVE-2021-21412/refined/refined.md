Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21412:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the usage of `execSync` in the `@thi.ng/egf` package when handling `#gpg`-tagged values. Specifically, the encrypted content was passed directly to the shell via command interpolation using backticks, which enabled arbitrary code execution if the encrypted value contained backticks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The vulnerability is a command injection vulnerability because the input to the `gpg` command is constructed using string interpolation, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution on the server or machine running the affected code, with the privileges of the process. This could lead to data theft, system compromise, or other malicious activity.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to control the content of the `#gpg` tagged value within an EGF file or string processed by `@thi.ng/egf`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious EGF file or string containing a specially crafted `#gpg` tag that includes backticks. The attacker needs to have control of the data being parsed.
- The application must have enabled the `decrypt: true` option, to process the GPG-encrypted values.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions `<=0.3.21` of the `@thi.ng/egf` package.
- The fix was implemented by using `execFileSync` and passing the encrypted content via the `input` parameter instead of string interpolation in the shell command. This avoids the shell expansion and removes the command injection vulnerability. The fix was released in version 0.4.0.
- The vulnerability is only exploitable if the `decrypt` option is enabled in the EGF parser, as this triggers the GPG decryption process.
