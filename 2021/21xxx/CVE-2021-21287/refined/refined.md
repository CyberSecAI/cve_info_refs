Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `LoginSTS` function in `web-handlers.go`. This function, designed to handle Security Token Service (STS) user logins using a provided JWT token, was making a network request using the token before validating it. This allowed a crafted request to potentially reach internal services without proper authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary vulnerability is SSRF. By crafting a malicious request with a tampered JWT token, an attacker could make the server send requests to arbitrary internal or external URLs.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code was not validating the incoming JWT token before using it to make a network request.
- **Incorrect Proxying:** The server was incorrectly proxying the request before authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Access to Internal Resources:** Attackers could potentially read or update internal resources by manipulating the URLs.
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** This could include reading server configuration such as AWS metadata, connecting to internal services like HTTP enabled databases, or performing POST requests towards internal services not intended to be exposed.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Exploiting SSRF can sometimes lead to other forms of attacks depending on the exposed resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `LoginSTS` API endpoint that accepts a JWT token.
- An attacker crafts a malicious request containing a manipulated JWT token.
- The server, without proper validation, uses this token to make a request to a potentially malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the `LoginSTS` API endpoint.
- The attacker needs to have some understanding of the expected JWT format to be able to craft a request that bypasses initial checks and triggers the SSRF.
- They need to be able to craft a URL that exploits the lack of validation.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was fixed in release `RELEASE.2021-01-30T00-20-58Z` by implementing inline validation of the JWT token before making the network request.
* A workaround is to disable the browser front-end with the `MINIO_BROWSER=off` environment variable.
* The vulnerability was discovered through a code review by a community member.
* The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2021-21287.
