Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28677:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an inefficient readline implementation used when processing EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) image files. This implementation uses a quadratic method for accumulating lines while searching for line endings, which are expected to be a combination of `\r` and `\n`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Quadratic Time Complexity:** The core weakness is the use of a quadratic time complexity algorithm in the readline function used by `EPSImageFile`, which is triggered when parsing EPS files. This leads to a significant increase in processing time as the number of lines increases.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious EPS file with a large number of lines, and specific line endings can trigger the inefficient readline function and cause a denial-of-service. This DoS occurs during the `open` phase of processing the image file.
- **Resource Consumption:** By exploiting the quadratic complexity of the algorithm, an attacker can cause excessive CPU consumption, making the vulnerable application or service unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious EPS File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted EPS file designed to exploit the quadratic nature of the readline implementation.
- **File Upload/Processing:** The attacker needs to be able to submit this malicious EPS file to a vulnerable system which uses Pillow library to process images.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to provide a crafted EPS file to a system using a vulnerable version of Pillow.
- The attacker does not need any privileges to carry out the attack.
- No user interaction is needed.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability exists in Pillow versions prior to 8.2.0 and dates back to the PIL fork.
- The vulnerability can be triggered before the image is accepted for opening, making it easier for an attacker to cause the denial of service.
- The fix involves correcting the EPS readline implementation to be more efficient.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- The vulnerability has a high CVSS severity rating (8.7)
