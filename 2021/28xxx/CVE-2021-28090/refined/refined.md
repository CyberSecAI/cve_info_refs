Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-28090:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the use of `strstr()` in the `dirvote_add_signatures_to_pending_consensus()` function, where `find_str_at_start_of_line()` should have been used instead.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect usage of the `strstr()` function, which allows for matching substrings anywhere within a line, instead of just at the beginning of a line.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by preventing consensus generation and crashing directory authorities. This is achieved by naming a relay "directory-signature".

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves manipulating relay nicknames.
- Specifically, an attacker needs to name their relay "directory-signature".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to register a Tor relay with a chosen nickname.
- This vulnerability specifically targets directory authorities.
