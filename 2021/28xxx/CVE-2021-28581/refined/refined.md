- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled search path element.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application searches for resources in locations not entirely controlled by the application, potentially allowing an attacker to place malicious files in the search path.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user, leading to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit the uncontrolled search path by placing a malicious executable or library file in a directory that the application searches before the intended one. When the application attempts to load a required resource, it would instead load the attacker's malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to write to a location in the search path used by the application. The attacker must be able to place malicious files in a location that is searched before the legitimate file by the vulnerable application.
