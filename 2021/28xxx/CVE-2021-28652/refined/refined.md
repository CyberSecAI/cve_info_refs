Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28652:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect parser validation within the Squid Cache Manager API. Specifically, the `CacheManager::ParseUrl()` function uses `sscanf` to parse the URL and then passes the extracted parameters to `Mgr::QueryParams::Parse()`. The parsing logic within `Mgr::QueryParams::Parse()` can lead to an exception due to an invalid substring operation when processing a specific malformed URL containing a single "&" parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak**: The incorrect parsing of the Cache Manager API can lead to memory leaks when a specific malformed URL is provided by a privileged client.
- **Denial of Service**: Over time, these memory leaks can result in a denial-of-service condition.
- **Incorrect Input Validation**: The root cause is the lack of proper validation in the `Mgr::QueryParams::Parse()` function. Specifically, the code attempts to extract substrings based on the position of the '&' character, but doesn't handle cases where the string is just '&'.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: A successful exploit leads to a DoS, potentially crashing the Squid proxy or making it unavailable.
- **Resource Exhaustion**: The memory leaks eventually consume available system resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based**: An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the Squid proxy containing a malicious URL targeting the Cache Manager API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Trusted Client**: The attacker needs to be a "trusted client" with access to the Cache Manager API.
- **Network Access**: The attacker must have network connectivity to the Squid proxy server.
- **Privileged Access**: The client needs to have the privilege to access the Cache Manager API.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered in the `Mgr::QueryParams::Parse()` function when a malformed URL like `cache_object://0/io?&` is processed.
- The `sscanf` function parses the URL, and then the `params` variable contains a single character '&'.
- The vulnerability occurs in the `for` loop inside the function:
```c++
for (size_t i = n; i < len; ++i) {
    if (aParamsStr[i] == '&') {
        if (!ParseParam(aParamsStr.substr(n, i), param))
```
   When `n` and `i` are both zero, `aParamsStr.substr(n, i)` results in a `String::substr` exception.
- The issue was fixed by using a pre-parsed and validated representation available at HttpRequest::url instead of parsing the full URI again.

**CVE Severity:**
- The vulnerability is classified as moderate with a CVSS score of 7.8 (or 6.8 based on the github advisory).

**Affected Versions:**
- Squid versions 1.0-4.14 and 5.0-5.0.5 are affected.
- Squid versions prior to 3.5.28 may also be affected.

**Patched Versions:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in Squid versions 4.15 and 5.0.6.

**Workarounds:**
- Disable Cache Manager access entirely by adding `http_access deny manager` to the Squid configuration.
- Harden Cache Manager access privileges by requiring authentication or other access controls beyond the default IP address restrictions.
