{
  "CVE-2021-28139": {
    "Root cause": "Lack of out-of-bounds check in ESP32 BT library when handling LMP_feature_response_ext packets.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper bounds check"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution on ESP32 devices. Attackers can overwrite callback pointers stored out of bounds in memory, potentially leading to full control over the device. Erasing NVRAM, disabling Bluetooth/Wi-Fi, and controlling GPIO are possible.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted LMP_feature_res_ext packet with an invalid feature page (0x62) during the BT connection process.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be in radio range and know the target's Bluetooth device address. No prior pairing or authentication is required."
