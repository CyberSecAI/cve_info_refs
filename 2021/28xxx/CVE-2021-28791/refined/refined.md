Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28791:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the fact that the "SwiftFormat for VS Code" extension allowed certain configurations, specifically `swiftformat.path`, to be overridden by workspace configurations. This override capability allowed an attacker to point to an arbitrary executable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The extension lacks proper access control by allowing workspace settings to override critical configurations like the path to the SwiftFormat executable.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By crafting a malicious workspace configuration, an attacker can force the extension to execute arbitrary binaries on the victim's machine. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Crafted workspace configuration:** The attacker needs to create a workspace with a malicious configuration file that overrides the `swiftformat.path` setting.
*   **Victim opens the crafted workspace:** The victim must then open this crafted workspace using VS Code with the vulnerable SwiftFormat extension.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious workspace configuration file.
*   The attacker needs to convince the victim to open the malicious workspace with the vulnerable version of the SwiftFormat extension installed.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.3.7 by banning the override of vulnerable configurations in workspaces.
* The vulnerability was reported by @Ry0taK.
