{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'email' field when updating an admin's profile. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's database.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Lack of input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the affected web application. This can lead to various malicious outcomes, including stealing sensitive user data (e.g., session cookies, credentials), redirecting users to malicious sites, defacing websites, or performing actions on behalf of users.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is a web request to the admin profile update functionality that contains a malicious JavaScript payload in the 'email' field.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be an authenticated user to access the admin profile update functionality and inject the malicious payload."
