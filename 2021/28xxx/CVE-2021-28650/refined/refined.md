  "CVE-2021-28650": {
    "description": "gnome-autoar before 0.3.1 allows Directory Traversal during extraction because it lacks a check of whether a file's parent is a symlink in certain complex situations. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-36241.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-36241. The vulnerability occurs because `autoar-extractor.c` in `gnome-autoar` does not properly check if a file's parent directory is a symbolic link pointing outside the intended extraction location, specifically in complex situations.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Directory Traversal: By crafting a malicious archive with symbolic links, a user can be tricked into extracting files outside the intended destination.",
      "Incomplete fix from CVE-2020-36241: The initial fix for CVE-2020-36241 was insufficient and did not cover all scenarios of symlink directory traversal."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted archive using GNOME Autoar, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious archive: An attacker crafts a malicious archive containing symbolic links designed to point outside of the intended extraction directory.",
        "User interaction: The user needs to open the malicious archive with gnome-autoar."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious archive file and get the user to extract it via gnome-autoar.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability arises because the `autoar_extractor_do_sanitize_pathname` function does not correctly handle symlinks in parent directories. The function also doesn't handle cases where `GFile` objects created from `archive_entry_pathname` contain '..' segments which could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities. Hardlinks are also a potential attack vector, as they are not properly sanitized."
