Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2021-28379:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `UploadHandler.php` file where the origin check implemented to prevent Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) bypasses is flawed. The code attempts to validate the `HTTP_ORIGIN` header against an `expected_http_origin`, which is constructed using the server's hostname and port.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability arises because the origin check is not robust enough. It relies on the value of the `HTTP_ORIGIN` header which can be easily manipulated. Additionally, the method of constructing the `expected_http_origin` using `hostname` and `SERVER_PORT` may be vulnerable to hostname and port spoofing on some server configurations.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can bypass the origin check by sending a malicious `HTTP_ORIGIN` header, which can lead to unauthorized access to resources and potentially, the ability to upload malicious files or exploit other vulnerabilities if they exist on the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP request with a malicious `HTTP_ORIGIN` header.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They do not need to be on the same network as the server and there's no indication of other requirements such as authentication.

**Technical Details:**
The relevant code snippet from `UploadHandler.php` is:
```php
$hostname = exec('hostname');
$port = $_SERVER['SERVER_PORT'];
$expected_http_origin="https://".$hostname.":".$port;
if ($_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN'] != $expected_http_origin) {
  die ("Nope.");
}
```
This code retrieves the server's hostname using the `hostname` command, the port using the `SERVER_PORT` environment variable, and constructs an expected origin string. Then it checks if the `HTTP_ORIGIN` header matches this expected origin.

This check is vulnerable because:
1.  `HTTP_ORIGIN` header can be forged by the attacker
2.  `hostname` command and `SERVER_PORT` can be influenced by certain server configurations, leading to an incorrect `expected_http_origin`.

The commit `3402071` shows the addition of this vulnerable code.
