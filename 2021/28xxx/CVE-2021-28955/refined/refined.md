Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28955:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how the `git-bug` application searches for the `git` binary. On some operating systems like Windows, the current directory is included in the default search path with higher precedence than the system-wide path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427):** The application does not explicitly control the search path when looking for the `git` executable, making it vulnerable to path hijacking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A malicious user can craft a fake `git` executable (e.g., `git.bat` on Windows), commit it to a repository, and push it. When `git-bug` is used within that repository, the malicious `git` executable may be found and executed instead of the legitimate one.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Malicious Repository:** An attacker creates or modifies a repository to include a malicious `git` executable.
* **User Interaction:** A user clones the malicious repository and uses the vulnerable `git-bug` application within that repository.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Repository Access:** The attacker needs the ability to modify the contents of a repository that will be used with the vulnerable application. This can be either public repository or a private repository they have write access to.

**Additional Information:**

* The vulnerability affects versions of `git-bug` prior to 0.7.2.
* The fix for this vulnerability is implemented in version 0.7.2 of `git-bug`.
* The issue is more likely to occur on operating systems like Windows or other OSes with a badly configured PATH.
* The vulnerability is a result of a recently addressed issue in the Go language, specifically how binaries are located before being executed.
