{
  "RELATED": true,
  "CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-28170",
  "ROOT_CAUSE": "A bug in the `ELParserTokenManager` allows invalid EL expressions to be evaluated as if they were valid. Specifically, the parser consumes a backslash as part of the literal expression and leaves the character following it unescaped.",
  "WEAKNESSES": [
    "Improper Input Sanitization",
     "Incorrect EL expression tokenization"
  ],
  "IMPACT": "Allows attackers to bypass input sanitization controls (escaping, stripping) that developers may have put in place when handling user-controlled data in error messages potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in affected applications.",
  "ATTACK_VECTORS": [
    "By injecting specially crafted EL expressions within user-controlled data, such as in Bean Validation constraint error messages, the attacker can bypass sanitization controls and execute arbitrary code or leak sensitive data."
  ],
    "REQUIRED_CAPABILITIES": "An attacker needs to be able to inject user controlled data, like an error message, that will be processed by the vulnerable EL implementation"
}
