Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `m1_sortby` POST parameter within the News module of CMS Made Simple. Specifically, the application replaces single quotes (`'`) with underscores (`_`) but does not prevent other forms of SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the unsanitized input being directly incorporated into an SQL query.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The sanitization logic only replaces single quotes, which is not sufficient to prevent SQL injection attacks using other SQL syntax.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database, potentially leading to:
  - Data exfiltration
  - Data modification or deletion
  - Privilege escalation
  - Complete compromise of the CMS and underlying server.
- In the provided example, the attacker was able to inject a time-based payload to confirm SQL injection.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exposed through the `m1_sortby` POST parameter, accessible via `moduleinterface.php` page.
- This vulnerability can be triggered remotely, although it requires prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the CMS.
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to `moduleinterface.php` with a crafted `m1_sortby` parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `modules/News/function.admin_articlestab.php`.
- The `sortby` parameter is concatenated directly into an SQL query, which allows for injection of arbitrary SQL language without the need for single quotes.
- The vendor was informed about the vulnerability but declined to fix it.
