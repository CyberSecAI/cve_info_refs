Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28128:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper verification when a user changes their password in the Strapi administration panel. Specifically, the system allows a user to change their password without requiring the entry of their current password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-620 (Unverified Password Change):**  The primary weakness is the absence of a check to verify the user's identity before allowing a password change. This lack of verification allows an attacker to change the password of a user if they have access to their session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Hijacking:** An attacker who has gained access to a valid user session can change the account password. This allows the attacker to completely take control of the user's account, potentially gaining access to sensitive information, and manipulating content on the CMS, leading to a complete compromise of the account's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Session Hijacking:** The attack vector requires the attacker to first gain access to an active, valid user session on the Strapi administration panel. This could be achieved through various methods such as:
    - **Session Stealing:** By intercepting session cookies or tokens.
    - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If XSS vulnerabilities are present, they could be leveraged to steal session information.
    - **Physical Access:** If the attacker gains physical access to a logged-in machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to a Valid User Session:** The attacker must have access to an authenticated user's session. This requires compromising the user session beforehand.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Strapi administration panel to perform the password change.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered to have a medium risk level.
- The affected versions are Strapi CMS versions 3.6.0 and below.
- A fix was not yet available when the advisory was published.
- The advisory explicitly states that the user can change their password without entering their current password.
- The advisory also provides a basic Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor, but the vendor had not provided a fix by the public disclosure date (April 26, 2021).
