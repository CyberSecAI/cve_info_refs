Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28954:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an uncontrolled search path element issue (CWE-427). Specifically, the `bit` application on Windows was vulnerable to path hijacking when interacting with git.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Search Path:** The `bit` application did not properly validate the path used to execute git commands, allowing a malicious actor to place a fake `git.exe` in a location that would be searched first.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By replacing the legitimate `git.exe` with a malicious one, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the `bit` application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Repository:** The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into using `bit` to interact with a specially crafted repository containing a malicious executable named `git.exe`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to create a malicious repository that contains a crafted `git.exe` file, and have a user use the vulnerable `bit` application to interact with this repository.
*   The attacker is likely to be remote, and needs to get the user to clone/use the malicious repository.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability was present in versions of `bit` prior to 1.0.5, and was fixed in version 1.0.5.
*   The vulnerability only affects Windows systems.
