Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-28632:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: Use-After-Free (UAF).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The vulnerability is a Use-After-Free (CWE-416), meaning the software attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to potential memory corruption.
*  **Impact of Exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current user.
*   **Attack Vectors**: The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker would need to have local access to the machine, and user interaction is required (user needs to open the crafted document). The CVSS vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H` confirms this:
    *   `AV:L` (Attack Vector: Local)
    *   `AC:L` (Attack Complexity: Low)
    *   `PR:N` (Privileges Required: None)
    *   `UI:R` (User Interaction: Required)
    *   `S:U` (Scope: Unchanged)
    *   `C:H` (Confidentiality Impact: High)
    *   `I:H` (Integrity Impact: High)
    *   `A:H` (Availability Impact: High)
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: An attacker needs to have local access to the target machine and convince a user to open a malicious file (likely a PDF) to trigger the vulnerability.

The document indicates that this vulnerability affects multiple versions of Adobe Acrobat and Reader on both Windows and macOS. The document also lists the fixed versions. The vulnerability is considered Critical.
