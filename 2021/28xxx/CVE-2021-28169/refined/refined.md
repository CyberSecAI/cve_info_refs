{
  "CVE-2021-28169": {
    "Description": "Requests to the `ConcatServlet` and `WelcomeFilter` are able to access protected resources within the `WEB-INF` directory. This can reveal sensitive information regarding the implementation of a web application. This occurs because both `ConcatServlet` and `WelcomeFilter` decode the supplied path to verify it is not within the `WEB-INF` or `META-INF` directories. It then uses this decoded path to call `RequestDispatcher` which will also do decoding of the path. This double decoding allows paths with a doubly encoded `WEB-INF` to bypass this security check.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by double decoding of the URL path, in the `ConcatServlet` and `WelcomeFilter`, when checking if a resource resides within `WEB-INF` or `META-INF` directories.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information about the web application's implementation by accessing files in the WEB-INF directory.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the ConcatServlet or WelcomeFilter servlets using a specially crafted URL with double encoding. This allows attackers to bypass security checks and access protected resources.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a crafted URI to the targeted server hosting the vulnerable web application. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability."
