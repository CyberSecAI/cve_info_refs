{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of `File.createTempFile`, which generates files in the system's temporary directory with insecure permissions (`-rw-r--r--`). This allows other local users to read the contents of these temporary files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions (CWE-378)",
      "Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions (CWE-379)"
    ],
    "impact": "Local information disclosure. If sensitive data is written to these temporary files, it could be exposed to other users on the same system.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access to the system is required. An attacker needs to be a local user on the same system where the vulnerable application is running.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be a local user on the system, without any specific privileges needed. "

  "affected_component": {
    "name": "org.glassfish.jersey.core:jersey-common",

   "patches": {
        "versions": "2.34, 3.0.2",
        "details": "Jersey 2.34 and 3.0.2 forward sets the correct permissions on the temporary file created by Jersey."

  "workarounds": "Manually setting the `java.io.tmpdir` system property when launching the JVM can mitigate this issue."
