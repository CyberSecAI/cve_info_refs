- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `Intern<T>` type in the `internment` crate unconditionally implemented the `Sync` trait, even when the underlying type `T` did not implement `Sync`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: This allowed users to create data races on `T` when `T` is not `Sync`. Data races lead to undefined behavior.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The primary impact is undefined behavior, which can lead to memory corruption.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability is exploited by using the `Intern<T>` type with a type `T` that is not `Sync` in a multi-threaded context.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to control the type `T` that is used with `Intern<T>` and run code using the struct in a multi-threaded context to cause a data race.
