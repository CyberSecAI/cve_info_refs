```
Root cause of vulnerability: A malicious PV backend can cause a denial of service to guests by sending events at a high frequency. This is due to unhardened frontends in the guest.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper handling of high frequency events sent by PV backends to guests, resulting in a denial-of-service condition. Three backends are affected: blkfront, netfront, and hvc_xen (console).
Impact of exploitation: A malicious PV backend can cause guest denial of service due to the guest being busy servicing interrupts for extended periods. This can be done even if the backend is running in a less privileged environment.
Attack vectors: A malicious PV backend sends events at a high frequency to the guest.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to control a PV backend to exploit the vulnerability.
