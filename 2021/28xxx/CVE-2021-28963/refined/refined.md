Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The Shibboleth Service Provider (SP) software's template engine, used for rendering error and status pages, was extended to allow replacement of placeholders with values from query parameters in URLs. This functionality, while not a typical need, allows external parameters to override internally supplied values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Template Injection via Query Parameters:** The core vulnerability lies in the ability to manipulate template placeholders using query parameters in URLs.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** While the values are encoded to prevent script injection, they are not adequately sanitized to prevent other forms of manipulation.
*  **Trust of Server Content:** The manipulated content appears to originate from the server, making it seem trustworthy to users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can manipulate displayed content to conduct phishing attacks. They can modify elements like email addresses, logos, style sheets, and support URLs to deceive users into providing sensitive information or taking malicious actions.
*   **Brand Spoofing:** By manipulating logos and styles, attackers can impersonate a legitimate service, further enhancing the effectiveness of phishing attempts.
*  **Potential for other forms of deception:** Although the text mainly discusses phishing, the ability to manipulate the rendered content could be used for other types of attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** The attack vector is the manipulation of URL query parameters. An attacker would craft URLs with specific query parameters to inject malicious content into the error or status pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to craft URLs:** Attackers need the ability to craft URLs containing specific query parameters that correspond to template placeholders.
*   **No privileged access required:** This attack does not require any special access to the server, and can be done remotely via the user's browser.
*  **Knowledge of Template Placeholders:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of the template placeholders used by the SP.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.2.1 or later of the Shibboleth SP software. The fix includes a configuration setting called `externalParameters` which, when set to `false` (the default), disables the vulnerable behavior. This provides a way to mitigate the issue for those who cannot upgrade immediately by statically setting the value of the vulnerable placeholders.
*  **Credits:** Toni Huttunen, Fraktal Oy is credited with discovering the vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation:** If upgrading is not possible, reducing or eliminating sensitive template replacement values with static values may decrease the impact.
*   **Affected Systems:** All platforms using affected versions of the Shibboleth SP are vulnerable.

This vulnerability could be considered a form of Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), though it's not a typical SSTI vulnerability that leads to remote code execution. Instead it results in phishing through manipulated content displayed by the server.
