Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-28675:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `PsdImagePlugin.PsdImageFile` in Pillow.
- The code did not properly check the number of input layers against the size of the data block within PSD files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input validation on the number of layers.
- Inadequate sanity checks on data block size relative to the number of layers.
- This leads to a potential denial-of-service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious PSD file can trigger a denial-of-service (DoS).
- The DoS occurs during the `open()` phase of image processing, before the image is fully loaded using `load()`.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious PSD image file.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the crafted image is opened using Pillow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious PSD file to an application that uses the vulnerable version of Pillow.
- No special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability, only access to process the crafted image file.
