The provided content is a security advisory for Froala Editor version 3.2.6, which is related to CVE-2021-28114.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in Froala Editor's HTML sanitization parsing. Specifically, the parser becomes confused when processing a combination of HTML and MathML tags, leading to a context switch that bypasses XSS protections.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper HTML sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the application using Froala. This can be used to control the user experience, force actions on behalf of users (e.g., bank transfers), escalate privileges, or exfiltrate sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors**: The XSS can be triggered by inserting a crafted JavaScript payload within specific HTML and MathML tags through the editor's Code View functionality or via the API using `$().html.set('[PAYLOAD]')`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to insert the malicious payload into the Froala Editor, either directly through the editor's interface or through the application's API. The ability to control content within the editor is a prerequisite. The attacker can be remote, but the impact is dependent on the context of the application leveraging Froala.

The advisory provides more details than the basic CVE description, explaining the technical details of the vulnerability, providing a sample payload and demonstrating the HTML parsing process that leads to the XSS. It also includes information about the vendor, affected version, mitigation and a detailed timeline of the disclosure process.
