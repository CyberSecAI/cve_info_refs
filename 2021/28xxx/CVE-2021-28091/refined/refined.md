Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-28091

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper verification of cryptographic signatures in SAML responses within the `lasso` library. Specifically, when processing unsigned SAML responses containing multiple assertions, the library would only check the signature of the first signed assertion and accept subsequent assertions without proper validation. This allows an attacker to manipulate the response and potentially control the main assertion used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML Signature Wrapping:** The core issue is that the library fails to validate all signatures within a SAML response, specifically in cases with unsigned responses containing multiple assertions.
- **Improper Signature Validation:** The vulnerability arises because the code only validates the first signed assertion, subsequent assertions, even if signed by a different issuer, are accepted without verification. This breaks the trust model inherent in signed SAML messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Impersonation:** An attacker can impersonate users by crafting a malicious SAML response.
- **Access Control Bypass:** By manipulating the SAML response, an attacker can bypass access controls, potentially gaining unauthorized access to protected resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulated SAML Response:** An attacker crafts a malicious SAML response containing multiple assertions, where only the first is legitimately signed, while others contain manipulated information. The targeted system processes the response believing it valid due to the initial valid signature.
- The attacker needs to be in a position to provide the manipulated SAML response to the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be capable of intercepting or generating SAML responses and sending them to a system using the vulnerable `lasso` library.
- The attacker also needs knowledge of SAML protocol to craft the malicious response.

**Additional Details from Content:**
- **Affected Software:** The `lasso` library, specifically versions prior to the fix.
- **Affected Distributions:** Fedora 33 & 34, Debian 9 (stretch) and 10 (buster)
- **Fix:** The fix involves ensuring that signatures of all assertions are checked when the SAML response is unsigned, and that messages with assertions from different issuers are rejected, even if signed.

This information is consistent with the general description of CVE-2021-28091, but it provides more technical detail and context, including specific code changes, affected versions, and how the vulnerability could be exploited.
