**Impact of Exploitation:**
Attackers can tamper with the cookie value to authenticate as any user without knowing their password. This allows complete account takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attacker would need to intercept or create a valid session cookie and then modify its values to impersonate other users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker would need the ability to interact with the web server and modify HTTP requests to manipulate the authentication cookie.
