The provided content is a security advisory for CVE-2021-28505, not CVE-2021-28504.

Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2021-28505:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an issue in how Arista EOS handles VXLAN match rules within IPv4 access lists (ACLs) applied to the ingress of L2 or L3 ports/SVIs. Specifically, when a VXLAN match rule is present, the system incorrectly ignores the IP protocol specified in that rule and subsequent rules within the same ACL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The core issue is that the access control mechanism, implemented via ACLs, fails to enforce the intended protocol filtering when VXLAN rules are involved.
*   **Incorrect Protocol Matching:** The system fails to match IP packets against the specified IP protocol in the ACL rules after a VXLAN rule.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing ACLs:**  An attacker could potentially bypass the intended access control policies by sending traffic with a protocol that should be blocked, but which is allowed due to the vulnerability.
*   **Unexpected Traffic Flows:**  The vulnerability can lead to unexpected traffic patterns, potentially allowing unauthorized traffic to pass through the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Traffic:** The attack vector is through sending network traffic that matches the conditions for this vulnerability, specifically traffic that would match a VXLAN rule in an affected access list.
*   **Ingress Ports/SVIs:** The vulnerability occurs at the ingress of L2 or L3 ports/SVIs where the affected ACL is applied.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send traffic to an affected device on a port or SVI where a vulnerable ACL is applied
*   **Knowledge of ACLs:**  The attacker would likely need to know how the affected access-list is configured to craft their attack, including the location of "permit/deny vxlan" rules within the access list.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory provides specific steps to check if a configuration is vulnerable, including commands to view the TCAM profile and access list configurations.
*   The advisory includes a workaround which involves replacing the "vxlan" match with a match on "udp" and the VXLAN destination port.
*   The fix involves upgrading to a specific software release that contains the patch.
