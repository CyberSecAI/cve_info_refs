- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is located in the code responsible for routing data written to standard error to the logger method. When encountering unicode data and the system/process locale is not set to UTF-8, the code enters an infinite loop trying to decode the data, instead of handling the decoding exception properly. This infinite loop results in high CPU utilization and excessive log file growth.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to an incorrect implementation of error handling when logging unicode data with non-UTF-8 locales, leading to an infinite loop during decoding.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation of the vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing high CPU usage and potentially filling up the disk with log data.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves sending a payload with unicode characters to StackStorm under conditions where the system locale is not configured for UTF-8.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send payloads with unicode characters to StackStorm.
