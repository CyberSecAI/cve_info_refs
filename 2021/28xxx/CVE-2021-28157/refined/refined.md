Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-28157:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- SQL injection vulnerability exists in the user deletion function of Devolutions Server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-provided input (specifically the username) before using it in an SQL query during the user deletion process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious SQL code via the username field, and have this code executed when an administrator attempts to delete the affected user, potentially leading to:
    - Data breaches: Unauthorized access to and manipulation of sensitive data within the database.
    - Data modification or deletion: An attacker might delete or modify tables.
    - Potential full control of the server, depending on the SQL user permissions.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack (remote exploitation).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative privileges within Devolutions Server to create/modify a user with malicious SQL code in the username field, and later delete it.
