- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software reads data from a memory location outside of the intended bounds.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary file system read, potentially leading to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vector isn't detailed, but it involves a specially crafted file or data that triggers the out-of-bounds read when processed by Adobe After Effects.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to provide a malicious file/data to a user who opens it with the vulnerable version of Adobe After Effects.
