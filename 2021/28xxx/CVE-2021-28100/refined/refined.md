{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Priam uses File.createTempFile which creates a temporary file with world-readable permissions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application creates temporary files with insecure default permissions, specifically world-readable (-rw-r--r--).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with read access to the local filesystem can read the contents of the temporary file, potentially leading to information disclosure.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to have read access to the local filesystem.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have local access to the filesystem where the Priam process creates temporary files."
