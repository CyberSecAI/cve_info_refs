- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap-based buffer overflow
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow leading to potential memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vector is not detailed, but the vulnerability is triggered when processing a malicious PDF file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to craft a malicious PDF file to trigger the heap-based buffer overflow. The user must then open the crafted PDF using a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat or Reader.
