Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-28710:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from an error in how Xen handles shared page tables between CPUs (for EPT) and IOMMUs. 
- Xen incorrectly skips stripping the top-level page table when an IOMMU requires fewer than 4 levels of page table depth. Specifically, the top level table should have been stripped before inserting the root table's address into the hardware pagetable base register.
- When page tables are shared, Xen fails to remove the top level.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect IOMMU Page Table Configuration:** Xen fails to properly configure IOMMU page tables when they are shared with CPUs and the IOMMU requires a shallower page table depth (less than 4 levels).
- **Direct Memory Access:** Due to the incorrect configuration, a guest OS can potentially write to lower-level page table entries that it should not have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A malicious guest can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges to that of the host system, potentially gaining full control of the hypervisor. This could lead to complete compromise of the host and other guests.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Guest OS:** The attacker must have control of a guest virtual machine running on the vulnerable Xen hypervisor.
- **PCI Passthrough:** The guest must be configured with PCI devices passed through to it, utilizing an IOMMU with shared page tables and requiring less than 4 levels of page table depth.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Guest Control:** The attacker needs the ability to execute code within a guest VM.
- **Specific Hardware:** The attacker must be operating on an Intel x86 system with a vulnerable IOMMU. The IOMMU should be configured to use shared page tables and to require less than 4 levels.
- **PCI Passthrough:** The guest needs to have a PCI device passed through to it and configured to share page tables for the IOMMU and EPT.
- **Technical Knowledge**: The attacker needs to have a deep understanding of IOMMUs, page tables and memory management in order to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Xen version 4.15. Versions 4.14 and earlier are not vulnerable.
-  The issue is specific to Intel x86 systems with IOMMUs. ARM systems, non-Intel x86 and x86 systems without IOMMU are not affected.
- The vulnerability is present when a guest is configured to share IOMMU and EPT page tables, which is a default configuration on capable hardware.
- Some older Intel chipsets (Ivybridge and earlier "client" chips) are known to require less than 4 levels of page table depth for IOMMUs.
- The vulnerability can also arise in nested virtualization scenarios where a hypervisor makes an emulated Intel IOMMU available to Xen.
- Mitigations include disabling shared page tables globally through the "iommu=no-sharept" hypervisor command-line parameter or on a per-guest basis via the "passthrough=sync_pt" option.
- A patch is available to fix this issue.
