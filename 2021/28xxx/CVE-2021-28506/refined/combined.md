### Description

This advisory documents the impact of several vulnerabilities related to OpenConfig transport protocols in Arista’s EOS software. Affected software releases are listed below.

**CVE-2021-28500, CVE-2021-28501** - An issue has recently been discovered where the incorrect use of EOS's AAA API’s by the OpenConfig and TerminAttr agents could result in unrestricted access to the device for local users with nopassword configuration.

**CVE-2021-28506** - Certain gNOI APIs incorrectly skip authorization and authentication which could potentially allow a factory reset of the device.

**CVE-2021-28507** - Under certain conditions, the service ACL configured for OpenConfig gNOI and OpenConfig RESTCONF might be bypassed, which results in the denied requests being forwarded to the agent.

**Acknowledgements**

Arista would like to acknowledge and thank Miles Sutcliffe @ <https://sutcliffe.it/> for responsibly reporting CVE-2021-28500
 CVE-2021-28501, CVE-2021-28506 and CVE-2021-28507 were found internally at Arista on Arista devices.

None of the vulnerabilities are known to be actively used maliciously in the field.

```

and a local user exists whose authentication is with nopassword.

```
username admin privilege 1 role network-admin nopassword
```

***Configuration vulnerable to CVE-2021-28501***

TerminAttr gNMI is enabled

```
daemon TerminAttr
   exec /usr/bin/TerminAttr ...
   no shutdown
```

and no password remote login authentication is disabled

```
no aaa authentication policy local allow-nopassword-remote-login
```

and a local user exists whose authentication is with nopassword.

```

***Configuration vulnerable to CVE-2021-28506***

OpenConfig gNMI/gNOI

```
management api gnmi
   transport grpc default
```

***Configuration vulnerable to CVE-2021-28507***

A service ACL is configured and

```
ip access-list standard oc-acl
   10 permit host 10.1.1.1
   20 permit host 172.16.1.1/24
   30 deny any
```

gNMI/gNOI is configured with service ACL, or

```
management api gnmi

      ip access-group oc-acl
```

RESTCONF configured with service ACL.

```
management api restconf
   transport https default
      ip access-group oc-acl
```

**Notes**

***Mutual TLS***

If a mutual TLS certificate is configured for gNMI or TerminAttr, the server may not be affected by authentication vulnerabilities CVE-2021-28500, CVE-2021-28501 and CVE-2021-28506. This does not apply to RESTCONF.

OpenConfig gNMI is configured with SSL profile

```
management api gnmi
   transport grpc default
      ssl profile mtls-grpc-profile
management security
   ssl profile mtls-grpc-profile
      certificate target.crt key target.key
      trust certificate ca.crt
```

TerminAttr is configured with SSL profile

```
daemon TerminAttr
   exec /usr/bin/TerminAttr
      -certfile /persist/secure/ssl/certs/target.crt
      -keyfile /persist/secure/ssl/keys/target.key
      -clientcafile /persist/secure/ssl/certs/ca.crt
   no shutdown
```
### Symptoms

The following system logs at /var/log/messages may indicate vulnerability to CVE-2021-28500. When a gNMI Set is issued, the host should be recognized.

```
Nov 24 02:31:20 cd217 ConfigAgent: %SYS-5-CONFIG_SESSION_ENTERED: User admin entered configuration session session1068691224937 on GNMI (10.24.128.7:46054)
Nov 24 02:31:22 cd217 ConfigAgent: %SYS-5-CONFIG_SESSION_COMMIT_SUCCESS: User admin committed configuration session session1068691224937 successfully on GNMI (10.24.128.7:46054)
Nov 24 02:31:22 cd217 ConfigAgent: %SYS-5-CONFIG_SESSION_EXITED: User admin exited configuration session session1068691224937 on GNMI (10.24.128.7:46054)
```

The following symptoms may indicate vulnerability to this issue:

Check if the installed software is an affected version.
 Terminattr

```
switch#show version detail | grep TerminAttr-core
TerminAttr-core      v1.15.3          1

```
### Mitigation

The following configuration changes may be made in order to remedy the exploitation of the listed vulnerabilities.

**Disable affected agents:**

On the affected versions, all vulnerabilities can be mitigated by disabling OpenConfig gNMI/gNOI and OpenConfig RESTCONF and TerminAttr. If use of these agents is required, a hotfix employing a proxy service can be deployed.

Disable OpenConfig gNMI

```
management api gnmi
   transport grpc default
      shutdown
```

Disable OpenConfig RESTCONF

```
management api restconf
   transport https default
      shutdown
```

Disable OpenConfig TerminAttr

```
daemon TerminAttr
    shutdown
```

**CVE-2021-28500 and CVE-2021-28501**

For local users whose authentication is with nopassword, enforce a password or remove the user.

Ensure that the following configuration does not exist where a local user is configured with nopassword.

```
username admin nopassword
```

Instead, a password can be enforced for the local user.

```
username admin secret 0 pass123
```

Please refer to the [EOS user security manual](/um-eos/eos-user-security) for further information.

**CVE-2021-28506 and CVE-2021-28507**

No mitigation options available

For the final resolution, please refer to the resolution section which lists the details of the remediated software versions.

**Hotfix**

To mitigate CVE-2021-28500, CVE-2021-28501, CVE-2021-28506 and CVE-2021-28507 with the continued use of the affected agents, a hotfix employing a proxy service can be deployed. The proxy is configured behind the gNMI/gNOI or RESTCONF server.

OpenConfigProxy is a universal proxy for the OpenConfig gNMI/gNOI server, OpenConfig RESTCONF server or TerminAttr gNMI server. The proxy performs:

* IP ACL check
* Authentication
* Authorization (for gNMI/gNOI only, disabled by default)

Requests are forwarded to the OpenConfig gNMI/gNOI server or RESTCONF server or TerminAttr gNMI server. Responses are sent to the collector from the gNMI/gNOI server or RESTCONF server via the proxy.

Hotfix Notes:

* The hotfix employing a proxy service is version agnostic (i.e., the proxy can be installed on any affected version).
* The hotfix employing a proxy service does not require a restart of the OpenConfig/Octa agent. Only OpenConfig gNMI or RESTCONF configuration changes are required.
* The hotfix employing a proxy service installation is hitless and a reload of the switch is not required for the hotfix to take effect.

TerminAttr Note: For TerminAttr, it is recommended to update to TerminAttr v1.16.3 or above as its agent can be updated independently of the EOS version.

The following hotfix is available to remedy all CVE’s listed in this Security Advisory:
