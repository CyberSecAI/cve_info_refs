Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described as CVE-2021-28447:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the Windows loader's (winload.exe or winload.efi) incorrect handling of large registry values within the ELAM (Early Launch Anti-Malware) hive. Specifically, when an ELAM value (Measured, Policy, or Config) exceeds 16344 bytes, the Windows loader fails to parse the "big data record" structure used to store these large values in the registry. Instead, it treats this structure itself as the value data, leading to the measurement of incorrect data during the measured boot process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Incorrect Value Data Measurement:** The core issue lies in the Windows loader's failure to recognize and correctly process the "big data record" format when reading ELAM values exceeding 16344 bytes. This leads to a situation where the Windows loader measures parts of the registry file structure itself rather than the actual value data.
- **Lack of Format Version Checks:** The Windows loader doesn't check the registry hive format version or the size of value data, and doesn't implement logic for handling the big data record. This is the underlying reason for the parsing failure.
- **Inconsistent Registry Parsing:** The vulnerability highlights the inconsistency in how registry data is parsed between the Windows loader (during measured boot) and the Windows kernel (when ELAM drivers are executed). The Windows loader is missing the logic for handling big data records.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Circumvention of Measured Boot:** By manipulating the ELAM hive, an attacker can alter or downgrade ELAM signatures without affecting the calculated PCR (Platform Configuration Register) values. This is possible because the measured data does not correspond to actual value data.
- **ELAM Downgrade or Deletion:** An attacker can corrupt or downgrade existing ELAM blobs and prevent the ELAM drivers from properly assessing other boot-start drivers, as the measurement of the modified blob will remain the same.
- **Boot-Time Malware:** This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the security mechanisms provided by ELAM, potentially enabling the execution of malicious boot-start drivers or other malicious code during the boot process.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious User-Mode Program:** An attacker with administrator privileges can directly modify the ELAM hive file using a hex editor, or through Windows API calls if the hive is mounted. This is possible because the ELAM hive is not loaded after the boot.
- **Direct Registry File Modification:** Because the ELAM hive is a file, an attacker can use a hex editor or similar tool to directly modify it after unmounting it. This allows bypassing any limitations of registry APIs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Administrator Privileges:** The attacker needs to have administrator-level access to the system to modify the ELAM hive file.
- **Knowledge of Registry File Format:** Understanding the ELAM hive file's binary format is necessary to perform targeted modifications, particularly for exploiting scenarios that involve manipulating the location of big data records and value data segments within the file.
- **Ability to Modify Files:** The attacker needs the ability to modify files on the system, specifically the ELAM registry hive located at *C:\Windows\System32\config\ELAM*.

**Additional Notes**
- The content also describes a related vulnerability, CVE-2021-27094 which was fixed by introducing the lexicographical order check in the Windows loader, but this caused a serious data corruption issue when checking the SYSTEM hive. The fix is limited to key names using ASCII characters only.

In summary, CVE-2021-28447 represents a critical flaw in the Windows boot process that can be exploited to bypass security measures, making the system vulnerable to malicious boot-time attacks.
