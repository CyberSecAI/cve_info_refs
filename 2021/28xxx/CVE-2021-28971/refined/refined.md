{
  "CVE-2021-28971": {
    "Root cause": "A workaround for a hardware bug on Intel CPUs codenamed \"Haswell\" and earlier could lead to a null pointer dereference in the performance event handler for Intel PEBS.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "Impact": "System crash (denial of service).",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to performance events.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user with permission to access performance events. By default, unprivileged users do not have access to performance events, which mitigates the issue. This is controlled by the kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl."
  }
