Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28094:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the use of a weak hashing algorithm (CRC32) to generate cache keys for converted documents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Authorization (CWE-285):**  The system improperly authorizes access to cached converted documents due to the weak hashing algorithm.
- **Hash Collision Vulnerability:** The use of CRC32 for cache key generation makes the system susceptible to both accidental and deliberate hash collisions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Loss:** An attacker can potentially cause the system to serve the cached content of one document when another, different document is requested. This can lead to unintended disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Integrity Loss:**  The attacker can swap document content, affecting the integrity of the cached information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- An attacker needs to create two distinct document files that produce the same CRC32 hash value.
- The attacker uploads both files, forcing their storage in the cache.
- By first requesting one document and then another that has a colliding hash key, the attacker can force the system to serve the cached content of the first document for the second request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must be able to upload files to the vulnerable system (low privilege).
- The attacker needs the ability to request cached resources (view documents).
- The attacker needs to be able to craft colliding document files.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in Open-Xchange's `documentconverter` component.
- Affected versions include 7.10.5 and earlier.
- The issue was fixed in versions 7.10.3-rev34, 7.10.4-rev20, and 7.10.5-rev7.
- The fix involved replacing the weak CRC32 algorithm with SHA-256 for cache key generation.
- The CVSS score is 5.9 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N), indicating a medium severity.
