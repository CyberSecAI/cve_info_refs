- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improperly validated requests to external resources.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Security feature bypass, potentially leading to unauthorized access to internal resources or services, information disclosure or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks, where the attacker crafts malicious requests that the server will make on its behalf.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have some level of access to the AEM application (low privilege) to initiate a request.
