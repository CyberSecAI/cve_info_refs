The content is related to CVE-2021-28236.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by NULL pointer dereferences in the `dxfb_tables_write` function within the `out_dxfb.c` file. These dereferences occur at different lines within the function (1902, 1924, 1872, and 1944), indicating multiple potential issues related to handling table data during the conversion from DWG to DXF format.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the presence of NULL pointer dereferences. This means the code attempts to access memory at address `0x000000000038`, resulting in a segmentation fault and program termination. The underlying cause of the NULL pointers is likely related to how the table data is parsed or accessed when converting from DWG to DXF.

**Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation leads to a denial of service (DoS) due to program crashes when converting specially crafted DWG files. The program terminates abruptly, preventing the successful completion of the file conversion process.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through processing a maliciously crafted DWG file. The `dwg2dxf` tool crashes during the DWG to DXF conversion process when encountering specific malformed data within the DWG files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted DWG file to the `dwg2dxf` tool. No other specific privileges or positions are required. The attacker does not need local access to the vulnerable system, and only needs to cause a crash when the file is processed.
