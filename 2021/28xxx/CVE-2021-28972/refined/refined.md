{
  "CVE-2021-28972": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `add_slot_store()` and `remove_slot_store()` functions within `drivers/pci/hotplug/rpadlpar_sysfs.c` of the Linux kernel. These functions copy a device resource configuration name (`drc_name`) from a user-supplied buffer into a static buffer without proper null-termination.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
       "Improper Null Termination"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially corrupting kernel memory and possibly causing a system crash or other undefined behavior.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by writing to the `add_slot` or `remove_slot` sysfs attributes with a long string. This can be done by a local attacker with the ability to write to this specific sysfs entry.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "A local attacker with the ability to write to the `add_slot` or `remove_slot` sysfs attributes."
