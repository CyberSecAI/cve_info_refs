|  | // - This creates a (mut) reference to a slice of |

|  | // |
|  | // - Only the standard library gets to soundly "ignore" this, |
|  | // based on its privileged knowledge of unstable rustc |
|  | // internals; |
|  | g.buf.reserve(reservation\_size(r)); |
|  | let capacity = g.buf.capacity(); |
|  | g.buf.set\_len(capacity); |
|  | r.initializer().initialize(&mut g.buf[g.len..]); |
|  | } |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | match r.read(&mut g.buf[g.len..]) { |
|  | Ok(0) => { |
|  | ret = Ok(g.len - start\_len); |
|  | break; |
|  | } |
|  | Ok(n) => g.len += n, |
|  | Err(ref e) if e.kind() == ErrorKind::Interrupted => {} |
|  | Err(e) => { |
|  | ret = Err(e); |
|  | break; |
|  | } |
|  | } |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | ret |
|  | } |

At line 393, the guard object's `.len` field is incremented by the value returned from a read implementation. If a questionable `Read` returns a value larger than the buffer size, it will take that value and set the length of the vector over the boundary.

This bug is reachable from `Read::read_to_end()` and `Read::read_to_string()`.

Here is a [playground link](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=c0ea390522bda958c9d60ad47a42e296) that demonstrates the bug. It segfaults with `double free or corruption (out)`.

# Rust: Multiple Vulnerabilities ‚Äî GLSA **202210-09**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rust, the worst of which could result in denial of service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/rust** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.63.0-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.63.0-r1** |

| Package | **dev-lang/rust-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.64.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.64.0** |

### Background

A systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rust. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Please review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Rust users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/rust-1.63.0-r1"

```

All Rust binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/rust-bin-1.64.0"

```

In addition, users using Portage 3.0.38 or later should ensure that packages with Rust binaries have no vulnerable code statically linked into their binaries by rebuilding the @rust-rebuild set:

```
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose @rust-rebuild

```

A malicious `Read` impl could return overly large values from `read`, which would result in the guard's drop impl setting the buffer's length to greater than its capacity! ~~To fix this, the drop impl now uses the safe `truncate` function instead of `set_len` which ensures that this will not happen. The result of calling the function will be nonsensical, but that's fine given the contract violation of the `Read` impl.~~

~~The `Guard` type is also used by `append_to_string` which does not pass untrusted values into the length field, so I've copied the guard type into each function and only modified the one used by `read_to_end`. We could just keep a single one and modify it, but it seems a bit cleaner to keep the guard code close to the functions and related specifically to them.~~

To fix this, we now assert that the returned length is not larger than the buffer passed to the method.

For reference, this bug has been present for ~2.5 years since 1.20: [ecbb896](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/ecbb896b9eb2acadefde57be493e4298c1aa04a3).

Closes [#80894](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80894).

We could, but I would rather keep the codepath oriented as much as possible towards non-malicious implementations. Overflow can only be caused by bogus return values, and just means that a nonsensical result will be returned.

Malicious `Read` can shrink `g.len` with an overflow, which in turn can lead to a violation of `append_to_string()`'s second requirement. (and `append_to_string()` should probably be marked as an unsafe function)

Ah right. We'll need to replace that with a checked\_add then.

This kind of mess is one of the things that the ReadBuf proposal is designed to avoid, so things should get less janky when that's implemented.

Would it make sense to slice the slice that's been passed into the `read` call in the first place and then take its length? As in:

```
let buffer = &mut g.buf[g.len..];
match r.read(buffer) {
    // ...
    Ok(n) => g.len += buffer[..n].len(),
}
```

or something along those lines? It has an added benefit of also detecting when returned `n` is greater than the length of the length of the buffer provided, and may result in slightly less code generated overall.

This check already is looking for n being greater than the length of the buffer, but agreed that structuring it like that is a bit more clear. Will update later today.

Fix handling of malicious Readers in read_to_end

A malicious `Read` impl could return overly large values from `read`, which would result in the guard's drop impl setting the buffer's length to greater than its capacity! ~~To fix this, the drop impl now uses the safe `truncate` function instead of `set_len` which ensures that this will not happen. The result of calling the function will be nonsensical, but that's fine given the contract violation of the `Read` impl.~~

~~The `Guard` type is also used by `append_to_string` which does not pass untrusted values into the length field, so I've copied the guard type into each function and only modified the one used by `read_to_end`. We could just keep a single one and modify it, but it seems a bit cleaner to keep the guard code close to the functions and related specifically to them.~~

To fix this, we now assert that the returned length is not larger than the buffer passed to the method.

For reference, this bug has been present for ~2.5 years since 1.20: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/ecbb896b9eb2acadefde57be493e4298c1aa04a3.

Clarify docs for Read::read's return value

Right now the docs for `Read::read`'s return value are phrased in a way that makes it easy for the reader to assume that the return value is never larger than the passed buffer. This PR clarifies that this is a requirement for implementations of the trait, but that callers have to expect a buggy yet safe implementation failing to do so, especially if unchecked accesses to the buffer are done afterwards.

I fell into this trap recently, and when I noticed, I looked at the docs again and had the feeling that I might not have been the first one to miss this.
