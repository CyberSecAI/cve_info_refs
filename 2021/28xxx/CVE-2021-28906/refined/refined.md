Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28906:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists within the `read_yin_leaf` function of the libyang library. Specifically, the code attempts to access `retval->ext[r]->flags` without verifying if `retval->ext[r]` is NULL, leading to a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Null pointer dereference. The code directly accesses the `flags` member of a pointer without checking if the pointer is valid (not NULL).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Crash/Denial of Service (DoS). The null pointer dereference leads to a program crash, effectively causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of a YANG module with unresolved extensions. An attacker can craft a malicious YANG module that includes these extensions to exploit this flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted YANG module to be parsed by a vulnerable version of libyang.

**Additional Notes**
- The issue was resolved in libyang version 1.0.236 and later.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 202107-54) includes this CVE and identifies it as a remote exploitable issue.
