Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of `${}` in the SQL queries within the `SysUserMapper.xml` mapper file. Specifically, the parameter `compId` is directly inserted into the SQL query without proper sanitization or using prepared statements, where `${}` allows for direct string substitution instead of using a parameter. The code then uses a String type to handle compId, further exacerbating the problem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Direct SQL injection:** The use of `${}` allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code, as the provided input is directly concatenated into the query string.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `compId` parameter is not validated or sanitized before being used in the SQL query.
*   **String Type Handling:** The use of String for compId allows any value, including malicious SQL statements, to be passed and processed without constraints.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Exposure:** Attackers can extract sensitive database information, including usernames, passwords, and other confidential data. As demonstrated by the provided example, the attacker was able to identify the database name "fastdb".
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker can potentially modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database setup and the permissions associated with the database user used by the application, attackers might be able to escalate their privileges.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers might be able to craft SQL queries that cause the database to perform poorly or crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The vulnerable parameters `deptId` (in `http://demo.j2eefast.com/fast/sys/role/list`) and `roleId` (in `http://demo.j2eefast.com/fast/sys/role/authUser/list`) are passed via HTTP requests and are susceptible to SQL injection through manipulating these parameters.
*   **User Input:** The application takes user-provided input (such as `compId`) and directly incorporates it into the SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the application.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL Injection:** Attackers need a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.
*   **Authentication (Potentially):** While the provided reproduction steps include logging in with a specific username ("00008"), it's possible the vulnerability exists for other authenticated users. The level of access required to exploit this would depend on which parts of the application are using this vulnerable parameter and can be used to perform SQL queries.

**Additional Details:**

*   The content provides clear examples of how to identify the vulnerability by injecting simple SQL queries (e.g., `1'+or+length(database())=6+and+'1'='1`).
*   The content also suggests how to fix the vulnerability by using `#{} `instead of `${}` in the mapper files and/or performing type casting of parameters to ensure the passed parameters are an integer rather than a string.
*   The issue was reported and subsequently resolved with commit `81500065bfe63a09965076b7d204a58cfaf73fdd` and pull requests `!34` and `!35`.
