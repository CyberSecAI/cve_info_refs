Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-28591:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds write, which occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution. This means an attacker can run malicious code on the user's system with the privileges of the current user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the system to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable code by getting the user to open a specially crafted file. The user interface interaction (UI:R) means that user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability (e.g., by opening a malicious file).
*   The attacker does not need any privileges (PR:N) to execute the attack.
