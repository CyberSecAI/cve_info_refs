Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-28856

**Root Cause:** Division by zero error.

**Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `fmtutil_macbitmap_read_pixmap_only_fields` function within `src/fmtutil.c` at line 1621 of Deark v1.5.7-1.
- The code calculates `bi->pdwidth` by dividing `(bi->rowbytes * 8)` by `bi->pixelsize`.
- If `bi->pixelsize` is zero, this operation results in a division by zero error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A division by zero error can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- A specially crafted input file is required to trigger the vulnerability. This input file must be designed such that when parsed by Deark, the value of `bi->pixelsize` becomes zero.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted input file to the Deark application.
- No special privileges are needed beyond the ability to execute the Deark program with a crafted input file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability is a simple check to ensure that `bi->pixelsize` is not zero before performing the division.
- The commit `62acb7753b0e3c0d3ab3c15057b0a65222313334` on the Deark GitHub repository addresses this issue.
- The vulnerability was found by F. Ã‡elik.
