Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28116:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds memory access within the Squid proxy cache when processing WCCPv2 messages. Specifically, there is a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, leading to a read operation beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The software reads data beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer, potentially leading to information disclosure.
- Improper input validation: The application fails to validate user-supplied data, leading to the out-of-bounds read.
- Memory corruption: The out-of-bounds read can corrupt the list of known WCCP routers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure**: A remote attacker can potentially leak sensitive information by triggering an out-of-bounds read.
- **Traffic redirection**: An attacker can corrupt Squid's list of known WCCP routers and divert client traffic to attacker-controlled routers. This can lead to further exploitation such as man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Denial of Service (indirect)**: While not a direct DoS, the ability to redirect traffic can effectively lead to denial of service.
- Code Execution (potential): The Zero Day Initiative advisory notes that an attacker can potentially use this vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the "nobody" user.

**Attack vectors:**
- **WCCPv2 messages:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing maliciously crafted WCCPv2 messages.
- **Network-based**: The attack is performed over the network, requiring no prior authentication.
- **IP Spoofing:** An attacker must spoof the IP address of a router configured as trusted in squid.conf.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote attacker**: The attacker can be remote, not requiring any local access.
- **WCCPv2 enabled**: The target Squid proxy must have WCCPv2 enabled and configured with `wccp2_router` in `squid.conf`.
- **Network access**: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted UDP WCCPv2 messages to the Squid server.
- **IP spoofing**: The attacker must be able to spoof a trusted router IP address.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects a range of Squid versions: 2.6 -> 2.7.STABLE9, 3.x -> 3.5.28, 4.x -> 4.16, and 5.x -> 5.1
- Fixed in Squid versions 4.17 and 5.2.
- The severity of the vulnerability is considered High, with a CVSS score of 7.7
- Workarounds include using private IP addresses for control communication, firewall restrictions for WCCP(v2) traffic, implementing BCP38 spoofing protection, disabling WCCPv2 or removing WCCPv2 directives from squid.conf.
