The provided content is related to CVE-2021-28070.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in PopojiCMS that allows an attacker to delete a user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   CSRF vulnerability: The application does not properly validate requests, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious request that the victim's browser will execute, leading to unintended actions, such as deleting a user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   User deletion: An attacker can delete a user account by tricking an authenticated administrator into accessing the crafted malicious HTML.

**Attack vectors:**
*   CSRF: The attacker creates a malicious HTML page containing a form that sends a request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   Social engineering: The attacker must trick an authenticated administrator into opening the attacker's malicious HTML page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to create a malicious HTML page with the CSRF attack.
*   The attacker must successfully trick an authenticated administrator into visiting the crafted HTML page while logged in to the PopojiCMS application.
