Hi,

Is there a way to identify if a system's ACPI tables have untranslated
regions?  Does it show up in xen or linux dmesg or can it be
identified in sysfs?

Thanks,
Jason

 Xen Security Advisory CVE-2021-28694,CVE-2021-28695,CVE-2021-28696 / XSA-378
                                   version 3

                   IOMMU page mapping issues on x86

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Warn about dom0=pvh breakage in Resolution section.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Both AMD and Intel allow ACPI tables to specify regions of memory
which should be left untranslated, which typically means these
addresses should pass the translation phase unaltered.  While these
are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be
specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices.

On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from
undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694).

On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware,
the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped
(CVE-2021-28695).

Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a
guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest
continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to
anymore (CVE-2021-28696).

IMPACT
======

The precise impact is system specific, but can - on affected systems -
be any or all of privilege escalation, denial of service, or information
leaks.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

The vulnerability is only exploitable by guests granted access to
physical devices (ie, via PCI passthrough).

All versions of Xen are affected.

Only x86 systems with IOMMUs and with firmware specifying memory regions
to be identity mapped are affected.  Other x86 systems are not affected.

Whether a particular system whose ACPI tables declare such memory
region(s) is actually affected cannot be known without knowing when
and/or how these regions are used.  For example, if these regions were
used only during system boot, there would not be any vulnerability.
The necessary knowledge can only be obtained from, collectively, the
hardware and firmware manufacturers.

On Arm hardware IOMMU use is not security supported.  Accordingly, we
have not undertaken an analysis of these issues for Arm systems.

MITIGATION
==========

Not permitting untrusted guests access to phsyical devices will avoid
the vulnerability.

Likewise, limiting untrusted guest access to physical devices whose
firmware-provided ACPI tables declare identity mappings, will avoid
the vulnerability.  (Provided that there are no identity mapped
regions which are specified by the ACPI tables to apply globally.)

Note that a system is still vulnerable if a guest was trusted, while
it had such a device assigned, and then has the device removed in
anticipation of the guest becoming untrusted (because of, for example,
the insertion of an untrusted kernel module),

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate set of attached patches resolves this issue.

However, these patches are known to badly break PVH dom0 support.
Work is ongoing to resolve the problem, and will be committed to the
appropriate Xen trees (including backports) when ready.  PVH dom0 has
"Technical Preview" status so we do not intend to distribute the fixes
via an update to this advisory

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

Xen Security Advisory CVE-2021-28694,CVE-2021-28695,CVE-2021-28696 / XSA-378
version 3
IOMMU page mapping issues on x86
UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================
Warn about dom0=pvh breakage in Resolution section.
ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================
Both AMD and Intel allow ACPI tables to specify regions of memory
which should be left untranslated, which typically means these
addresses should pass the translation phase unaltered. While these
are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be
specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices.
On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from
undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694).
On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware,
the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped
(CVE-2021-28695).
Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a
guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest
continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to
anymore (CVE-2021-28696).
IMPACT
======
The precise impact is system specific, but can - on affected systems -
be any or all of privilege escalation, denial of service, or information
leaks.
VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================
The vulnerability is only exploitable by guests granted access to
physical devices (ie, via PCI passthrough).
All versions of Xen are affected.
Only x86 systems with IOMMUs and with firmware specifying memory regions
to be identity mapped are affected. Other x86 systems are not affected.
Whether a particular system whose ACPI tables declare such memory
region(s) is actually affected cannot be known without knowing when
and/or how these regions are used. For example, if these regions were
used only during system boot, there would not be any vulnerability.
The necessary knowledge can only be obtained from, collectively, the
hardware and firmware manufacturers.
On Arm hardware IOMMU use is not security supported. Accordingly, we
have not undertaken an analysis of these issues for Arm systems.
MITIGATION
==========
Not permitting untrusted guests access to phsyical devices will avoid
the vulnerability.
Likewise, limiting untrusted guest access to physical devices whose
firmware-provided ACPI tables declare identity mappings, will avoid
the vulnerability. (Provided that there are no identity mapped
regions which are specified by the ACPI tables to apply globally.)
Note that a system is still vulnerable if a guest was trusted, while
it had such a device assigned, and then has the device removed in
anticipation of the guest becoming untrusted (because of, for example,
the insertion of an untrusted kernel module),
CREDITS
=======
This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.
RESOLUTION
==========
Applying the appropriate set of attached patches resolves this issue.
However, these patches are known to badly break PVH dom0 support.
Work is ongoing to resolve the problem, and will be committed to the
appropriate Xen trees (including backports) when ready. PVH dom0 has
"Technical Preview" status so we do not intend to distribute the fixes
via an update to this advisory
Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball. Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================
Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.
But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).
Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.
(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable. This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor,
which could result in privilege escalation, denial of service or
information leaks.

With the end of upstream support for the 4.11 branch, the version of xen
in the oldstable distribution (buster) is no longer supported. If you
rely on security support for your Xen installation an update to the
stable distribution (bullseye) is recommended.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.14.3-1~deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.

For the detailed security status of xen please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/xen>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

It's possible, but a little convoluted to do.  In dom0 (and in an empty
directory) you want:

acpidump > acpi.dmp
acpixtract -a acpi.dmp

On Intel, open up rmad.dat and hexedit the first 4 bytes from RMAD to
DMAR (yes - really - this is how we stop the dom0 kernel from trying to
poke the IOMMU directly.)

Then disassemble (iasl -d) either rmad.dat or ivrs.dat depending on
whether you're on Intel or AMD.

On Intel, you're looking for Reserved Memory Regions, while on AMD
you're looking for IVMD ranges (specifically, types 20 thru 22)

These, if present, describe a range of memory needing identity mapping,
and a scope of the PCI device(s) the range applies to.
