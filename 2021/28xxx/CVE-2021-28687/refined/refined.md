Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28687:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing initialization of the `libxl__domain_suspend_state` structure within the "soft reset" feature of Xen. Although an initialization function was introduced for this structure, the "soft reset" path was not updated to use it. This leads to the use of an uninitialized data structure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of uninitialized data: The core issue is that the `libxl__domain_suspend_state` structure is not initialized before being used in the soft reset path. This can lead to unpredictable behavior.
- Missing input validation: The lack of initialization leads to an assert() failure later on when code encounters the data structure in an unexpected state.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS):
    -  **Localized DoS:** For `xl` based setups, the guest domain process will crash and hang, requiring the use of `xl destroy`.
    -  **System-wide DoS:** For daemon-based toolstacks (like libvirt) that link against libxl, the toolstack will crash, leading to the loss of state for in-progress operations, and preventing administrator operations until the daemon is restarted.
    - Repeated crashes could potentially lead to resource exhaustion (memory leaks) resulting in a more severe system-wide DoS.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious guest can initiate a soft reboot to trigger the uninitialized data structure issue.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have control of a guest domain within the affected Xen environment.
- The attacker needs to be able to initiate a soft reboot of their controlled guest.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Xen versions 4.12 through 4.14.
- Systems using the `xl` command-line tool are less affected (only localized DoS), while those using daemons that link against libxl (e.g. libvirt) are more vulnerable.
- The provided information includes patches for the affected versions.
