Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization when adding questions to the "Web Based Quiz System". Specifically, the application does not sanitize the "MCQ options" parameter allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored/persistent XSS. The injected JavaScript payload is stored in the database and executed when a user views the quiz, as the vulnerable parameter is rendered without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application.
- **Session Hijacking:** The provided payload demonstrates the ability to steal cookies using `document.cookie`, which can be used to hijack user sessions.
- **Account Compromise:** By stealing cookies, the attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to other user accounts.
- **Malicious Actions:**  The attacker could perform a variety of other malicious actions on behalf of the victim such as redirecting the user to a malicious site, modifying the content of the web page, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack is performed through the web interface of the application when adding or modifying quiz questions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Admin Access:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator to add/modify quiz questions. This suggests that the vulnerability is in the administrative functionality of the application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the "MCQ options" parameter is vulnerable to XSS.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content includes a full exploit PoC, including the vulnerable parameter, payload, and steps to reproduce the attack.
- The vulnerable application is "Web Based Quiz System" version 1.0.
- The vulnerability is in the `update.php` script when adding/modifying quiz questions.
- The injected payload is `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`.
- The vulnerability is classified as stored/persistent XSS because the payload is stored in the database.
- The content provides a specific request showing how the malicious payload is injected.
