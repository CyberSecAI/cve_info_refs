  "vulnerability_details": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to create a denial-of-service condition on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the AppX Deployment Service. By creating a directory junction, an attacker can abuse the service to delete the contents of a chosen directory. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service condition on the system.",
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the AppX Deployment Service where improper handling of directory junctions allows deletion of arbitrary directory contents.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Improper handling of directory junctions",
    "Abuse of service to delete arbitrary directory contents"
  ],
  "impact": "Denial-of-service condition on the system.",
