{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `Zip::next()` implementation in Rust's standard library has a panic safety issue. If the `__iterator_get_unchecked()` call within `next()` panics, the index is not incremented, and a subsequent call to `next()` will reuse the same index.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `TrustedRandomAccess` trait in Rust has a safety requirement that `get_unchecked` is never called with the same index on a `!Clone` iterator more than once. This requirement is violated due to the panic safety issue."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability allows for the creation of two mutable references to the same memory location, violating Rust's memory safety guarantees, and potentially leading to undefined behavior such as data corruption, or denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the usage of the `Zip` iterator with a non-cloneable iterator that implements `TrustedRandomAccess`, where the `__iterator_get_unchecked()` method of the underlying iterator panics.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to control the behavior of the iterator used with `Zip` so that the `__iterator_get_unchecked` method panics. This can be achieved if the iterator's implementation can panic based on attacker provided input, or if the attacker can cause a panic condition on the iterator when accessing a specific index."
