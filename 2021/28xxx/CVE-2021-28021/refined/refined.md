  "cveId": "CVE-2021-28021",
  "description": "Buffer overflow vulnerability in function stbi__extend_receive in stb_image.h in stb 2.26 via a crafted JPEG file.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in the `stbi__extend_receive()` function within `stb_image.h`. This happens when a crafted JPEG file is processed by the library.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS) or information disclosure, depending on how the application uses the vulnerable `stb` functionality.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Processing a crafted JPEG file."
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to submit a specially crafted JPEG file to an application using the vulnerable stb functionality.",
    "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability lies in how the library handles certain values from `stbi__jpeg_huff_decode()`, which, if out of range, cause an out-of-bounds read when used in `stbi__extend_receive()`. The `stbi__extend_receive()` function is designed to handle values less than or equal to 15. The fix involves checking if DC delta bits are within range before calling the function."
