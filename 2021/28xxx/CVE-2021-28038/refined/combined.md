Debian Bug     : 983595

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service, or information leaks.

CVE-2020-27170, CVE-2020-27171

    Piotr Krysiuk discovered flaws in the BPF subsystem's checks for
    information leaks through speculative execution.  A local user
    could use these to obtain sensitive information from kernel
    memory.

CVE-2021-3348

    ADlab of venustech discovered a race condition in the nbd block
    driver that can lead to a use-after-free.  A local user with
    access to an nbd block device could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-3428

    Wolfgang Frisch reported a potential integer overflow in the
    ext4 filesystem driver.  A user permitted to mount arbitrary
    filesystem images could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365)

    Olivier Benjamin, Norbert Manthey, Martin Mazein, and Jan
    H. Sch√∂nherr discovered that the Xen block backend driver
    (xen-blkback) did not handle grant mapping errors correctly.  A
    malicious guest could exploit this bug to cause a denial of
    service (crash), or possibly an information leak or privilege
    escalation, within the domain running the backend, which is
    typically dom0.

CVE-2021-26931 (XSA-362), CVE-2021-26932 (XSA-361), CVE-2021-28038 (XSA-367)

    Jan Beulich discovered that the Xen support code and various Xen
    backend drivers did not handle grant mapping errors correctly.  A
    malicious guest could exploit these bugs to cause a denial of
    service (crash) within the domain running the backend, which is
    typically dom0.

CVE-2021-27363

    Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
    properly restrict access to transport handle attributes in sysfs.
    On a system acting as an iSCSI initiator, this is an information
    leak to local users and makes it easier to exploit CVE-2021-27364.

CVE-2021-27364

    Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
    properly restrict access to its netlink management interface.  On
    a system acting as an iSCSI initiator, a local user could use
    these to cause a denial of service (disconnection of storage) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-27365

    Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
    correctly limit the lengths of parameters or "passthrough PDUs"
    sent through its netlink management interface.  On a system acting
    as an iSCSI initiator, a local user could use these to leak the
    contents of kernel memory, to cause a denial of service (kernel
    memory corruption or crash), and probably for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-28660

    It was discovered that the rtl8188eu WiFi driver did not correctly
    limit the length of SSIDs copied into scan results.  An attacker
    within WiFi range could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to execute code on a
    vulnerable system.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.181-1~deb9u1.  This update additionally fixes Debian bug
#983595, and includes many more bug fixes from stable updates
4.19.172-4.19.181 inclusive.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.19 packages.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2019-19318, CVE-2019-19813, CVE-2019-19816

    "Team bobfuzzer" reported bugs in Btrfs that could lead to a
    use-after-free or heap buffer overflow, and could be triggered by
    crafted filesystem images.  A user permitted to mount and access
    arbitrary filesystems could use these to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-27815

    A flaw was reported in the JFS filesystem code allowing a local
    attacker with the ability to set extended attributes to cause a
    denial of service.

CVE-2020-27825

    Adam 'pi3' Zabrocki reported a use-after-free flaw in the ftrace
    ring buffer resizing logic due to a race condition, which could
    result in denial of service or information leak.

CVE-2020-28374

    David Disseldorp discovered that the LIO SCSI target implementation
    performed insufficient checking in certain XCOPY requests. An
    attacker with access to a LUN and knowledge of Unit Serial Number
    assignments can take advantage of this flaw to read and write to any
    LIO backstore, regardless of the SCSI transport settings.

CVE-2020-29568 (XSA-349)

    Michael Kurth and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported that frontends can
    trigger OOM in backends by updating a watched path.

CVE-2020-29569 (XSA-350)

    Olivier Benjamin and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported a use-after-free
    flaw which can be triggered by a block frontend in Linux blkback. A
    misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by continuously
    connecting / disconnecting a block frontend.

CVE-2020-29660

    Jann Horn reported a locking inconsistency issue in the tty
    subsystem which may allow a local attacker to mount a
    read-after-free attack against TIOCGSID.

CVE-2020-29661

    Jann Horn reported a locking issue in the tty subsystem which can
    result in a use-after-free. A local attacker can take advantage of
    this flaw for memory corruption or privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-36158

    A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the mwifiex WiFi driver
    which could result in denial of service or the execution of
    arbitrary code via a long SSID value.

CVE-2021-3178

    Âê¥ÂºÇ reported an information leak in the NFSv3 server.  When only
    a subdirectory of a filesystem volume is exported, an NFS client
    listing the exported directory would obtain a file handle to the
    parent directory, allowing it to access files that were not meant
    to be exported.

    Even after this update, it is still possible for NFSv3 clients to
    guess valid file handles and access files outside an exported
    subdirectory, unless the "subtree_check" export option is enabled.
    It is recommended that you do not use that option but only export
    whole filesystem volumes.

CVE-2021-3347

    It was discovered that PI futexes have a kernel stack use-after-free
    during fault handling. An unprivileged user could use this flaw to
    crash the kernel (resulting in denial of service) or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365)

    Olivier Benjamin, Norbert Manthey, Martin Mazein, and Jan
    H. Sch√∂nherr discovered that the Xen block backend driver
    (xen-blkback) did not handle grant mapping errors correctly.  A
    malicious guest could exploit this bug to cause a denial of
    service (crash), or possibly an information leak or privilege
    escalation, within the domain running the backend, which is
    typically dom0.

CVE-2021-26931 (XSA-362), CVE-2021-26932 (XSA-361), CVE-2021-28038 (XSA-367)

    Jan Beulich discovered that the Xen support code and various Xen
    backend drivers did not handle grant mapping errors correctly.  A
    malicious guest could exploit these bugs to cause a denial of
    service (crash) within the domain running the backend, which is
    typically dom0.

CVE-2021-27363

    Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
    properly restrict access to transport handle attributes in sysfs.
    On a system acting as an iSCSI initiator, this is an information
    leak to local users and makes it easier to exploit CVE-2021-27364.

CVE-2021-27364

    Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
    properly restrict access to its netlink management interface.  On
    a system acting as an iSCSI initiator, a local user could use
    these to cause a denial of service (disconnection of storage) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-27365

    Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
    correctly limit the lengths of parameters or "passthrough PDUs"
    sent through its netlink management interface.  On a system acting
    as an iSCSI initiator, a local user could use these to leak the
    contents of kernel memory, to cause a denial of service (kernel
    memory corruption or crash), and probably for privilege
    escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.258-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2021-28038 / XSA-367
                              version 2

          Linux: netback fails to honor grant mapping errors

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

XSA-362 tried to address issues here, but in the case of the netback
driver the changes were insufficient: It left the relevant function
invocation with, effectively, no error handling at all.  As a result,
memory allocation failures there could still lead to frontend-induced
crashes of the backend.

IMPACT
======

A malicious or buggy networking frontend driver may be able to crash
the corresponding backend driver, potentially affecting the entire
domain running the backend driver.  In a typical (non-disaggregated)
system that is a host-wide denial of service (DoS).

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Linux versions from at least 2.6.39 onwards are vulnerable, when run in
PV mode.  Earlier versions differ significantly in behavior and may
therefore instead surface other issues under the same conditions.  Linux
run in HVM / PVH modes is not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

For Linux, running the backends in HVM or PVH domains will avoid the
vulnerability.  For example, by running the dom0 in PVH mode.

In all other cases there is no known mitigation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.

Subject: Xen Security Advisory 367 v2 (CVE-2021-28038) - Linux: netback
 fails to honor grant mapping errors

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2021-28038 / XSA-367
                              version 2

          Linux: netback fails to honor grant mapping errors

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

XSA-362 tried to address issues here, but in the case of the netback
driver the changes were insufficient: It left the relevant function
invocation with, effectively, no error handling at all.  As a result,
memory allocation failures there could still lead to frontend-induced
crashes of the backend.

IMPACT
======

A malicious or buggy networking frontend driver may be able to crash
the corresponding backend driver, potentially affecting the entire
domain running the backend driver.  In a typical (non-disaggregated)
system that is a host-wide denial of service (DoS).

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Linux versions from at least 2.6.39 onwards are vulnerable, when run in
PV mode.  Earlier versions differ significantly in behavior and may
therefore instead surface other issues under the same conditions.  Linux
run in HVM / PVH modes is not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

For Linux, running the backends in HVM or PVH domains will avoid the
vulnerability.  For example, by running the dom0 in PVH mode.

In all other cases there is no known mitigation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.

xsa367-linux.patch           Linux 5.12-rc

$ sha256sum xsa367*
b0244bfddee91cd7986172893e70664b74e698c5d44f25865870f179f80f9a92  xsa367-linux.patch
$

CREDITS
=======

This issue was reported by Intel's kernel test robot and recognized as a
security issue by Jan Beulich of SUSE.

NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO
==============================

This issue was reported publicly, before the XSA could be issued.
