- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap-buffer-overflow in the jpeg-xl decode routine within the djxl tool.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-buffer-overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The heap-buffer-overflow can lead to crashes and potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:**  Decoding a maliciously crafted JPEG-XL file using the djxl tool.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious JPEG-XL file as input to the vulnerable djxl decoder.
