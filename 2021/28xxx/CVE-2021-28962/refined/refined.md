Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28962:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the possibility of injecting CLI commands. This allows a read-only administrator to execute arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary CLI commands.
- **Insufficient Privilege Separation:** Read-only administrators should not have the ability to execute CLI commands that can lead to privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A read-only administrator can elevate their privileges to those of a higher-level user (e.g., root).
- **Confidentiality Impact:** High - The attacker could gain access to sensitive information.
- **Integrity Impact:** High - The attacker could modify system configurations or data.
- **Availability Impact:** High - The attacker could disrupt system services or functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Adjacent Network:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable system on the same network segment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Read-Only Administrator Access:** The attacker must have valid credentials for a read-only administrator account on the Stormshield Network Security (SNS) device.
- **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be on the same adjacent network as the device.
- **Low Attack Complexity:** Exploitation of the vulnerability is considered low in complexity.
- **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required for the exploit to be successful.
