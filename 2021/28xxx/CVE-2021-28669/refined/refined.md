- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the ability to set configuration attributes without requiring administrative privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control leading to unauthorized configuration changes.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially modify the device's configuration, potentially leading to disruption of services, unauthorized access, or other security compromises.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is not explicitly mentioned but involves a mechanism to modify configuration settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need some level of access to the device's interface that allows them to modify configuration attributes, though administrative access is not required.
