Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-28493:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw within Arista's Metamako Operating System (MOS) software, specifically related to how user permissions and command execution are handled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** Under specific circumstances, a user can execute commands without having the necessary privileges to do so. This indicates a failure in the privilege check or enforcement mechanism within the MOS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Command Execution:** An attacker can gain the ability to execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to system compromise or data manipulation.
- **Impact:** The impact is rated as high for both integrity and availability. This could allow for modification of system configuration, denial of service, or other malicious actions. The confidentiality impact is none.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some form of access to the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Low-Privilege Access:** The attacker needs to be a low-privilege user on the affected system. This indicates a user account is needed and that is enough to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in MOS versions 0.32.0 and prior.
*   It affects Arista 7130 Systems running MOS
*   Arista is not aware of any malicious uses of this issue in customer networks

**Mitigation:**
*   Changing home directory permission for privileged groups
*   Changing .bashrc to limit permissions

**Resolution:**
*   Upgrade to MOS version 0.33.0 or later.

This detailed information provides a clear picture of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and the steps required to mitigate and resolve it.
