Root cause of vulnerability:
The Xen hypervisor does not properly track all mappings of grant table v2 status pages within guest memory. When a guest switches from grant table v2 to v1, these pages are deallocated. However, if the guest has raced to create multiple mappings of these pages, the hypervisor might only be aware of one, leading to a use-after-free condition when the guest retains access to the deallocated pages.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Use-after-free vulnerability due to incorrect memory management during grant table v2 to v1 transitions.
- Race condition when a guest attempts to map the same grant table v2 status page to multiple locations in its memory.
- Insufficient tracking by hypervisor of the mappings of these pages within a guest.

Impact of exploitation:
- Privilege escalation: Malicious guest can elevate privileges to that of the host.
- Denial of service (DoS): Malicious guest can cause host or guest to crash.
- Information leaks: Malicious guest can leak sensitive information.

Attack vectors:
- A malicious guest, specifically HVM or PVH guests using grant table v2 interfaces, can exploit the race condition to create multiple mappings of the same grant table v2 status pages. When the guest switches back to v1, the hypervisor frees the page based on its single tracked mapping and the guest can continue to access the freed memory.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to control a guest virtual machine (HVM or PVH) that has the ability to use grant table version 2 interfaces.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code within the guest virtual machine.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the race condition related to grant table v2 status page mappings.
