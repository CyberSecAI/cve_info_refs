  "description": "The default compliance mode allows requests with URIs that contain `%2e` or `%2e%2e` segments to access protected resources within the `WEB-INF` directory. For example a request to `/context/%2e/WEB-INF/web.xml` can retrieve the `web.xml` file. This can reveal sensitive information regarding the implementation of a web application.",
