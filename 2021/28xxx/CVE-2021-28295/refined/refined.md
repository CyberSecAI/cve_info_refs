  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection due to unsanitized user-supplied input within the 'id' parameter of the 'design.php' file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Blind SQL Injection vulnerability exists due to improper input sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can extract sensitive information by querying the database, potentially leading to full database compromise. In this case the attacker is able to enumerate databases.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited via a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint by manipulating the 'id' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application server. No authentication is required."
