The provided content is related to CVE-2021-28095.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a weak hashing algorithm (CRC32) for caching documents in Open-Xchange's office component. This weak hashing mechanism is susceptible to both accidental and deliberate hash collisions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Authorization (CWE-285):** The system does not properly authorize access to cached documents due to the weak hashing algorithm.
- **Hash Collision:** The use of CRC32 for cache keys makes the system vulnerable to hash collisions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can cause the system to serve a cached version of a different document due to hash collisions. This can lead to:
  - **Loss of Confidentiality:** Unauthorized access to the content of documents.
  - **Loss of Integrity:** An attacker can substitute a document with a different one.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by:
1. Creating two documents with XML structures that produce the same CRC32 hash value.
2. Uploading both documents to the vulnerable system.
3. Tricking the system into caching the first document.
4. Accessing the second document, which then retrieves the cached version of the first document.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user with the ability to upload files to the vulnerable system.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft specific document structures to create hash collisions.
