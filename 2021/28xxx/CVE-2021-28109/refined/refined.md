Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28109:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of a URL part used to construct the `login_tw.php` webpage within the TranzWare (POI) FIMI web application. This allows for the injection of malicious code through the URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- Improper input sanitization/validation

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser when they access a crafted URL. This could lead to:
- Session hijacking
- Defacement of the web page
- Phishing attacks
- Redirecting users to malicious sites
- Stealing sensitive information

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code, which is then reflected in the `login_tw.php` webpage.
- The attacker would need to induce a user to click on the malicious URL or have the victim's application send such a request to the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to access the crafted URL, typically through social engineering or other methods.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability affects TranzWare (POI) FIMI versions prior to 4.2.20.4.2.
- The vendor, Compass Plus Ltd., has confirmed and acknowledged the vulnerability, and released a patched version.
- The vulnerability was discovered during a penetration test.
