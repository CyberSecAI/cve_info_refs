  "CVE-2021-28271": {
    "match": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "Root cause": "Insecure permissions on the SOYAL 701Server application's executable file.",
      "Weaknesses": "The application's executable file (`McuServer.exe`) has full control permissions granted to 'Everyone' and 'Authenticated Users', allowing a low-privileged user to replace it with a malicious binary.",
      "Impact": "Local privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local access to the machine where the SOYAL 701Server software is installed.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have a user account on the system with the ability to modify files in the installation directory. This can be achieved via an authenticated user account. The attacker does not need administrative privileges.",
      "Additional details": "The exploit involves replacing the original executable with a malicious one. The vulnerability is present in version 9.0.1 190322 and 8.0.6 181227 of the software. The vulnerability was discovered on January 25, 2021, and reported to the vendor, which acknowledged the issue and promised a patch by February 11, 2021. A public security advisory was released on March 18, 2021. The vulnerability allows for privilege escalation because the executable is running with administrative privileges so replacing the executable gives an attacker admin privileges."
