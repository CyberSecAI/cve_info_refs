- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing sanitization of user-controlled input in the central management web application. Specifically, the `job_id` search parameter is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (CWE-89). The application is vulnerable to boolean-based blind SQL injection and time-based blind SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Allows an authenticated user to extract data from the underlying database. Exploitation is limited to read access due to the database user's permissions and lack of support for stacked queries.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending crafted GET requests to the central management web application's message tracking endpoint, specifically targeting the `job_id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have authenticated access to the central management web application. Low privileged roles such as "monitor" are sufficient for exploitation.
