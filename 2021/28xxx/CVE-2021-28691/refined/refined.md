{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A malicious or buggy network PV frontend can force Linux netback to disable the interface and terminate the receive kernel thread associated with queue 0 in response to the frontend sending a malformed packet. Such kernel thread termination will lead to a use-after-free in Linux netback when the backend is destroyed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS). A malicious or buggy frontend driver can trigger a dom0 crash. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out.",

      "A malicious or buggy network PV frontend can force Linux netback to disable the interface and terminate the receive kernel thread."
