Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28904:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a NULL pointer dereference in the `ext_get_plugin` function. Specifically, the `revision` argument of this function can be NULL, which leads to a crash when `strcmp` is called on the NULL pointer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- NULL Pointer Dereference: The code doesn't handle the case where the `revision` argument to `ext_get_plugin` is NULL, resulting in a dereference of this NULL pointer by `strcmp`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The crash caused by the NULL pointer dereference leads to a denial of service condition, as the application using the vulnerable `libyang` library will terminate unexpectedly.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious YANG Module: An attacker can craft a specially crafted YANG module that, when parsed by `libyang`, triggers the vulnerable code path by passing a NULL `revision` argument to the `ext_get_plugin` function. The provided example module contains extension statements that trigger the vulnerability when parsed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to Provide Input: An attacker needs to be able to supply the vulnerable `libyang` library with a malicious YANG module.
- No Privilege Required: The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing process; no special privilege is required for exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in `libyang` versions prior to 1.0.236.
- The issue was identified through a bug report ([#1451](https://github.com/CESNET/libyang/issues/1451)) on the libyang GitHub repository.
- The vulnerability was fixed by correcting the NULL pointer handling. The fix is referenced in the commit `59a0bff1a5a2f0a0eac07e4bf94d4aea9dd3708d`.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 202107-54) indicates this is a remote exploitable vulnerability.
