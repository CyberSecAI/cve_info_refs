Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-28967:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way MATLAB for Visual Studio Code handles workspace settings, specifically the path to the linter. The application did not restrict the scope of the linter path configuration property, allowing a workspace configuration to override the settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The core issue is that the extension allowed workspace-level settings to override the linter path, which should have been restricted to the user's machine scope. This lack of proper access control allowed a malicious workspace configuration to specify an arbitrary executable as the linter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By crafting a malicious workspace configuration that pointed the linter path to a malicious executable, an attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine when the workspace was opened in VS Code using the vulnerable extension.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Crafted Workspace Configuration:** An attacker would need to create or modify a workspace configuration file (typically a JSON file in a `.vscode` directory) to include a malicious path for the linter executable.
*   **Victim Opens Malicious Workspace:** The victim would need to open the workspace containing the crafted configuration file in Visual Studio Code using the vulnerable version of the MATLAB extension.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Create/Modify Workspace Configuration:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the content of a workspace configuration file that the victim would then open. This could be achieved by sharing a specially crafted project via online repositories, email, or other means.
*  **No specific network access needed**: The attacker does not need direct network access to the victim's machine. The vulnerability is triggered when the user opens a workspace with the malicious configuration.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.0.1 of the MATLAB for Visual Studio Code extension by setting the scope of the `mlintpath` property to machine scope, meaning that workspace configuration could no longer override this setting.

*   The commit `fc5dc53397677464099e80629e785a25718bf5ec` on the GitHub repository `Gimly/vscode-matlab` addresses this vulnerability by changing the scope of the configuration property `matlab.mlintpath` from `window` to `machine` in the `package.json` file.
