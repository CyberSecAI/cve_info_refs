{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The extension \"VHS: Fluid ViewHelpers\" is vulnerable to blind SQL Injection because user input is passed to the `isLanguageViewHelper` without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from the database, or modify data if the database user has sufficient privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating user input passed to the `isLanguageViewHelper`",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to pass malicious input to the vulnerable view helper. No prior authentication is needed in this case."
