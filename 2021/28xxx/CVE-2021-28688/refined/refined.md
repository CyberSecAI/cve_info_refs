Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-28688:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The fix for CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365) introduced a flaw in the `blkback` driver, specifically how it manages persistent grants in the Xen hypervisor. The fix over-initialized pointers, which could lead to the driver skipping cleanup of some grants and causing a resource leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Resource leak (specifically, a persistent grant leak) in the `blkback` driver.
- Failure to properly cleanup resources after a guest domain terminates.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) on the host system by resource exhaustion. The leak of persistent grants prevents full cleanup after a guest dies, resulting in "zombie domains" that use resources without being available. A malicious guest could repeatedly trigger this to exhaust host resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious or buggy guest using a frontend driver, can trigger the resource leak on the host by interacting with the `blkback` backend driver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a malicious guest with the ability to interact with the affected `blkback` driver on the host system.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is specifically related to the Xen hypervisor and its interaction with the Linux kernel's `blkback` driver.
- The vulnerability is present in all Linux versions that include the fix for XSA-365.
- Mitigations include using alternative backends (e.g., qemu-based) or disabling persistent grants on the `xen-blkback` driver via the module option "feature\_persistent=0".
- The fix for CVE-2021-28688/XSA-371 has been backported to Linux versions 3.11 and later.
