  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists within the handling of server-side controls. By specifying a control using a non-canonical string, an unsafe server-side control can be instantiated.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper handling of server-side controls",
    "Instantiation of unsafe server-side control via non-canonical string"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the service account.",
  "Attack vectors": "Specifying a control using a non-canonical string.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the server."
