Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2021-28796:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `Qiita::Markdown` library when processing iframe tags. Specifically, the library was not properly handling `javascript:` URLs within the `src` attribute of iframe elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting):** The core weakness is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The library fails to sanitize the `src` attribute of iframe tags, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of a victim's browser when they view content rendered with the vulnerable `Qiita::Markdown` library.
- This can lead to various impacts, such as:
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through crafted markdown input that includes an iframe tag with a `javascript:` URL in its `src` attribute.
- This malicious markdown can be injected through any channel that allows users to post content which then is rendered by `Qiita::Markdown`, such as comments, forum posts, or any other form that uses this library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to inject markdown content that will be processed by a system using the vulnerable version of `Qiita::Markdown`
- No special privileges or specific position is needed to conduct the attack, apart from the ability to post/inject crafted markdown code.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.33.0 of the library, which included changes to the transformers to avoid XSS.
- The fix also addresses `URI::InvalidError` handling, which may be related, though it's not the main XSS vector.
