Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-28048:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an "overly permissive CORS Policy" in Devolutions Server. This means the server allows Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requests from any domain, regardless of origin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure CORS Policy:** The server's CORS policy is too broad, allowing requests from any origin. This is a direct violation of the principle of least privilege.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Potential:** An attacker can potentially craft malicious web pages to make API requests to Devolutions Server on behalf of a victim who visits that web page while being authenticated on the legitimate application.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Depending on the API, an attacker may be able to read, modify or delete sensitive data or configurations by sending requests to the Devolutions Server API
*   **Account Takeover:** Under certain circumstances, attackers might be able to perform actions on behalf of a legitimate user, potentially leading to account takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker hosts a malicious web page.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The victim, while logged into Devolutions Server, visits the attacker's malicious web page.
*   **Cross-Origin API Request:** The malicious website sends API requests to the victim's Devolutions Server instance without the victim's direct interaction

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **External Position:** The attacker can be located anywhere on the internet.
*   **No Special Access to Devolutions Server:** The attacker does not require direct access to the server to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attack requires a victim to visit the malicious webpage while being authenticated on the Devolutions Server.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided text provides a good summary and more detail than the basic CVE description (PLACEHOLDER). It outlines the specific vulnerability, its cause, and the required steps for remediation.
*   The provided CVSS score (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N) highlights the high severity and impact.

It should be noted that successful exploitation requires user interaction. If the user is not logged into the vulnerable Devolutions Server when visiting the malicious website, then the attack will not be successful.
