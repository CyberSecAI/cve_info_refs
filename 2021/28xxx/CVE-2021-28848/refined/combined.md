=== Content from mintty.github.io_e9d1a260_20250115_100323.html ===

Mintty is a [terminal emulator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator)
for [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com),
[MSYS](https://web.archive.org/web/20210101000000%2A/mingw.org/wiki/MSYS) or
[Msys2](https://github.com/msys2), and derived projects,
and for [WSL](https://github.com/mintty/wsltty).

---

### Features

![](mintty-logo.svg)
*Terminal display features*

* [Xterm](http://invisible-island.net/xterm)-compatible terminal emulation, coverage of all DEC terminal series screen control features.* 256 colours and True-Colour support, optional CMYK colour specification.* Full Unicode support, comprehensive character encoding support and wide character handling.* Bidirectional rendering, flexible bidi controls.* Full character attributes support, including italic, underline styles and colours, overline, strikeout, rapid blinking.* Extended character attributes support: shadowed, subscript, superscript (terminfo) and overstrike.* Alternative fonts: simultaneous display of multiple fonts.* Secondary fonts: script-specific alternative font usage.* Reflow option on terminal resize (re-breaking of wrapped lines).* [Image](#image) display support.* [Sixel](#sixel) graphics support.* Full [emoji](#emoji) support, including all emoji sequences.* [Tektronix 4014](#tek) vector graphics emulation.

*Terminal input and interaction features*

*Configuration features and system support*

* Native Windows user interface with a lean [options dialog](#options).* User interface language localization support.* User-defined key shortcuts and menu functions.* Flexible configuration and resource folder options.* Options stored in a text file. No registry entries.* Switchable terminal logging, switchable character information.* Runs in Cygwin, MSYS(2), midipix. Also hosting WSL.* Runs on Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 10.

#### Compatibility

Mintty works on all Windows versions from Windows XP onwards.
Similarly to other Cygwin/MSYS terminals based on
[pseudo terminal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo_terminal)
("pty") devices, Windows console input/output
(as used by native Windows command-line programs)
has interworking problems with "pty" mode (most notably character set,
but also character-wise input and signal processing incompatibilities, see
[input/output interaction](https://github.com/mintty/mintty/wiki/Tips#inputoutput-interaction-with-alien-programs)).
Cygwin 3.1.0 compensates for this issue via the ConPTY API of Windows 10.

| System Build Last version tested| Windows 2000 Professional MSYS 1.0.19, gcc 3.4.4 3.7.7| Windows XP Professional 64-bit cygwin 2.5.2, gcc 5.4.0 3.7.7| Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit cygwin 3.2.0, gcc 11.2.0 3.7.7| Windows 7 Professional 64-bit cygwin 3.4.10, gcc 11.4.0 3.7.7| Windows 10 cygwin 3.5.5, gcc 15.0.0 3.7.7| Windows 11 cygwin 3.5.5, gcc 12.4.0 3.7.7 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

### Documentation

The Cygwin package ships with a manual page that can be accessed with `[man mintty](mintty.1.html)`.
Invoking mintty with the `--help` option shows a summary of available command line options.
See the [Wiki](https://github.com/mintty/mintty/wiki)
for information on keycodes, control sequences and other
[hints](https://github.com/mintty/mintty/wiki/Tips).
#### Configuration

Mintty settings can be given with its invocation as command-line options
or in a configuration file. Locations for configuration files as well as
settings with their default values are described in the
[mintty manual page](mintty.1.html).
#### Installation

In Cygwin, it is installed as the default "Cygwin Terminal".

For MSYS2, mintty is installed by default, or it can be installed later
with the command `pacman -S mintty`.

In Git-for-Windows, mintty is installed by default and invoked as "Git Bash".

For MSYS (old), select the msys-mintty package in the installer.
(Or from MinGW, install the package with `mingw-get install mintty`.)
#### Build

Building mintty on cygwin needs packages `gcc-core` and `make`.
To compile, go into subdirectory `src` and run `make`.

To install just the binary (for testing), copy `mintty.exe` from subdirectory `bin` to an appropriate place.
To install the binary and resource files locally, run `make install`.
To install into a packaging directory, run `make DESTDIR=*pathto/stage* install`.

### Bugs and Enhancements

Please report bugs or suggest enhancements via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mintty/mintty/issues).
General Cygwin questions should be sent to the Cygwin mailing list,
preferably after [subscribing the list](https://cygwin.com/cygwin/lists.html#subscribe-unsubscribe).

Bugs that were reported to the previous repository at
[Google code](http://code.google.com/p/mintty/issues/list)
before June, 2015, have been migrated here.

* **Mind!** Before reporting an issue about character interaction with an application,
  please check the issue also with at least one other terminal (xterm, urxvt),
  and maybe the Cygwin Console.

  See also the hint in [Compatibility](#compatibility) above.

#### Contribution

If you consider to suggest a patch or contribute to mintty otherwise,
discuss your proposal in an issue first, or on the Cygwin mailing list,
or with the maintainer.

* **Repository policy:** No unsolicited pull requests!

---

### History

Mintty is based on code from [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty) [0.60](http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.60/putty-src.zip) by Simon Tatham and [team](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/team.html).
The program icon comes from [KDE's Konsole](http://konsole.kde.org).
Mintty ties directly into Cygwin/MSYS and leaves out PuTTY's networking functionality,
which is provided by packages such as [openssh](http://www.openssh.com) and [inetutils](http://www.gnu.org/software/inetutils) instead.
A number of PuTTY issues have been addressed (see Wiki).
#### Credits

People who have contributed significantly to mintty are mentioned on the Wiki
[Credits page](https://github.com/mintty/mintty/wiki/Credits).
