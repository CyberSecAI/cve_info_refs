Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28683:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a NULL pointer dereference when Envoy attempts to retrieve a textual description of an unknown TLS alert code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-476:**  NULL Pointer Dereference. Envoy tries to access a string representation of the TLS alert code using a pointer. If the code is unknown, this pointer is NULL, which leads to the crash.
- The vulnerability is caused by the usage of `std::string_view` which doesn't handle null pointers in the constructor. This issue wasn't present when `absl::string_view` was used.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS).  An attacker can cause Envoy to crash by sending a TLS alert with an unknown code.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: A remote attacker can send a malicious TLS alert to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to establish a TLS connection with the Envoy instance and send a crafted TLS alert message.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Envoy versions using C++17. Versions 1.15 and earlier are not affected because they used `absl::string_view`, which handles null pointers in its constructor, instead of `std::string_view`.
- Affected versions: 1.17.1, 1.16.2
- Patched versions: 1.18.0, 1.17.2, 1.16.3
