| Hi,  Great work! We did a security analysis on the app and found that the risky `ipcRenderer` is directly exposed to the unsafe renderer process. This may allow remote attackers to abuse sensitive methods in the (privileged) main process by crafting malicious IPC messages. Vulnerability Details The following code shows how a preload script exposes IPC.   [twinkle-tray/src/intro-preload.js](https://github.com/xanderfrangos/twinkle-tray/blob/16c4a71f03d231b198ee90c12af0f4c74a16b6b5/src/intro-preload.js#L39)  Line 39 in [16c4a71](/xanderfrangos/twinkle-tray/commit/16c4a71f03d231b198ee90c12af0f4c74a16b6b5)   |  | window.ipc = ipc | | --- | --- |      We do find exploitable IPC endpoints. e.g., If the attacker sends a malicious msg to `open-url` channel, he may execute arbitrary commands via `openExternal`.   [twinkle-tray/src/electron.js](https://github.com/xanderfrangos/twinkle-tray/blob/3871712aa819ad98e01c18da9cb6dbc828a1c50e/src/electron.js#L1314-L1316)  Lines 1314 to 1316 in [3871712](/xanderfrangos/twinkle-tray/commit/3871712aa819ad98e01c18da9cb6dbc828a1c50e)   |  | ipcMain.on('open-url', (event, url) => { | | --- | --- | |  | require("electron").shell.openExternal(url) | |  | }) |     Mitigation  * enforce security checks when receiving events on sensitive channels (e.g., check if received URL is legal before openExternal) * avoid directly exposing ipcRenderer to untrusted domains. |

| v1.13.4 has been released with a fix for this potential vulnerability. I now use a pre-defined list of URLs.  I am not aware of any way that IPC could be triggered from outside of Electron, and Twinkle Tray does not load any HTML/JS from external URLs (it's all contained in the distributed ASAR). But just in case it *is* possible to exploit, it's been fixed. Thanks again for pointing the vulnerability out. |
