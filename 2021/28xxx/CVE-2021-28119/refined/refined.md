- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application exposes the `ipcRenderer` object directly to the renderer process. This allows a malicious actor to send crafted IPC messages. Specifically, the `open-url` channel was vulnerable because it directly used the provided URL in `shell.openExternal` without sanitization, allowing arbitrary command execution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unsafe exposure of `ipcRenderer` to the renderer process and lack of sanitization of URL parameters passed to `shell.openExternal`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary command execution on the user's system.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending malicious IPC messages to the vulnerable `open-url` channel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft IPC messages and send them to the application, potentially through a vulnerability in the renderer process.
