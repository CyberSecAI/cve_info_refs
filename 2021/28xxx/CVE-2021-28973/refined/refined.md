- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The XML Import functionality of the Helix ALM Administration console uses an insecurely configured XML parser which allows for XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection due to a weakly configured XML parser that allows the use of inline DTDs and external entities.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the server's file system. In the provided example, the attacker was able to retrieve the content of `C:\Windows\win.ini`.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious XML file containing an external entity declaration that references a local file. The attacker then imports the XML file using the XML import functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the administration console and have the ability to upload/import an XML file.
