Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28792:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Swift Development Environment for VS Code allowing certain configuration settings within a workspace to be overridden. Specifically, the vulnerable settings involve paths to executables, allowing a malicious workspace configuration to specify arbitrary binaries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The extension lacked proper control over the workspace settings, allowing users to override settings related to executable paths.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By crafting a malicious workspace configuration, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the machine of a user who opens the workspace.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Crafted workspace configuration:** The attacker needs to create or modify a VS Code workspace configuration file to include malicious paths for the vulnerable settings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted workspace to the victim, typically through sending or sharing the malicious workspace with the user. The user must then open the workspace with the vulnerable version of the extension.
- The attacker does not need any privileged access to the user's system.

**Additional details:**

- The specific vulnerable configurations are: `sourcekit-lsp.serverPath`, `swift.languageServerPath`, `swift.path.sourcekite`, `swift.path.sourcekiteDockerMode`, `swift.path.swift_driver_bin`, `swift.path.shell`.
- The vulnerability was reported by @Ry0taK.
- The issue was fixed in version 2.12.1 by preventing the vulnerable configurations from being overridden in workspaces.
