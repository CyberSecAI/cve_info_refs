  "vulnerability_details": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of FLAC files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Out-of-bounds write",
    "Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data"
  ],
  "impact": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user at low integrity.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Visiting a malicious page",
    "Opening a malicious file"
  ],
  "required_capabilities": "User interaction is required (opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious page). The attacker needs to craft a malicious FLAC file.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of FLAC files, leading to an out-of-bounds write."
