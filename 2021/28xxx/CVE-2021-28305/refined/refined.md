- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Misuse of the `sqlite3_column_name` function in the `diesel::SqliteConnection::query_by_name` function. The function returns a string pointer that becomes invalid after the first call to `sqlite3_step()`, but the code stores this pointer as a string slice for later use.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free vulnerability. The program attempts to use a string slice that refers to memory that has been freed or reallocated.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability can lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution. It has a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** Network
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special privileges or user interaction are required for the attack, and it can be triggered remotely over the network.
