Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28682:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An integer overflow occurs when processing very large `grpc-timeout` values. This overflow leads to undefined behavior in the timeout calculation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow (CWE-190).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
- A remote attacker can send a very large value for `grpc-timeout` to trigger the integer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Envoy proxy with a controllable `grpc-timeout` header. This can be done remotely.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Envoy versions 1.17.1, 1.16.2, 1.15.3, and 1.14.6.
- Patched versions are 1.18.0, 1.17.2, 1.16.3, 1.15.4, and 1.14.7.
- There was no mitigation other than upgrading to a patched version.
