Subject: CVE-2021-28125: Apache Superset Open Redirect

Description:

Apache Superset up to and including 1.0.1 allowed for the creation of
an external URL that could be malicious. By not checking user input
for open redirects the URL shortener functionality would allow for a
malicious user to create a short URL for a dashboard that could
convince the user to click the link.

Mitigation:

Upgrade to 1.1.0 or above
