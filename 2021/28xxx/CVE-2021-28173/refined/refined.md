Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-28173:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an unrestricted file upload function within the workflow platform. This function lacks proper validation and restrictions on the types of files that can be uploaded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The core vulnerability is the absence of file type restrictions in the upload mechanism. This means that an attacker can upload files with any extension they choose.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a file with a malicious executable extension (e.g., .jsp, .php, .exe), an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the workflow server. This gives the attacker the ability to run any commands and take full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated Upload Function:** The upload function is accessible without any authentication, meaning that an attacker doesn't need to log in or have any credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
- **File Upload:** The attack vector is the file upload functionality itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require any prior access or privileges to exploit this vulnerability. They can be an external, unauthenticated user of the workflow platform.
- The attacker only needs to access the vulnerable upload functionality within the application.
