Short description of vulnerabilities that was found in ASUS GPUTweak II utility

 [Raw](/DStraghkov/fba4994ac4bb3a6e2940b21743563df0/raw/843d6964196d1187754b79d472210ffc7a869ac4/Description.md)

# Short description of find vulnerabilities in AsIO2\_64.sys and AsIO2\_32.sys

## Incorrect Access Control in AsIO2\_64.sys and AsIO2\_32.sys

### Description

AsIO2\_64.sys and AsIO2\_32.sys in ASUS GPUTweak II before 2.3.0.3 allow low-privileged users to interact directly with physical memory (by
calling one of several driver routines that map physical memory into the virtual address space of the calling process) and to interact with
MSR registers. This could enable low-privileged users to achieve NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges via a DeviceIoControl.

### Vulnerability Type

Incorrect Access Control

### Vendor of Product

ASUS

### Affected Product Code Base

ASUS GPUTweak II - Affected before version - 2.3.0.3. Fixed from version - 2.3.0.3

### Affected Component

Driver AsIO2\_64.sys, AsIO2\_32.sys

### Attack Type

Local

### Impact Escalation of Privileges

True

### Attack Vectors

Run specially compiled PE format file.

### Discoverer

Ivannikov Institute for System Programming of the RAS

## Stack buffer overflow in AsIO2\_64.sys and AsIO2\_32.sys

### Description

AsIO2\_64.sys and AsIO2\_32.sys in ASUS GPUTweak II before 2.3.0.3 allow low-privileged users to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow. This
could enable low-privileged users to achieve Denial of Service via a DeviceIoControl.

### Vulnerability Type

Buffer Overflow

### Vendor of Product

ASUS

### Affected Product Code Base

ASUS GPUTweak II - Affected before version - 2.3.0.3. Fixed from version - 2.3.0.3

### Affected Component

Driver AsIO2\_64.sys, AsIO2\_32.sys

### Attack Type

Local

### Impact Denial of Service

True

### Attack Vectors

Run specially compiled PE format file.

### Discoverer

Ivannikov Institute for System Programming of the RAS
