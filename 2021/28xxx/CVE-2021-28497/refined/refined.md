Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
An internally found vulnerability in Arista's MOS (Metamako Operating System) allows unprivileged users to access the bash shell under certain conditions, where they should not have access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Inadequate access control for the bash shell within the MOS environment.
- Privilege escalation: Unprivileged users are able to gain access to a more powerful shell environment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  The impact is limited to "Low" integrity and availability impacts.
-  Potentially malicious actions from unprivileged users who gain unexpected access to the bash shell.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access to the affected device.
- Exploitation requires an already compromised system where the user has some level of access to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local (physical or remote) access to the device with an existing, but limited, user account.
- No specific, high-level privileges are needed for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Affected Products:**
- Arista 7130 Systems running MOS.
- Specific MOS versions:
    - All releases in the MOS-0.1x train.
    - MOS-0.26.6 and below releases in the MOS-0.2x train.
    - MOS-0.31.1 and below releases in the MOS-0.3x train.

**Unaffected Products:**
- Arista EOS-based products
- Arista Converged Cloud Fabric and DANZ Monitoring Fabric
- Arista Wireless Access Points
- CloudVision Wi-Fi (on-premise and cloud service delivery)
- CloudVision Portal, virtual appliance or physical appliance
- CloudVision as-a-Service
