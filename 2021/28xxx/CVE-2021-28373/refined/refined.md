- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `check_password` function was not being called when a user logged in with a correct OTP, effectively bypassing password authentication. This was due to an incorrect conditional check in the code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication bypass. The application incorrectly considered a valid OTP sufficient for login, regardless of the provided password.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain unauthorized access to a user's account by providing a valid OTP, even with an incorrect password. This bypasses the regular password authentication mechanism.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs a valid username and a valid OTP for that user. The attack vector is the login form of the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must know the username and have access to the user's OTP (e.g., by compromising the OTP generation/storage mechanism, or through social engineering).
