Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-28705:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient error handling during Populate-on-Demand (PoD) operations in the Xen hypervisor, specifically during page removal.
*   When a guest requests to remove a range of pages, the hypervisor might split this request into smaller chunks.
*   If a partial failure occurs during this chunked removal process, the hypervisor does not properly account for it, leading to inconsistencies.
* A similar issue exists with the insertion of new pages (CVE-2021-28709), and both are addressed in the same patch.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inadequate Error Handling:** The core weakness is the hypervisor's failure to handle partial successes in PoD page removal and insertion operations, specifically when the removal/insertion is broken into smaller steps.
*   **Missing Partial Success Accounting:** The hypervisor doesn't correctly track or react to situations where only a portion of a requested memory operation succeeds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious or buggy guest kernel can exploit this to mount a DoS attack, potentially affecting the entire system.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Possible):** Although not definitively confirmed, the advisory states that privilege escalation cannot be ruled out.
*    **Information Leaks (Possible):** Similar to privilege escalation, the advisory notes that information leaks are also a possibility.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Guest Kernel:** A malicious guest OS is required to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Specific PoD Setup:** The guest needs to be started in populate-on-demand (PoD) mode, indicated by a `maxmem` value larger than the `memory` value in the guest configuration.
*   **Targeted Hypercalls:** The attack is carried out by leveraging hypercalls that allow guests to control certain aspects of their P2M (physical to machine) mappings. Specifically calls that handle the removal and insertion of memory pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Guest Control:** The attacker needs to have control over a guest virtual machine.
*   **PoD Configuration:** The guest must be configured to use populate-on-demand memory allocation.
*   **Knowledge of Hypercalls:** The attacker needs to be aware of the hypercalls related to page management.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects x86 HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine) and PVH (Paravirtualized Hardware) guests.
*   All Xen versions from 3.4 onwards are believed to be vulnerable. Versions 3.3 and older are not affected.
*   The fix involves properly accounting for partial successes in page removal and insertion during PoD operations.
*   Patches are provided for various Xen versions (4.12, 4.13, 4.14, 4.15 and unstable).
