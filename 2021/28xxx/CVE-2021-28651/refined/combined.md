# SQUID-2021:1 Denial of Service in URN processing

High

[yadij](/yadij)
published
GHSA-ch36-9jhx-phm4
May 10, 2021

## Package

Squid
(Squid)

## Affected versions

2.0-4.14, 5.0.1-5.0.5

## Patched versions

4.15, 5.0.6

## Description

Due to a buffer management bug Squid is vulnerable to a

Denial of service attack against the server it is operating on.

This attack is limited to proxies which attempt to resolve a

"urn:" resource identifier. Support for this resolving is enabled

by default in all Squid.

---

### Severity:

This problem allows a malicious server in collaboration with a

trusted client to consume arbitrarily large amounts of memory

on the server running Squid.

Lack of available memory resources impacts all services on the

machine running Squid. Once initiated the DoS situation will

persist until Squid is shutdown.

CVSS Score of 8.5

<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C/CR:X/IR:X/AR:H/MAV:N/MAC:L/MPR:N/MUI:R/MS:C/MC:X/MI:X/MA:H&version=3.1>

---

### Updated Packages:

#### This bug is fixed by Squid versions 4.15 and 5.0.6.

In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable

releases can be found in our patch archives:

#### Squid 4:

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/SQUID-2021_1.patch>

If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer

to the package vendor for availability information on updated

packages.

---

### Determining if your version is vulnerable:

Squid older than 3.5.28 have not been tested and should be assumed to be

vulnerable.

All Squid-4.x up to and including 4.14 are vulnerable.

All Squid-5.x up to and including 5.0.5 are vulnerable.

---

### Workaround:

Disable URN processing by the proxy. Add these lines to

squid.conf:

acl URN proto URN

http\_access deny URN

---

### Contact details for the Squid project:

For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions

of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary

package vendor.

If you install and build Squid from the original Squid sources

then the squid-users@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list is your

primary support point. For subscription details see

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html>.

For reporting of non-security bugs in the latest STABLE release

the squid bugzilla database should be used

<http://bugs.squid-cache.org/>.

For reporting of security sensitive bugs send an email to the

squid-bugs@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list. It's a closed

list (though anyone can post) and security related bug reports

are treated in confidence until the impact has been established.

More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Squid Caching Proxy Security Audit: 55 Vulnerabilities, 35 0days.

---

*From*: Joshua Rogers <megamansec () gmail com>

*Date*: Wed, 11 Oct 2023 09:55:57 +0200

```
Dear fulldisclosure,

Two and a half years ago an independent audit was performed on The Squid
Caching Proxy, which ultimately resulted in 55 vulnerabilities being
discovered in the project's C++ source code.

Although some of the issues have been fixed, the majority (35) remain
valid. The majority have not been assigned CVEs, and no patches or
workarounds are available. Some of the listed issues concern more than one
bug, which is why 45 issues are listed, despite there being 55
vulnerabilities in total (10 extra of the result of similar, but different
pathways to reproduce a vulnerability).

After two and a half years of waiting, I have decided to release the issues
publicly. The Squid Project is aware of this release.

The issues are listed below. Due to the sheer size of issues discovered,
technical details are not included in this email. However, breakdowns of
the code and proof-of-concepts can be found on GitHub:

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-24af72ff2c
2021-06-11 01:18:48.291831
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : squid
Product : Fedora 33
Version : 4.15
Release : 1.fc33
URL : <http://www.squid-cache.org>
Summary : The Squid proxy caching server
Description :
Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for Web clients,
supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects. Unlike traditional
caching software, Squid handles all requests in a single,
non-blocking, I/O-driven process. Squid keeps meta data and especially
hot objects cached in RAM, caches DNS lookups, supports non-blocking
DNS lookups, and implements negative caching of failed requests.

Squid consists of a main server program squid, a Domain Name System
lookup program (dnsserver), a program for retrieving FTP data
(ftpget), and some management and client tools.

From: Joshua Rogers <megamansec@...il.com>

Subject: Squid Caching Proxy Security Audit: 55 Vulnerabilities, 35 0days.

Dear oss-security,

Two and a half years ago an independent audit was performed on The Squid
Caching Proxy, which ultimately resulted in 55 vulnerabilities being
discovered in the project's C++ source code.

Although some of the issues have been fixed, the majority (35) remain
valid. The majority have not been assigned CVEs, and no patches or
workarounds are available. Some of the listed issues concern more than one
bug, which is why 45 issues are listed, despite there being 55
vulnerabilities in total (10 extra of the result of similar, but different
pathways to reproduce a vulnerability).

After two and a half years of waiting, I have decided to release the issues
publicly. The Squid Project is aware of this release.

The issues are listed below. Due to the sheer size of issues discovered,
technical details are not included in this email. However, breakdowns of
the code and proof-of-concepts can be found on GitHub:
<https://megamansec.github.io/Squid-Security-Audit/>

Package        : squid3
Version        : 3.5.23-5+deb9u7
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-28651 CVE-2021-28652 CVE-2021-31806 CVE-2021-31807
                 CVE-2021-31808 CVE-2021-33620

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Squid, a proxy caching
server.

CVE-2021-28651

    Due to a buffer-management bug, it allows a denial of service.
    When resolving a request with the urn: scheme, the parser leaks a
    small amount of memory. However, there is an unspecified attack
    methodology that can easily trigger a large amount of memory
    consumption.

CVE-2021-28652

    Due to incorrect parser validation, it allows a Denial of Service
    attack against the Cache Manager API. This allows a trusted client
    to trigger memory leaks that. over time, lead to a Denial of
    Service via an unspecified short query string. This attack is
    limited to clients with Cache Manager API access privilege.

CVE-2021-31806

    Due to a memory-management bug, it is vulnerable to a Denial of
    Service attack (against all clients using the proxy) via HTTP
    Range request processing.

CVE-2021-31807

    An integer overflow problem allows a remote server to achieve
    Denial of Service when delivering responses to HTTP Range
    requests. The issue trigger is a header that can be expected to
    exist in HTTP traffic without any malicious intent.

CVE-2021-31808

    Due to an input-validation bug, it is vulnerable to a Denial of
    Service attack (against all clients using the proxy). A client
    sends an HTTP Range request to trigger this.

CVE-2021-33620

    Remote servers to cause a denial of service (affecting
    availability to all clients) via an HTTP response. The issue
    trigger is a header that can be expected to exist in HTTP traffic
    without any malicious intent by the server.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
3.5.23-5+deb9u7.

We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.

We can just free the buffer after the loop AFAICT, but, ideally, that leaking buffer should be converted into SBuf, and the tokenizing loop iterating that buffer should be converted to use an SBuf Tokenizer.  Alternatively, the whole URN-handling code can be removed as too risky and neglected.  Quality fixes welcome! ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=5104#c2)  Alex Rousskov    2021-02-22 23:02:08 UTC  ``` Amos created a PR with the simple solution: <https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/pull/778> ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=5104#c3)  Amos Jeffries    2021-03-29 09:53:16 UTC  ``` PR merged ``` |  |

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-c0bec55ec7
2021-06-11 01:12:06.314182
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : squid
Product : Fedora 34
Version : 5.0.6
Release : 1.fc34
URL : <http://www.squid-cache.org>
Summary : The Squid proxy caching server
Description :
Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for Web clients,
supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects. Unlike traditional
caching software, Squid handles all requests in a single,
non-blocking, I/O-driven process. Squid keeps meta data and especially
hot objects cached in RAM, caches DNS lookups, supports non-blocking
DNS lookups, and implements negative caching of failed requests.

Squid consists of a main server program squid, a Domain Name System
lookup program (dnsserver), a program for retrieving FTP data
(ftpget), and some management and client tools.
