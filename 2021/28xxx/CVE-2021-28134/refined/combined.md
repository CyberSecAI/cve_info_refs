| Hi,  We found that `preload.js` introduces dangerous API openShellExternal for arbitrary access on unsafe renderer process. This may lead to remote command execution. We suggest that a URL check should be enforced at L15, which enforces an allowlist on trusted urls.     [clipper/preload.js](https://github.com/AkashRajpurohit/clipper/blob/d133fde04b4029d69626852206c328363657ad4d/preload.js#L14-L16)  Lines 14 to 16 in [d133fde](/AkashRajpurohit/clipper/commit/d133fde04b4029d69626852206c328363657ad4d)   |  | window.openExternalUrl = (url) => { | | --- | --- | |  | remote.shell.openExternal(url); | |  | }; | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Makes sense. A validUrl function which check against a list of urls can be a solution. If you are interested to add this, PRs are welcomed for it. I'll look into it. Thank you 😄 |
