- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Concurrent execution of a query by a less privileged user on the same coordinator node as a more privileged user could cause the query to be executed with higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Privilege escalation due to incorrect thread context handling.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain additional permissions against a restricted index, potentially accessing or modifying data they shouldn't be able to.
- **Attack vectors**: A user executes a query concurrently with another more privileged user on the same coordinator node.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a user with some level of access, and they need to be able to trigger a concurrent query execution with a more privileged user on the same coordinator node.
