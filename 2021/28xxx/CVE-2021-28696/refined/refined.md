  "cveId": "CVE-2021-28696",
  "related": true,
  "info": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in the Xen hypervisor related to IOMMU page mappings on x86 systems. Specifically, this CVE is about the vulnerability on AMD systems, where upon de-assignment of a physical device from a guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to anymore.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The Xen hypervisor fails to remove identity mappings of memory regions when a physical device is de-assigned from a guest.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper deallocation of memory mappings",
      "Inadequate privilege control"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability allows a guest to retain access to memory ranges that it should no longer have access to, potentially leading to privilege escalation, denial of service, or information leaks.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "A malicious guest, granted access to a physical device via PCI passthrough, exploits the vulnerability after the physical device is de-assigned.",
      "A guest that was trusted when a device was assigned and becomes untrusted after the device is removed."
     ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be a guest that has been granted access to a physical device via PCI passthrough. The hypervisor should be running on x86 with an IOMMU. Additionally, the ACPI tables should specify memory regions to be identity mapped."
