**Describe the Bug**

Hi,

Great work!

We did a security analysis and found that `app/lib/preload.js` directly expose risky ipcRenderer instance to unsafe renderer process, which enables a remote attacker to abuse sensitive methods in the main process by crafting malicious ipc message.

I notice that the app has already disabled node integration in unsafe renderers([92ba66d](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-modeler/commit/92ba66d3e7ae85130b71cf7fc869b2066aadf67f)), which is good. However, such direct IPC export may re-expose many sensitive primitives to the attacker.

Here is the exposure site.

[camunda-modeler/app/lib/preload.js](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-modeler/blob/a5874345f259188b39bd6b2448a64e238fa700bb/app/lib/preload.js#L27-L37)

Lines 27 to 37
in
[a587434](/camunda/camunda-modeler/commit/a5874345f259188b39bd6b2448a64e238fa700bb)

|  | window.getAppPreload = function() { |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | return { |
|  | metadata: app.metadata, |
|  | plugins: app.plugins.getAll(), |
|  | flags: app.flags.getAll(), |
|  | ipcRenderer, |
|  | platform |
|  | }; |
|  |  |
|  | }; |

By sending a message to `file:write` channel. The attacker may read and write malicious content to the user filesystem.

[camunda-modeler/app/lib/index.js](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-modeler/blob/6f1497c41917bc12bb2e44b3fa3c49b36f32ee72/app/lib/index.js#L186-L194)

Lines 186 to 194
in
[6f1497c](/camunda/camunda-modeler/commit/6f1497c41917bc12bb2e44b3fa3c49b36f32ee72)

|  | renderer.on('file:write', function(filePath, file, options = {}, done) { |
| --- | --- |
|  | try { |
|  | const newFile = writeFile(filePath, file, options); |
|  |  |
|  | done(null, newFile); |
|  | } catch (err) { |
|  | done(err); |
|  | } |
|  | }); |

**Expected Behavior**

I could think of two possible solutions:

* enforce security checks when receiving events on sensitive channels (e.g., file read/write).
* avoid directly exposing `ipcRenderer` to untrusted domains.
