- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `app/lib/preload.js` script directly exposes the `ipcRenderer` instance to the renderer process. This allows a malicious actor to craft IPC messages that trigger sensitive methods in the main process. Specifically, the `file:write` channel is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability stems from insecure exposure of the `ipcRenderer` object, which allows the renderer process to directly interact with main process functionality. This circumvents the intended security model by allowing a renderer to invoke operations that should be limited to main process. Specifically, the lack of security checks for file write operation allows arbitrary file system manipulation
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can manipulate the filesystem by sending a crafted message to the `file:write` channel, potentially leading to arbitrary file writes and reads. This could result in data loss, system compromise, or other malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious IPC message that is sent through the exposed `ipcRenderer` to the vulnerable `file:write` channel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the renderer process through the exposed `ipcRenderer` object. This could be achieved through a remote code execution vulnerability in the renderer, a malicious extension, or by compromising the application's code itself.
