- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Adobe After Effects.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L). The attack requires user interaction (UI:R) as the user needs to open a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open a specially crafted malicious file using the vulnerable version of Adobe After Effects. The attacker does not need any special privileges (PR:N).
