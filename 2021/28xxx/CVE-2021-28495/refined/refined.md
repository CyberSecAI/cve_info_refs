The provided content is related to CVE-2021-28495.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an issue in Arista's MOS (Metamako Operating System) software, specifically when API access is enabled via JSON-RPC APIs. Under certain conditions, user authentication can be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Authentication bypass vulnerability when API access is enabled using JSON-RPC APIs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass user authentication. This could potentially enable unauthorized access to the affected system, allowing for configuration changes, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. The provided CVSS score indicates that the impact is limited to low integrity and low availability concerns (C:N/I:L/A:L)

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited via network access.
- It affects systems where API access is enabled via JSON-RPC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the network where the vulnerable Arista 7130 system is located.
- The attacker does not require any prior authentication.
- They also need to interact with the JSON-RPC APIs.

**Affected Software:**
- MOS-0.13 and post releases in the MOS-0.1x train
- MOS-0.26.6 and prior releases in the MOS-0.2x train
- MOS-0.31.1 and prior releases in the MOS-0.3x train

**Affected Platforms:**
- Arista 7130 Systems running MOS

**Unaffected Products:**
- Arista EOS-based products
- Arista Converged Cloud Fabric and DANZ Monitoring Fabric
- Arista Wireless Access Points
- CloudVision Wi-Fi
- CloudVision Portal
- CloudVision as-a-Service
- Awake Security Platform

**Mitigation:**
- Disable API access on the affected systems using the command `management api shutdown`. This will break any automation relying on API access.

**Resolution:**
- Upgrade to the following fixed MOS versions:
    - MOS-0.26.7 and later releases
    - MOS-0.32.0 and later releases
- Apply the hotfix [SecurityAdvisory64-67-Hotfix-mos-1818-2.0.0-1.11.core2_64.rpm](https://www.arista.com/assets/data/SecurityAdvisories/SA64-67/SecurityAdvisory64-67-Hotfix-mos-1818-2.0.0-1.11.core2_64.rpm) for versions MOS-0.26.6 and below and MOS-0.31.1 and below.
