Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28903:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a recursive call to the `lyxml_parse_elem` function within the libyang library, triggered by deeply nested XML structures, specifically by a large number of nested `<base>` tags within a `<identity>` tag.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stack overflow:** The recursive calls without a proper limit lead to excessive consumption of stack memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The stack overflow causes the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious XML input:** An attacker can craft a specially designed XML file with a deeply nested structure that triggers the excessive recursion when parsed by `libyang`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply malicious XML input to an application that uses libyang. The attacker does not need to be in a privileged position.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was mitigated by adding a hard limit to the recursion depth. However, it's noted that very small stack sizes might still cause issues.
- The vulnerability was fixed by commit `298b30ea4ebee137226acf9bb38678bd82704582`
- Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 202107-54 addresses the CVE.
