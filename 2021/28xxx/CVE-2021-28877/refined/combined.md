# Rust: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **202210-09**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rust, the worst of which could result in denial of service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/rust** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.63.0-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.63.0-r1** |

| Package | **dev-lang/rust-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.64.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.64.0** |

### Background

A systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rust. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Please review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Rust users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/rust-1.63.0-r1"

```

All Rust binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/rust-bin-1.64.0"

```

In addition, users using Portage 3.0.38 or later should ensure that packages with Rust binaries have no vulnerable code statically linked into their binaries by rebuilding the @rust-rebuild set:

```
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose @rust-rebuild

```

I found this while working on improvements for TRA.

After partially consuming a Zip adapter and then wrapping it into another Zip where the adapters use their `TrustedRandomAccess` specializations leads to the outer adapter returning elements which should have already been consumed.

If the optimizer gets tripped up by the addition this might affect performance for chained `zip()` iterators even when the inner one is not partially advanced but it would require more extensive fixes to `TrustedRandomAccess` to communicate those offsets earlier.

Included test fails on nightly, [playground link](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=24fa1edf8a104ff31f5a24830593b01f)

Sorry, something went wrong.
