Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28960:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper handling of input commands in on-demand operations. Specifically, the vulnerability is related to how the software processes commands, making it susceptible to injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated Command Injection: An attacker can inject malicious commands into the system without needing to authenticate. This is due to the application's failure to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: By injecting commands, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable software. This could lead to full system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- On-demand operations: The vulnerability is located in the handling of operations that are executed on-demand, likely through an API or similar interface. The attacker is able to inject code via inputs to these on-demand operations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable component. This could be from the same network as the server or through a public-facing service.
- No Authentication Required: An attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Endpoint Central build 10.0.683
- The provided text specifically mentions that "Unauthenticated command injection due to improper handling of input command in on-demand operations has been fixed."
