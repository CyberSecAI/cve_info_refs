Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28807:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from two issues:

1.  **Reflected XSS:** The Q'center application doesn't properly sanitize user-controlled input in the login failure logs. Specifically, the failed login username is displayed without sanitization on the event logs page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code via a crafted username during a failed login attempt.
2. **Command Injection:** Q'center allows the upload and installation of QPKG packages. The system extracts and executes an initial script within the QPKG file using `/bin/sh`, without proper validation. By crafting a malicious QPKG package with a malicious initial script and a tar.gz archive, an attacker can achieve remote command execution on the Q'center instance.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of input sanitization in the log page allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Command Injection:** The QPKG installation process executes a script within the package, leading to arbitrary command execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** A successful XSS attack allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of a logged-in Q'center user. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, and other malicious activities on the Q'center application.
*   **Command Injection:** A successful command injection vulnerability allows a privileged attacker to achieve remote code execution on the Q'center instance, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** An unauthenticated attacker can trigger the XSS by attempting to log in with a specially crafted username that includes malicious JavaScript. When an administrator views the event log, this script is executed.
*   **Command Injection:** A privileged attacker can upload a crafted QPKG package through the Q'center interface. The malicious script within the package is then executed when Q'center attempts to install the package.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger a failed login attempt against the Q'center instance with a malicious username. No authentication is required, however, the malicious script is only executed if a user views the logs.
*   **Command Injection:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated and privileged user who has the ability to upload QPKG packages.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects QNAP NAS devices running Q'center.
*   Shielder identified the vulnerability in version 1.12.1014 of the QNAP Q'center Virtual Appliance.
*   QNAP has addressed this vulnerability in the following versions:
    *   QTS 4.5.3: Q’center v1.12.1012 and later
    *   QTS 4.3.6: Q’center v1.10.1004 and later
    *   QTS 4.3.3: Q’center v1.10.1004 and later
    *   QuTS hero h4.5.2: Q’center v1.12.1012 and later
    *   QuTScloud c4.5.4: Q’center v1.12.1012 and later

The provided content contains a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit on GitHub that combines the XSS and command injection vulnerabilities. The PoC involves crafting a malicious QPKG package with a reverse shell payload, and leveraging the stored XSS vulnerability to trigger the upload of the malicious package, resulting in remote command execution.
