RESPONSE:
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "If the `${jetty.base}` directory or the `${jetty.base}/webapps` directory is a symlink, the contents of the `${jetty.base}/webapps` directory may be deployed as a static web application, exposing the content of the directory for download.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability exists when a symlink is used for the `${jetty.base}` or `${jetty.base}/webapps` directories, leading to unintended deployment of the webapps directory content as a static web application.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information by allowing download of the contents of the webapps directory. It can also potentially lead to Denial of Service (DoS) as the exposed directory could be abused by a malicious actor.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the network, as the content is made available for download via the web server if symlinks are used.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only needs network access to exploit this vulnerability. No specific capabilities are needed besides the ability to request resources from the affected server."
