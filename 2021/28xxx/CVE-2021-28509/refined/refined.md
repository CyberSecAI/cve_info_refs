Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-28509:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Arista EOS's state streaming telemetry agent, TerminAttr, and the OpenConfig transport protocol, Octa, handle sensitive data. Under certain conditions, they can leak MACsec sensitive data in clear text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Data:** TerminAttr and Octa, when enabled and under specific circumstances, transmit MACsec data in cleartext. This violates the confidentiality principle and exposes sensitive information.
*   **Improper Credentials Management:** The core issue is categorized as "CWE-255 Credentials Management Errors", which indicates a failure to properly handle and protect security credentials which in this case are the MACsec keys.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Decryption of MACsec traffic:** Attackers who gain access to the leaked MACsec keys can decrypt and potentially modify MACsec-protected traffic, undermining the security and integrity of network communications.
*   **Compromise of Confidentiality and Integrity:** The leakage directly leads to a breach of confidentiality and a potential loss of integrity, as MACsec is designed to provide these security features.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to either CloudVision's authorized users or authorized gNMI clients.
*   **Passive Sniffing/Interception:** The attacker doesn't necessarily need to actively interact with the device; they can potentially passively intercept the cleartext MACsec data if they can access the telemetry stream.
*   **Access via CloudVision or gNMI:** The attacker can leverage access to a CloudVision user account or an authorized gNMI client, which then receives the leaked data in the telemetry stream.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authorized Access:** The attacker must have authorized access to either CloudVision or be an authorized gNMI client. This suggests that the vulnerability is more of an insider threat or a compromise of an authorized system.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable systems:** The attacker must be aware of the specific systems running vulnerable versions of TerminAttr or Octa, and with MACsec enabled.
*   **No need for Device access:**  The attacker does not need direct access to the affected switch as they would receive the data through gNMI or cloudvision.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Software:** The document lists affected EOS versions and TerminAttr versions, allowing for specific identification of vulnerable devices.
*   **Affected Platforms:** The document specifies which Arista platforms are affected, listing the specific series of switches vulnerable to the described issue. It also provides a list of Arista products not affected.
*   **Required Configurations:** The advisory clarifies that the vulnerability is only exploitable if TerminAttr or Octa are enabled, and MACsec is configured. The specific CLI commands are provided for enabling the services and the configurations required for MACsec.
*   **Mitigation Steps:** The document provides clear instructions to mitigate the vulnerabilities by disabling TerminAttr or Octa.
*   **Resolution:** The document lists the specific versions of EOS and TerminAttr where the vulnerability has been resolved by upgrading to patched versions.
