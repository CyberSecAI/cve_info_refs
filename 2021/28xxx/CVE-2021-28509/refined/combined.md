## Description

This advisory documents the impact of an internally found vulnerability in Arista EOS state streaming telemetry agent TerminAttr and OpenConfig transport protocols.

The impact of this vulnerability is that, in certain conditions, TerminAttr or Octa might leak IPsec (CVE-2021-28508) and MACsec (CVE-2021-28509) sensitive data in clear text to CloudVisions's authorized users or authorized gNMI clients. The leaked data could allow IPsec and MACsec traffic to be decrypted or modified.

This issue was discovered internally and Arista is not aware of any malicious uses of this issue in customer networks.

## **Vulnerability Assessment**

* Arista Converged Cloud Fabric and DANZ Monitoring Fabric (Formerly Big Switch Nodes for BCF and BMF)
* Awake Security Platform

## Required Configuration for Exploitation

The prerequisite for both CVEs is that TerminAttr or Octa is enabled on the device

TerminAttr is enabled on the device:

```
daemon TerminAttr
   exec /usr/bin/TerminAttr ...
   no shutdown

```

Octa is enabled on the device:

```
management api gnmi
   provider eos-native

```
### CVE-2021-28508

IPsec is configured on device:

```
ip security
   profile Arista
      ike-policy ikedefault
      sa-policy sadefault
      connection start
      shared-key 7 047A190F1C354D
      mode transport

```
### CVE-2021-28509

MACsec is configured on device:

```
mac security
   profile Arista
      key 0abc1234 7 06070E234E4D0A48544540585F507E
      key 0def5678 7 09484A0C1C0311475E5A527D7C7C70 fallback

interface Ethernet6/1
   mac security profile Arista

```
## Indicators of Compromise

### TerminAttr

When TerminAttr is used directly on the device to stream, check if TerminAttr is running with the affected version mentioned above.

To check the installed TerminAttr version on the system, use the following command:

```
#show version detail | grep TerminAttr-core
TerminAttr-core      v1.13.3         1

```

To check if TerminAttr is running, use the following command and make sure  there's a PID allocated to the process:

```
#show daemon TerminAttr
Process: TerminAttr (running with PID 2430)

```
### Octa

When Octa is used on the device to stream for OpenConfig modeled data and "eos-native" data over the gNMI, check if Octa is enabled on the device.

To check if Octa is running on the device, use the following show command to check Octa status:

```
#show management api gnmi
Octa:               enabled
Enabled:            Yes
Server:             running on port 6030, in default VRF
SSL Profile:        none
QoS DSCP:           none

```
## **Mitigation**

The following configuration changes may be made in order to mitigate the exploitation of the listed vulnerability.

On the affected versions, the vulnerabilities can be mitigated by disabling the streaming agent in use on the device.

### TerminAttr

```
daemon TerminAttr
   shutdown

```
### Octa

```
management api gnmi
   no provider eos-native

```
## Resolution

The recommended resolution is to upgrade to a remediated software version at your earliest convenience.

#### CVE-2021-28508

The vulnerability is fixed in the following versions:

**EOS versions:** (When Octa is in use on the device) :

* 4.24.10 and later release in the 4.24.x train
* 4.25.8 and later releases in the 4.25.x train
* 4.26.6 and later releases in the 4.26.x train
* 4.27.2 and later releases in the 4.27.x train

**TerminAttr versions:**

* TerminAttr v1.10.11 and later releases in the v1.10.x train
* TerminAttr v1.16.8 and later releases in the v1.16.x train
* TerminAttr v1.19.0 and later releases

#### CVE-2021-28509

The vulnerability is fixed in the following versions:

**EOS versions** (When Octa is in use on the device) :

* 4.24.10 and later release in the 4.24.x train
* 4.25.8 and later releases in the 4.25.x train
* 4.26.6 and later releases in the 4.26.x train
* 4.27.4 and later releases in the 4.27.x train

**TerminAttr versions:**

* TerminAttr v1.10.11 and later releases
* TerminAttr v1.16.8 and later releases in the v1.11.x-v1.16.x trains
* TerminAttr v1.19.2 and later releases in the v1.17.x-v1.19.x trains

As mentioned above, TerminAttr has been bundled with every EOS release from 4.17.0F and above and it’s also available as a SWIX extension that can be used to upgrade TerminAttr to the latest version independently. For instructions on upgrading TerminAttr to the fixed release from CLI on EOS-based products, please refer to the article [TerminAttr – Upgrade & Downgrade](https://arista.my.site.com/AristaCommunity/s/article/terminattr-upgrade-downgrade).

An EOS upgrade is required only when Octa is in use.

### Hotfix

No hotfix is available for these CVEs.
