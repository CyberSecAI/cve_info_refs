Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28855:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the `dbuf_write` function of Deark. This occurs when processing specially crafted input files that trigger a specific code path related to ICC profile extraction within the `pict.c` module. Specifically, the issue lies within how the `iccprofile_file` is handled, where it can be NULL under certain circumstances. When a write operation is then attempted using `dbuf_copy` with this NULL pointer, it leads to a dereference, causing a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is the possibility of dereferencing a NULL pointer. The code does not properly handle the case where `d->iccprofile_file` is NULL before attempting to copy data into it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit results in a program crash, effectively causing a denial of service. An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by providing a crafted input file, rendering Deark unable to process files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted input file that is processed by Deark, triggering the vulnerable code path. The specifics of the file format (likely related to picture/image processing) are exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker must be able to provide the specially crafted input file to Deark. This could be through command-line arguments or any other means by which Deark accepts input.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The commit `287f5ac31dfdc074669182f51ece637706070eeb` on GitHub fixes this issue.
*   The vulnerability was found by Fatih Ã‡elik.
*   The vulnerable function is `dbuf_write`, located in `src/deark-dbuf.c:1376`.
*   The vulnerable code is within the `do_iccprofile_item` function of `modules/pict.c`.
*   The fix prevents copying to the `iccprofile_file` if it is `NULL`.
*   The issue exists in Deark version 1.5.7-1.
