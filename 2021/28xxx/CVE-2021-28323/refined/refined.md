{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a case-sensitivity issue in the validation of scratch directory paths within the Microsoft Diagnostics Hub Standard Collector Service. The service uses `GetFinalPathNameByHandleW` to resolve the final path of a directory and compares it to the user-supplied path using `wcsnicmp` which is case-insensitive. However, the NTFS file system can be configured to be case-sensitive which allows the bypass.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Directory traversal vulnerability due to case-insensitive comparison of paths.",
    "Lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied paths.",
    "Use of a case-insensitive string comparison (`wcsnicmp`) when a case-sensitive comparison is required in some configurations.",
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation could lead to deletion of arbitrary files, dropping of files outside the designated scratch directory, and taking over file permissions, resulting in elevation of privileges to NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the Diagnostics Hub Standard Collector Service DCOM class, which is accessible to all users. The attacker provides a crafted directory path containing junctions (like symlinks) with different casing to bypass the path validation.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have access to the Diagnostics Hub Standard Collector Service and the ability to create specific directory structures and junctions, which could be achieved with a standard user account if Windows Subsystem for Linux or Docker Desktop (or another mechanism) is used to enable case-sensitivity per directory.",
   "CVE IDs": ["CVE-2021-28321", "CVE-2021-28322", "CVE-2021-28323"]
