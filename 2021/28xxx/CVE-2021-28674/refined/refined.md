- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Broken access control. An authenticated user with node management rights for one group can delete nodes from a different group.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control, specifically, node management rights were not properly scoped.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with node management rights for a specific group can delete nodes belonging to other groups, potentially causing disruption of service by removing monitored resources.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack, requiring an authenticated user with node management permissions on the affected SolarWinds Orion Platform.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with node management rights within the Orion Platform. The attacker also needs access to the system through the network.
