Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28131:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Impala sessions use a 16-byte secret for verification to prevent session hijacking.
- These session secrets are written to Impala logs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Exposure of sensitive information: Session secrets are logged, making them accessible to users with access to the logs.
- Session hijacking: An attacker who gains access to the logs can use the leaked secrets to hijack another authenticated user's sessions.
- Privilege escalation: By hijacking a session of a user with higher privileges, an attacker can perform actions they aren't normally authorized to do.
- Incorrect audit logging: Actions performed via a hijacked session will be logged under the name of the legitimate user whose session was hijacked, which will lead to incorrect audit trails.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized execution of statements: Attackers can execute statements they don't have the privileges to execute by hijacking sessions of privileged users.
- Privilege escalation: Attackers can gain higher privileges than they are normally granted.
- Data breaches: Depending on the privileges of the hijacked user, sensitive data could be accessed and possibly exfiltrated
- Inaccurate audit trails: Makes identifying malicious activities and holding users accountable difficult.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Access to Impala logs: The attacker must have access to the logs where session secrets are written.
- Knowledge of Impala's session handling: The attacker needs to be able to construct specially crafted requests to utilize hijacked sessions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated Impala User: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of Impala.
- Access to Impala logs:  The attacker must have access to the Impala logs.
- Technical Sophistication:  The attacker needs to possess a high degree of technical skill to construct the necessary attack.
