- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `data-secret-value` attribute in the `ClientSecret` and `ApiResourceSecret` views was not HTML encoded. This allowed for the possibility of injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS). Specifically, the lack of HTML encoding of user-controlled data (secret values) within the HTML attribute `data-secret-value`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser. This could allow an attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, perform actions on behalf of the user, or redirect the user to a malicious site.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript into a secret value. This injected value would then be placed into the `data-secret-value` attribute when the page is rendered, leading to the execution of the injected code when the dialog with the secret is shown.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to somehow influence/modify the secret value stored within the application. This could be through exploiting other vulnerabilities that allow for data manipulation or by being an authenticated user with sufficient privileges to create or modify the secrets.
