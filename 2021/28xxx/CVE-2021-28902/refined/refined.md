Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28902:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by a NULL pointer dereference in the `read_yin_container` function of the libyang library. Specifically, the code attempts to access `retval->ext[r]->flags` without checking if `retval->ext[r]` is NULL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- NULL pointer dereference

**Impact of exploitation:**

-  A crash due to the NULL pointer dereference, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a crafted YANG model file (YIN format). The provided example in the github issue shows a specially crafted `<module>` with nested containers and leaves having long names containing specific characters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious YANG model to be parsed by a vulnerable libyang application.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was reported on March 8, 2021, and fixed shortly after.
- The fix was included in commit `a3917d95d516e3de267d3cfa5d4d3715a90e8777`
- The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 202107-54) indicates that versions of `net-libs/libyang` prior to 1.0.236 are affected.
