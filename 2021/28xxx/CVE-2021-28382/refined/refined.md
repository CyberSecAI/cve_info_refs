Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2021-28382 vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization/escaping of user details fields when importing user data from Active Directory into ManageEngine Key Manager Plus. Specifically, the first name, last name, and email fields are affected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Malicious HTML, specifically JavaScript code, injected into the user details fields are not properly encoded/escaped before being rendered in the web interface. This allows the malicious code to be executed within the context of the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they visit the `/apiclient/index.jsp#/Settings/UserManagement` page.
- **Cookie Theft:** As demonstrated in the provided proof-of-concept, the attacker could steal user cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious activities.
- **Other Malicious Actions:**  The attacker could redirect the user to malicious sites, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deface the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Active Directory User Import:** An attacker would need to modify the first name, last name or email field of an Active Directory user object such that the fields contain malicious HTML/JavaScript. When the ManageEngine Key Manager Plus imports this user via Active Directory synchronization, the malicious script is saved.
- **Web Browser:** The malicious script executes in the context of a user's browser when they visit the vulnerable page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Active Directory Access:** The attacker must have the ability to modify user details (specifically, first name, last name, or email fields) within the Active Directory instance.
- **User Interaction:** The victim needs to visit the vulnerable user management page within Key Manager Plus `/apiclient/index.jsp#/Settings/UserManagement` for the stored XSS payload to execute.

**Affected Versions:**
- ManageEngine Key Manager Plus Version 6000 (6.0.0) and any version below 6001 when importing users from Active Directory are vulnerable.

**Remediation:**
- Upgrade to ManageEngine Key Manager Plus version 6001 or later.
