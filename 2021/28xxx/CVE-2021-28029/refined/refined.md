- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When inserting rows from an iterator, `toodee` shifts existing items to make space for the new row, but duplicates ownership of the elements during the shift. The space reserved for new elements is based on `len()` of the `ExactSizeIterator`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Double free: If the iterator panics, elements in the array could be freed twice due to duplicated ownership.
    - Use of uninitialized/previously freed memory: If the `len()` returned by the iterator does not match the actual number of elements, uninitialized or previously freed elements could be exposed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory corruption, including double frees and exposure of uninitialized/freed memory.
- **Attack vectors**: Inserting rows using an iterator with `toodee::TooDee::insert_row`. The iterator could potentially panic or return a `len()` that doesn't correspond to the actual number of elements.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to provide an iterator to the `toodee::TooDee::insert_row` function in a way that causes the issues described (panicking or returning a mismatched len).
