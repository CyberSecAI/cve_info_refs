Based on the provided content, this advisory RUSTSEC-2021-0038 covers multiple memory safety issues in the `fltk` crate, and it includes CVE-2021-28308 as one of the aliases.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in insufficient checks and improper handling of image data within the `fltk` library, leading to potential null pointer dereferences and out-of-bounds reads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **NULL pointer dereference:** Occurs when setting a multi label type with a non-existent image and when setting a window icon with a non-raster image.
*   **Out-of-bounds read:** Happens in the `Pixmap` constructor due to lack of proper validation of pixmap data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The vulnerabilities can lead to:
*   Program crashes due to NULL pointer dereferences.
*   Potential information leaks or other undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds reads.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Exploiting the `set_label_type` function with invalid image data.
*   Setting window icons using non-rasterized images.
*   Providing malformed or invalid data to the `Pixmap` constructor

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   An attacker needs the ability to influence the input data to the vulnerable functions within the `fltk` library. This could involve user interaction with a vulnerable application using the library or by manipulating data provided to it.
