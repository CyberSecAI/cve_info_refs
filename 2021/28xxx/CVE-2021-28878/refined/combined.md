Fixes [#82291](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82291)

It's open for review, but conflicts with [#82289](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/82289), wait before merging. The conflict involves only the new test, so it should be rather trivial to fix.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Rust: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **202210-09**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rust, the worst of which could result in denial of service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/rust** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.63.0-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.63.0-r1** |

| Package | **dev-lang/rust-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.64.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.64.0** |

### Background

A systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rust. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Please review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Rust users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/rust-1.63.0-r1"

```

All Rust binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/rust-bin-1.64.0"

```

In addition, users using Portage 3.0.38 or later should ensure that packages with Rust binaries have no vulnerable code statically linked into their binaries by rebuilding the @rust-rebuild set:

```
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose @rust-rebuild

```

## Description

![@SkiFire13](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9020423?u=d0ce7486e9b05e2564d23eca411832e5eda37383&v=4&size=48)[SkiFire13](https://github.com/SkiFire13)opened [on Feb 19, 2021](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82291#issue-812063911)

Here `__iterator_get_unchecked` is called for potential side effects until `self.index == self.a.size()`, ignoring however that it could have already been called in `next_back` with those indexes.

[rust/library/core/src/iter/adapters/zip.rs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/0148b971c921a0831fbf3357e5936eec724e3566/library/core/src/iter/adapters/zip.rs#L200-L208)

|  | self.index += 1; |
|  | // match the base implementation's potential side effects |

|  | unsafe { |

[Playground link](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&mode=release&edition=2018&gist=196385a61f316746f71e9a59aa68d6e7) that demonstrates how this can be exploited to get two mutable references to the same data and cause an use-after-free bug.
