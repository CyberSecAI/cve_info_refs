- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in Adobe Illustrator 2021.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), with a low attack complexity (AC:L). User interaction (UI:R) is required. The attack does not require any privileges (PR:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to convince a user to open a specially crafted file in Adobe Illustrator to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker would need local access to the system.
