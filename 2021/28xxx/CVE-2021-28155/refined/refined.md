Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-28155:

**Verification:**

The provided document explicitly mentions CVE-2021-28155 in Table 2, associating it with the "Feature Response Flooding" vulnerability (V4) affecting multiple devices including the JBL TUNE500BT. Therefore the content relates to the specified CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is the lack of proper handling of continuous, unsolicited LMP responses (specifically LMP_features_res packets). The affected devices don't limit or properly process these responses, leading to a denial of service.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The devices fail to validate or limit the rate of incoming LMP feature response packets.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** The continuous stream of unsolicited responses overwhelms the device's processing capabilities.
    *   **Firmware Flaw:**  The underlying firmware of the Bluetooth chipsets lacks proper mechanisms to handle this type of flooding attack.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
   *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a DoS. This can manifest as:
        *   **Firmware Crash:** In some devices, this leads to a crash of the Bluetooth firmware.
        *   **Device Shutdown:** In other cases, the device completely shuts down.
        *   **Disrupted Functionality:** If the devices accept multiple connections, the attack can disrupt active BT connections, for example stopping audio playback. The user will need to manually restart the device or re-connect.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Over-the-Air (OTA):** The attack is performed over the air using Bluetooth communication.
    *   **LMP Packet Flooding:** The attacker floods the target device with unsolicited LMP feature response packets.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within radio range of the target device.
    *   **Bluetooth Device:** The attacker needs a device capable of sending custom LMP packets (e.g., a modified ESP32 development kit).
    *   **Target BDAddress:** The attacker needs to know the Bluetooth Device Address (BDAddress) of the target.
    *   **No Pairing Required:** The attack can be launched without prior pairing or authentication.

**Additional Notes (from the document):**
*   The document mentions that this vulnerability affects multiple vendors and chipsets, including Espressif (ESP32), JBL (TUNE500BT), and Xiaomi (MDZ-36-DB).
*   The vulnerability arises from failures when sending oversized LMP packets, starting procedures out-of-order, or by flooding LMP packets.
*   The provided text suggests a lack of flexible tools for over-the-air testing, which may contribute to the presence of such vulnerabilities.
*   The document mentions that the Core Specification only allows for limited "LMP test mode", which may have resulted in the lack of testing for uncommon scenarios.

This vulnerability, while not allowing for arbitrary code execution, poses a significant risk because of the large number of affected devices and the relative ease of exploitation.
