{
  "CVE-2021-28706": {
    "root_cause": "A calculation done with 32-bit precision, which may overflow when a guest is permitted to have close to 16TiB of memory, which may result in the guest increasing its memory allocation beyond the administrator established limit.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A guest may be able to allocate unbounded amounts of memory to itself, potentially causing a Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host.",
    "attack_vectors": "A guest can issue hypercalls to increase its memory allocation.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a guest VM on a vulnerable Xen hypervisor and have the ability to make hypercalls."
