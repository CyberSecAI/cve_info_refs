- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to a memory leak.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attack vector (AV:L), low attack complexity (AC:L), no privileges required (PR:N), user interaction required (UI:R), no scope change (S:U).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to get a user to open a malicious file.
