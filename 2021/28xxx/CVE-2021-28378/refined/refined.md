          "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing string escaping on the client-side for content fetched from the server. Specifically, the `label.name`, `issue.title`, and `body` fields were not properly escaped before being rendered in HTML, which allows injection of arbitrary code.",

          "attack_vectors": "The primary attack vector is through the issue and pull request comment system. An attacker can inject malicious code through:\n\n*   Creating a label with malicious code in its name.\n*   Adding an issue with malicious code in its title and/or body.\n*   Posting a comment with a link referencing the injected issue, exploiting the dynamic link processing.",

This RCE is possible with the git hook feature if `DISABLE_GIT_HOOKS` is set to `false`."

This could allow them to execute arbitrary code in the browser of any user who views the affected content, potentially leading to:\n  *   Session hijacking\n  *   Data theft\n  *   Redirecting users to malicious sites\n  *   Other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.",

The attacker can create issues or comments with malicious payloads on any public or accessible repository. The attacker can also induce a targeted attack where they create a malicious label, or they can create a malicious issue or comment, with the intention of impacting another user who may see a preview of the comment when they hover their cursor over an issue link."
