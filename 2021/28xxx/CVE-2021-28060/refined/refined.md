The provided content is related to CVE-2021-28060.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input sanitization in the "set image from url" functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). It allows an attacker to make GET requests to arbitrary URLs by controlling the input to the "set image from url" feature.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote attacker can forge GET requests to internal resources, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or abusing other internal services.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the "set image from url" feature, where a malicious actor can inject a crafted URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to interact with the "set image from url" feature, and therefore would require authenticated access, though it is not stated explicitly that the vulnerability is only exploitable when authenticated.
