### PunBB 1.3.4

**PunBB 1.3.4** has been released. The main change since 1.3.3 is the fix of the possible XSS vulnerability in profile.php on password and e-mail change (reported by Richard Sammet). As usual, the hotfix for older versions is released as well, which resolves the same security issue.

### PunBB 1.3.3

**PunBB 1.3.3** is released. 1.3.2 to 1.3.3 changes:

* a lot of bugs fixed (CSS & markup, defects in language files, correct response header placement upon errors, hook rearrangements, parsing posts in feeds, correct language pack detection during the final stage of the install process);
* contains fixes of security flaws (which were fixed by hotfixes in previous versions);
* it is now possible to limit searches to topic subjects or message bodies;
* users are not allowed to change their e-mails without entering their passwords first.

The already existing styles and language packs should be checked for compatibility with the version 1.3.3 before the latter is installed. After checking, the version 1.3.3 may be installed.

### PunBB.Net beta has been released!

We've been working on this project for quite a long time, trying to do our best to create a completely new product, but one that users are already
familiar with. Now we are glad to present new PunBB.Net beta!

PunBB.NET is a forum written using the ASP.NET technology.

This forum is simple, fast and lightweight. The forum's core itself is only a basis, which allows attaching various extensions to it. This makes it
possible for you to have a discussion board, which can be fine-tuned to meet all your requirements prefectly.

PunBB.NET is inspired by PunBB, being its child project. Both these forums utilize similar layouts and functionality, and they both are released under the GPL license.

The main difference between PunBB.NET and PunBB lies in the technology of their implementation.

PunBB.NET beta is the first public version of PunBB.NET.

For more details visit [PunBB.NET page](https://punbb.informer.com/wiki/punbb.net/start).
