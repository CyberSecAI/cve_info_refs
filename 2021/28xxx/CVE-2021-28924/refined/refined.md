Based on the provided information:

**CVE-2021-28924**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a self Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. This occurs due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input before it's rendered on the page. Specifically, the vulnerability is located on the `/nagiosna/groups/queries/1` endpoint.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The application allows embedding of arbitrary HTML and Javascript code due to lack of input sanitization.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker could trick a user into copying and pasting malicious javascript into their browser, which would then execute within the context of the user's session. This could lead to account hijacking.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Self-XSS:** The attacker relies on social engineering to trick the victim into pasting the malicious payload into their own browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to convince a user of the application to copy and paste a crafted payload into their browser.

**CVE-2021-28925**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**:  A SQL injection vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper input sanitization of a parameter. Specifically, the vulnerability is located on the `api/sources/read` endpoint with the vulnerable parameter being  `o[col]`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it fails to properly sanitize user input used in a SQL query.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   A successful SQL injection attack could lead to reading sensitive database data, modifying database data, executing administrative database operations, and potentially issuing OS commands.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   By injecting malicious SQL code into the `o[col]` parameter of the `/api/sources/read` endpoint.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker must be authenticated to be able to exploit the vulnerability.
