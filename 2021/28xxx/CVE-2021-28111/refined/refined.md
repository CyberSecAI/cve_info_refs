Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-28111

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The Dräger X-Dock firmware contains hard-coded default credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Use of Hard-Coded Credentials (CWE-798):** The primary vulnerability is the presence of hard-coded credentials within the firmware.
*  **Active Debug Code (CWE-489):**  This vulnerability is paired with CVE-2021-28112 which is described as an active debug port that also uses the hard-coded credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can gain root access to the underlying operating system.
*   Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on affected installations.
*   The combined exploitation of CVE-2021-28111 and CVE-2021-28112 allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is remote and over a network connection.
*   Exploitation doesn't require authentication.
*   Attackers can leverage the hard-coded credentials via the debug port.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the affected device.
*   The attacker needs to extract and use the hard-coded credentials to gain root access and then execute arbitrary code.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
*   Dräger has released a patch (firmware version 03.00.13 and later) to mitigate the vulnerability.
*   A combined CVSS score was calculated due to the exploitation of the two CVE's together.
