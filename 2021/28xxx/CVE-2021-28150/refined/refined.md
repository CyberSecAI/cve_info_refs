Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described, including those relevant to CVE-2021-28150:

**CVE-2021-28150 is related to Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')**

* **Root Cause:** The `/tools.cgi` handler, responsible for network diagnostics (ping), fails to properly filter user-provided data in the "destination" parameter. This lack of input validation allows for the injection of arbitrary OS commands.
* **Vulnerability:** OS Command Injection. The application does not sanitize user input, allowing the injection of shell metacharacters.
* **Impact:** A remote attacker with minimal privileges can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with root privileges.
* **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted request to the `/tools.cgi` handler, including shell metacharacters within the "destination" parameter.
* **Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs network access to the device.
    *   The attacker requires minimal privileges (e.g., guest account).

**Other Vulnerabilities Described (Not Related to CVE-2021-28150 but in the same advisory):**

*   **Hidden Functionality (Backdoor):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The device has an undocumented telnet service running on port 5188 with hardcoded credentials (`root:superzxmn`).
    *   **Vulnerability:** Backdoor account with hardcoded credentials.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can gain unauthorized root access to the device.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Connecting to the telnet service on port 5188 using the hardcoded credentials.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs network access to the device.

*   **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `/log_download.cgi` handler does not validate user input and allows path traversal.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Path Traversal. Allows access to arbitrary files on the system.
    *   **Impact:** A remote attacker can download any file from the device.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting a URL to `/log_download.cgi` with ".." sequences to access files outside the intended directory (e.g., `http://[ip]/log_download.cgi?type=../../etc/passwd`).
    *  **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs network access to the device and a valid login.

*   **Insecure direct object references to static files:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The device allows direct access to a sensitive configuration file `cli.conf` via `/backup2.cgi` without authentication.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Insecure Direct Object Reference.
    *   **Impact:** Sensitive information such as the administrator password can be revealed.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to the file via `http://[ip]/backup2.cgi`.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs network access to the device.

**Additional Details:**

*   The affected version is Hongdian H8922 version 3.0.5.
*   The vendor was unresponsive to vulnerability reports.
*   The advisory provides a proof-of-concept of command injection using `*;ps*` in the ping destination field and a path traversal example to download `/etc/passwd`.
