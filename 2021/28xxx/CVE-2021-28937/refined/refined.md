Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28937:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is the inclusion of the web management interface password in plaintext within the HTML source code of the `/password.html` page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Plaintext Storage:** The device stores the web management interface password in plaintext, without any hashing or encryption.
*   **Plaintext Exposure:** The password, in its plaintext form, is included directly in the HTML response of the `/password.html` page.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The page doesn't sanitize or mask the password before embedding it in the HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Password Disclosure:** Attackers can easily obtain the device's web management interface password by simply viewing the source code of the `/password.html` page.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Once the password is obtained, an attacker can gain full control over the device's web management interface, including changing configurations and performing malicious activities.
*   **Further Exploitation:** Compromised devices can be used as entry points for attacks on the local network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device to access the `/password.html` page.
*   **Web Browser:** The attacker can use any web browser to send a GET request to the affected page and view the HTML source.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be connected to the same network as the vulnerable WiFi repeater.
*   **Basic Web Navigation Skills:** The attacker needs only the ability to use a web browser and view HTML source code.
*   **No prior authentication required:** The attacker does not need to login or authenticate to view the password in the HTML source.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the Acexy Wireless-N WiFi Repeater REV 1.0 with firmware 28.08.06.1.
*   The device uses HTTP instead of HTTPS which makes the vulnerability easier to exploit since traffic can be easily intercepted.
*   The fact that the password is stored in plaintext indicates poor security practices on the part of the manufacturer.
