Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-28490:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The core issue lies in how OWASP CSRFGuard versions 3.0, 3.1.0, and pre-release versions of 4.0 handle CSRF tokens. Specifically, the CSRF cookie can be retrieved using only a session token. This allows an attacker to bypass CSRF protection mechanisms if the browser does not enforce Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies or if the web application is configured to allow cross-origin requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Robust CSRF Protection:**  The vulnerability stems from an inadequate implementation of the synchronizer token pattern. The reliance on just a session token for retrieving the CSRF token makes it possible for attackers to obtain the token through cross-origin requests.
- **Insufficient CORS Enforcement:** The vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that the application might not have proper CORS policies in place. If the browser doesn't deny cross-origin requests, or if the application is configured to allow them, the attack is successful.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery:** An attacker can potentially craft malicious requests to perform actions on behalf of a user, leading to unauthorized state changes in the web application. This might include modifying user profiles, making purchases, or other sensitive actions.
- **Complete Compromise:** The impact is rated as high across Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability in the provided description, but this is dependent on the application. In most situations, an attacker is limited to the actions that can be made by an authenticated user.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can potentially manipulate user data, which may include modifying account details, or other actions that the user can normally perform.
- **Availability Issues:** In theory, it's possible to cause application disruptions by executing unwanted or damaging actions. However, this isn't explicitely mentioned in the description.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Links or Forms:** An attacker can send malicious links or trick a user into submitting a malicious form from a domain they control.
- **Third-party Request:** The attacker crafts a request from their malicious domain that retrieves the CSRF token.
- **Browser Execution:**  An attacker can trick an end user into downloading and opening a .html file in the same browser that they are currently logged-in to the current web application with.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Host a Malicious Website:** The attacker must control a domain or host content from which they can send cross-origin requests.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers often need to trick users into clicking links or submitting forms, as the exploit typically relies on an authenticated user's browser and session.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attack does not require the attacker to have valid credentials on the target web application.
- **Target Must Not Enforce CORS** The exploit requires the target web application to allow cross-origin requests.

**Additional Notes**
- The content mentions that modern browsers with proper pre-flight checking may block this attack, but not all web applications support the required configurations.
- The vulnerability relies on how browsers handle cross-origin requests and how applications are configured.
- The content notes that while a high CVSS score is assigned, the exploitability in real-world scenarios might be limited due to browser security features. The vulnerability requires that the browser make cross-origin requests from a malicious domain (or, an attacker tricks an end user into downloading and opening a .html file in the same browser that they are currently logged-in to the current web application with).

In summary, CVE-2021-28490 describes a vulnerability in older versions of OWASP CSRFGuard that can allow CSRF attacks if browsers or web applications do not properly enforce CORS policies, which makes it possible for an attacker to retrieve a CSRF token from a malicious domain.
