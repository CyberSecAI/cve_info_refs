Root cause of vulnerability:
Malicious PV backends can cause a denial of service to guests by sending high-frequency events.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
The vulnerability exists due to unhardened frontends in guests that don't properly handle high-frequency events from PV backends. Specifically, the blkfront, netfront, and hvc_xen (console) backends are affected.

Impact of exploitation:
A malicious PV backend can cause a denial of service in the guest by overwhelming it with interrupts, leading to the guest being unable to function correctly.

Attack vectors:
A malicious PV backend running in a driver domain can send high-frequency events to guests being serviced by that backend.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to control a PV backend in a driver domain that is servicing the targeted guest.
