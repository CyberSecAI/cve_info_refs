Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28950:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of invalid file attributes returned by a FUSE server. Specifically, a private implementation `fuse_make_bad()` in `fuse_iget()` failed to remove the bad inode from the inode cache, causing a retry loop with `iget5_locked()` to repeatedly find the same bad inode, leading to a stall.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of error conditions: The FUSE implementation did not correctly handle cases where the FUSE server returns invalid attributes for a file.
- Inadequate inode cache management: The private implementation, `fuse_make_bad()`, lacked the necessary logic to remove the bad inode from the inode cache.
- Retry loop without proper exit: The retry loop using `iget5_locked()` continued indefinitely without checking for the possibility of encountering a persistently bad inode, leading to a live lock.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: A local user with the ability to run a FUSE server could exploit this to cause a system-wide stall, effectively leading to a denial of service. The system becomes unresponsive because a CPU gets stuck in an infinite loop.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local exploitation: The vulnerability is exploitable by a local user who can run a FUSE server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to run a FUSE server on the target system. This implies some level of access to the system.
- No special privileges are explicitly required beyond the ability to run a FUSE server.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content from `git.kernel.org` contains the fix for this vulnerability, showing the addition of `remove_inode_hash(inode);` to `fuse_make_bad()`, indicating that the core issue was the inode not being removed from the hash, leading to an infinite loop.
- The description indicates that the original fix for CVE-2020-36322 introduced a similar denial-of-service issue (infinite loop in kernel space), which is fixed by the patch associated with CVE-2021-28950.
- The vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions prior to the fix (around 5.10 and 5.11 based on the content), with patches backported to older LTS kernels.
