    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The Bluetooth Classic implementation in Espressif ESP-IDF 4.4 and earlier does not properly handle the reception of multiple LMP_IO_Capability_req packets during the pairing process.",

        "Improper handling of duplicated LMP packets",
        "Memory corruption due to replayed packets"
