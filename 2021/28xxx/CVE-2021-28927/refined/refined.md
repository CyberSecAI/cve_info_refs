{
  "CVE-2021-28927": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The text-to-speech engine in libretro RetroArch for Windows 1.9.0 - 1.9.4 passes unsanitized input to PowerShell, allowing attackers to execute code via command injection.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The `accessibility_speak_windows` function in `platform_win32.c` does not sanitize input before passing it to PowerShell for text-to-speech, leading to command injection.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Command Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution under the context of the RetroArch user. This could lead to full remote code execution if files are loaded from network shares. User systems can be compromised just by browsing through menu items that the text-to-speech engine would read out if enabled.",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "By creating a directory or file with a malicious name. When the user navigates to this entry in the menu, the text-to-speech engine reads it, injecting the malicious code.",
          "Through the use of network file shares containing malicious file names.",
          "Through the use of malicious zip files"
       ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs write access to file systems that RetroArch reads or access to network locations containing malicious content. They do not need elevated privileges to execute the attack. They must also understand how to correctly craft the malicious command in powershell."
