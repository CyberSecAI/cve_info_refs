- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The XML parser used by PowerArchiver to preview XML files processes external entities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: XXE vulnerability. The application processes external entities without proper sanitization or restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to local resources on the user's machine. This is demonstrated by reading the content of `win.ini` and exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled server.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is triggered by previewing a specially crafted XML file within the PowerArchiver application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious XML file. The user must then select this file for preview in PowerArchiver. No other specific capabilities are described beyond basic user interaction.
