Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-28964:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by a race condition in the Btrfs driver during the process of rewinding the tree modification log when cloning an extent buffer of an old root. This occurs when resolving backreferences as part of a logical ino ioctl call or fiemap. The race happens because the extent buffer is cloned without acquiring a read lock, potentially leading to inconsistent data being used by different tasks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Race Condition:** Concurrent access to the extent buffer during cloning, without proper locking, can lead to data corruption.
- **Missing Lock:** The code fails to acquire a read lock on the extent buffer before cloning it in the `get_old_root` function.
- **Incorrect nritems value:** A cloned copy of an extent buffer is used with the nritems value set to 0 in it's header while it can be changed by another task.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Crash:** The race condition leads to an assertion failure (BUG_ON) in the `__tree_mod_log_rewind` function, resulting in a kernel crash. This causes a denial of service (DoS).
- **Potential Data Corruption:** The lack of proper locking during cloning may lead to data corruption, although the provided content focuses on the crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** A local user can trigger the vulnerability by initiating actions that involve resolving backreferences such as fiemap or the logical ino ioctl calls on a btrfs filesystem.
- **Concurrent Operations:** The vulnerability is triggered by specific timing conditions, requiring another task to concurrently modify the same extent buffer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **Btrfs Filesystem:** The system must be using a Btrfs filesystem.
- **Triggering Operations:** The attacker needs to be able to perform actions that trigger the affected code path (i.e. resolving backreferences).

**Technical Details:**
The detailed steps leading to the vulnerability are described in the commit message of the fix provided in the first document.
In short, here is a more concise version:
1. A task is resolving backreferences using fiemap or logical ino ioctl call, and we have `fs_info->tree_mod_seq == 1`.
2.  Another task is at `ctree.c:balance_level()` which changes the root, and calls `tree_mod_log_insert_root()` to register the changes.
3. `tree_mod_log_insert_root()` creates log elements to keep the old root.
4. The old root is freed.
5. A third task T allocates the same metadata extent as the old root, and starts modifying it.
6. The first task then calls `btrfs_search_old_slot()` to get an old root to resolve backreferences.
7. The first task calls `get_old_root()` which does not take a lock on the old root, and clones it.
8. The first task calls `__tree_mod_log_rewind()` using the cloned old root, and receives an invalid state, causing a `BUG_ON()` and triggering a kernel crash.

**Fix:**
The fix involves acquiring a read lock on the extent buffer before cloning it in `ctree.c:get_old_root()`. This prevents concurrent modifications during the cloning process, ensuring data consistency.
