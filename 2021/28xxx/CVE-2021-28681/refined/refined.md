{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2021-28681",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Pion WebRTC library incorrectly allowed data channel communication even when DTLS certificate verification failed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The library did not properly terminate the connection upon DTLS fingerprint verification failure, leaving the DTLSTransport active."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could establish a data channel despite presenting an invalid DTLS certificate, potentially leading to unauthorized data exchange or other attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited during the PeerConnection handshake by manipulating the DTLS fingerprint in the SDP offer or answer.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the ICE password to perform the attack. The attack takes place during the PeerConnection handshake."
  },
  "affected_versions": "< v3.0.15",
  "patched_versions": "v3.0.15",
  "workarounds": "Users should monitor `PeerConnectionState` and not use the `PeerConnection` after the state changes to `PeerConnectionStateFailed`.",
  "additional_info": "The issue was discovered by Gaukas, and was fixed by closing the DTLSTransport when fingerprint verification fails. The fix is in commit [545613d](https://github.com/pion/webrtc/commit/545613dcdeb5dedb01cce94175f40bcbe045df2e).",
   "vulnerability_severity": "Moderate"
