# Failed DTLS certificate verification doesn't stop data channel communication

Moderate

[Sean-Der](/Sean-Der)
published
GHSA-74xm-qj29-cq8p
Mar 18, 2021

## Package

Pion WebRTC

## Affected versions

< v3.0.15

## Patched versions

v3.0.15

## Description

### Impact

Data channel communication was incorrectly allowed with users who have failed DTLS certificate verification.

This attack requires

* Attacker knows the ICE password.
* Only take place during PeerConnection handshake.

This attack can be detected by monitoring `PeerConnectionState` in all versions of Pion WebRTC.

### Patches

Users should upgrade to v3.0.15.

The exact patch is [545613d](https://github.com/pion/webrtc/commit/545613dcdeb5dedb01cce94175f40bcbe045df2e)

### Workarounds

Users should listen for when `PeerConnectionState` changes to `PeerConnectionStateFailed`. When it enters this state users should not continue using the PeerConnection.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in <https://github.com/pion/webrtc>
* Email us at team@pion.ly

Thank you to <https://github.com/Gaukas> for discovering this.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-28681

### Weaknesses

| Your environment.  * Version: pion/webrtc v3.0.14 * Browser: N/A * Other Information - reproducable with example/data-channels-create & example/data-channels  What did you do?  * Run both `data-channels-create` and `data-channels` from example. * Once the SDP offer has been generated, decode it with base64. * Randomly edit the DTLS fingerprint value in the SDP offer * Copy & paste the base64-encoded SDP offer into the waiting `data-channels` * Copy & paste the SDP answer generated by `data-channels` into `data-channels-create`  What did you expect? The built-in fingerprints verification should throw an error and therefore prevent the data-channel from being established. What happened? The data channel was created as usual.  ``` ICE Connection State has changed: checking ICE Connection State has changed: connected Data channel 'data'-'824635660400' open. Random messages will now be sent to any connected DataChannels every 5 seconds Sending 'SBfBWYaFzaFZDiV' Message from DataChannel 'data': 'EtaKTfGglNgpNNn'  ``` |

| Hey [@gaukas](https://github.com/gaukas)  We do have a test for this `TestInvalidFingerprintCausesFailed` that is properly catching this. I will confirm this works and update as appropriate thanks for filing this! |

| Ah I see. So the issue is that we set PeerConnectionState to failed, but we don't actually tear down the connections.  I will fix that and tag a new release. This probably even warrants a CVE! If you are interested, good for resume and helps people update quicker. |

Just for your reference, attached is the log from both instances, in which `2 bytes` from the fingerprint in the offer (generated by `data-channels-create`) have been altered.  ``` $ ./data-channels-create 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  ICE Connection State has changed: checking ICE Connection State has changed: connected Data channel 'data'-'824635376524' open.

| Yea you were 100% right [@gaukas](https://github.com/gaukas) before! The test we had wasn't very useful.  I fixed the issue and added a test mind trying [#1709](https://github.com/pion/webrtc/pull/1709) ? |
