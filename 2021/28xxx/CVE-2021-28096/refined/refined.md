Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the proxy's susceptibility to having its connection table saturated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The proxy connection table can be saturated by an attacker.
- The proxy lacks sufficient mechanisms to prevent the connection table saturation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful attack leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition, where the proxy denies new connections.
- Users of the proxy will experience service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the adjacent network.
- An attacker within the same network segment as the vulnerable device can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be on the same adjacent network as the vulnerable proxy.
- No specific privileges or user interaction are required to execute the attack.
- The attack complexity is low.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Stormshield Network Security (SNS) and Netasq products.
- The provided CVSS metrics indicate that the confidentiality and integrity impacts are none, while the availability impact is low. The CVSS score is 4.3 base and 3.5 temporal.
- A workaround is to either not use the proxy or to apply Quality of Service (QoS) rules to limit the traffic going through the proxy.
- The vulnerability is fixed in specific versions of SNS, but there is no solution for Netasq.
- Rebooting the proxy with `nrestart tproxyd` can temporarily restore service.
