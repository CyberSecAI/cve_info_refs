- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The captive portal, when using an external LDAP service for authentication, does not properly handle login attempts, allowing for user/password enumeration through brute-force attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - LDAP user/password enumeration vulnerability in the captive portal.
    - Insufficient protection against brute-force attacks on the captive portal.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can list valid usernames and passwords from the external LDAP server.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable through brute-force attacks on the authentication captive portal.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be on the adjacent network.
    - No privileges are required for the attack.
    - No user interaction is required.
