Configures the authentication route to provide users with a JWT token upon login. Additionally, configures express.js to authenticate the JWT token when accessing any routes of the form `http://<deployment ip>:3000/api/db/*` to ensure that only authenticated users can interact with the subscriber database.

Please note that when deploying with this in place users should create the environment variable JWT\_SECRET\_KEY to override the default value or the JWT tokens can be spoofed.

I believe that this PR addresses [#837](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/837)

| ok, having tried this myself and checking out the docs I think this is expected behavior. If you compare [v6](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-lock-json) to [v7](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-lock-json) you'll see that v6 versions of the package-lock.json schema don't have the packages attribute. Since `npm install` rebuilds the entire `node_modules` tree it has to also rewrite the lock file. The intention of the lock file is to allow reconstruction of the `node_modules` tree as it was built so it makes sense that building under different versions would change the schema to match. Given that the application appears to work in both versions and that it is the lock file that is changing and not `package.json` itself I don't think this should be a cause for concern. |

| As someone coming from a cpp/rust background and doing a bit of nodejs, prorgramming, I've been very confused by `npm install` vs `npm update`. In the philosophy of npm, `npm install` is *not* intended to do a clean install, and will do the updates to inplace lock files you've noticed. It will also actually update the versions of dependencies according to the package file constraints ignoring the versions pinned in the lock file if they are not already installed! It was apparently intended as an interactive command to be mostly used by human developers. The command `npm ci` was later added to do a true "clean install," and is really what you want to be using in cases like this. Here are the docs for npm ci: <https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-ci> |

| I would say that I largely agree with that. In docker files for my other projects I typically prefer `npm ci --no-optional`. The `ci` installation path is intended for CI/CD pipelines so I think it makes more sense for containerized applications. I'm old enough with npm that i reflexively `rm -rf node_modules` before any kind of install. I think for the purposes of the kind of testing we have been doing for this PR both options are equivalent, but it may be worth revisiting [this](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/blob/main/docker/webui/Dockerfile#L16) in a different context. If nothing else, I find it usually speeds up the build process. |

| I think for the purposes of the kind of testing we have been doing for this PR both options are equivalent  That's what I am trying to clarify-- they are not, although you might reasonably expect them to be coming from other build tools! `npm install`, unlike other build tools, does *not* treat the package.lock file as sacred, and will update it as needed to reflect the current state of node\_modules. You see the inverse change to the version controlled package.lock file on the main branch if you do a clean clone and `npm install` the webui with npm 7. |

| Hi [@rashley-iqt](https://github.com/rashley-iqt) and [@matt9j](https://github.com/matt9j)  I first knew `npm ci --no-optional` today. It seems that all of the open5gs documentation should be replaced with this command when installing npm modules. Also, we need to update the [install script](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/blob/main/docs/assets/webui/install).  I don't think it's a good idea to merge right now since all users need logout and log back in.  I plan to release v2.2.1 within 2-3 weeks. At that time, I will apply this pull request and notify users that a new login is required in WebUI.  You can change the necessary work in your api-tokens branch if you want to. I'll do the rest in package release v2.2.1.  Thank you so much for your effort. Sukchan |

| [@rashley-iqt](https://github.com/rashley-iqt)  I've merged your pull request today.  Your last commit is not working in my environment. Since login session is not maintained, the user has to log in every time. So, I removed it.  You can see my follow-up on [569f98f](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/commit/569f98f92cedc8ea19f94bf86d7b175737cc197f).  Please feel free to let me know if I have done anything wrong.  I'd really appreciate you for this work. Sukchan |

   ```
   If both Delete-Session-Request/Response and
   UEContextReleaseCommand/UEContextReleaseComplete are failed at the same time,
   UE cannot attach to the EPC infinitely.

   So, I've add the protection code
   if timer expires when MME does not receive Delete-Session-Response.

### **[rashley-iqt](/rashley-iqt)** commented [Mar 10, 2021](#issue-827727045)

| An unauthenticated user can utilize information provided by the login page of the webui component to craft HTTP requests that will allow that user to create, read, update, and delete entries in the subscriber database. This includes the ability to add administrative users, add/modify/delete subscribers, and add/modify/delete profiles.  Properly crafted HTTP GET and DELETE requests with empty bodies will cause data to be returned or deleted on the following routes: http://:3000/api/db/account http://:3000/api/db/profile http://:3000/api/db/subscriber http://:3000/api/db/account/ http://:3000/api/db/profile/<profile\_id> http://:3000/api/db/subscriber/<imsi\_number>  Properly crafted HTTP POST,PUT and PATCH requests with properly crafted bodies will cause data to be inserted or updated on the following routes: http://:3000/api/db/account http://:3000/api/db/profile http://:3000/api/db/subscriber http://:3000/api/db/account/ http://:3000/api/db/profile/<profile\_id> http://:3000/api/db/subscriber/<imsi\_number>  This is caused by the configuration of express js in [index.js](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/blob/main/webui/server/routes/index.js). This should be updated to correctly validate the user making the API calls. |
