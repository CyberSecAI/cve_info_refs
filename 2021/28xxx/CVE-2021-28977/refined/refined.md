The provided content is related to CVE-2021-28977.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The file content filtering in `admin/upload.php` is not comprehensive.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtering of uploaded files. By adding comments or other file header information to malicious files (such as xla, pages, gzip) containing HTML, attackers can bypass upload restrictions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into uploaded files, which can then be executed when a user accesses the file, potentially leading to the compromise of user information.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through uploading a specially crafted file to the server using the vulnerable `admin/upload.php` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to upload files to the server.
