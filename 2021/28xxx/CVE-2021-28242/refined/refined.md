Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of the `cf_name` parameter in the `evoadm.php` component of b2evolution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `cf_name` parameter is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   Specifically, the vulnerability is described as both boolean-based blind and error-based SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can obtain sensitive database information.
*   The vulnerability can lead to full database compromise, potentially including data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, and in some cases command execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
*   The specific attack vector is via crafting malicious requests to the `evoadm.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with "moderator" level privileges, which allows them to access the "Collections" tab and create new filters. This is also described as a "low" privilege requirement.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attack requires no user interaction beyond the attacker sending the crafted malicious request.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable parameter is `cf_name` in the `evoadm.php` script.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by creating a new filter under the "Collections" tab.
*   The vulnerability can be verified by injecting a single quote (') character into the `cf_name` parameter, resulting in SQL errors.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable using tools like `sqlmap`, confirming its ability to extract data and potentially execute commands.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered on b2evolution version 7.2.2-stable.
*   The fix was implemented in version 7.2.3-stable.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 score of 8.8, categorized as high severity.
*   The attack complexity is low and no user interaction is required, making it relatively easy to exploit with the required privileges.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned both CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command) and CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command).
