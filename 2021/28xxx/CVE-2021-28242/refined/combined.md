# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

**Product:** b2evolution 7.2.2-stable

**Vulnerability Title:** Authenticated Blind & Error SQL injection

**Identifier:** Owasp Top 10: Injection

**Detailed description:** It was found that when we create a new filter under the Collections tab as a moderator user privilege, evoadm.php is given a get request with cf\_name and with all other parameters where name is the cf\_name and it is vulnerable to boolean-based blind & error-based SQL injection.

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Login to [http://server\_ip/b2evolution/evoadm.php](http://192.168.10.60:8080/b2evolution/evoadm.php) as moderator user privilege.

![]()

Admin login page

2. Click on Collections → Custom filters → input single quote (‘) and click on Apply filters

3. The above point will through a bunch of SQL errors which confirms that the cf\_name is vulnerable to SQL injection.

![]()

The SQL error against the parameter cf\_name

4. After confirming that cf\_name is vulnerable to SQL injection feeding the request to SQLMAP and it will do the rest of the work for you.

![]()

The result of SQLMAP against the cf\_name parameter

**Command Execution via sqlmap:**

| [@de-adshot](https://github.com/de-adshot) [@fplanque](https://github.com/fplanque) I hope that a fix for the critical security issue will be released in a way that users will notice. Hope to get information which versions are affected? (6.11.x or 7.2.x)? I would appreciate this. |

| Only users who have access to collections in the backoffice would be able to use this exploit. These are typically trusted users. So the severity of the issue is LOW. |

| [@farfallosa](https://github.com/farfallosa) I have not tested in 6.11.x. The vulnerability was tested and identified on 7.2.2.  [@fplanque](https://github.com/fplanque) this issue can be said trust issue. To be noted there are multiple user privileges can have access to collections as mentioned in the mail. Also there are multiple external attack vectors are available and one of them can be social engineering.  CVSS 3.1 vector : AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H CVSS score :8.8(High)  Considering the above facts the vulnerability will fall under HIGH category. The type of vulnerability which was reported will never fall under LOW category in any circumstances. Hence we shall conclude that this vulnerability falls under HIGH severity. |

| [@fplanque](https://github.com/fplanque) you fixed the security issue in 7.2.3 but is there a fix for 6.11.5 or 6.11.7, too? May be that the issue was closed too soon. I can understand, that you won't publish a fix, because you won't spot to it. But nevertheless - if there exists a security issue and if [@de-adshot](https://github.com/de-adshot) 's analysis is correct (HIGH severity) the users should be informed. A fix dumb for 6.11.5 or 6.11.7 (as last version before 7x) should be offered. That would be awesome. If those versions are not affected, it would be great to know. Thanks |

| We (unpaid core developers) do not support v6 any more. (Anyone who wants to continue using old deprecated versions is welcome to fix them and publish fixes. It's all open source.) |
