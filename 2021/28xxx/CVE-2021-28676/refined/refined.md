Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28676:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `FliDecode.c` file within the Pillow library.
- The `FliDecode` function did not properly validate the "block advance" value read from the FLI file. Specifically, it did not check if the advance was non-zero.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Zero Check:** The core vulnerability is the lack of a check to ensure the block advance value is not zero.
- **Infinite Loop:** If the block advance value is zero, the decoding process would enter an infinite loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can craft a malicious FLI image file where the block advance value is set to zero. When Pillow attempts to process this file, it will get stuck in an infinite loop, leading to a denial of service as the application becomes unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious FLI File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted FLI image file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to provide a FLI file:** The attacker needs to be able to provide an application using the vulnerable Pillow library with a malicious FLI file. This could be through a website, email attachment, or any other method the application uses to accept images. No specific user privileges are needed.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was found by OSS-Fuzz.
* The issue dates back to the PIL fork.
* The fix implemented a check to ensure that `advance` is not zero before processing the FLI data.
* The fix prevents infinite loop during load.
* The vulnerability is present in Pillow versions prior to 8.2.0.
* The vulnerability is classified as High Severity due to the potential for DoS.
* The attack vector is network-based with low complexity and no user interaction required.

This information is more detailed than the official CVE description, as it includes the specific code location (`FliDecode.c`), the exact nature of the missing check, and the specific type of denial of service.
