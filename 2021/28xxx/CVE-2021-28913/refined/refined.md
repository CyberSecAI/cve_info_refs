- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The eibPort V3 device has a hardcoded "eibPort String" that acts as the root SSH key passphrase. This string can be validated through an unauthenticated service at `/webif/SecurityModule`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306): The `/webif/SecurityModule` endpoint does not require authentication, allowing anyone to attempt to validate the hardcoded string.
    - Hardcoded credential: The root SSH key passphrase is hardcoded.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain SSH root access to the eibPort V3 device.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network access: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network via the `/webif/SecurityModule` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the `/webif/SecurityModule` endpoint. No prior authentication is required.
