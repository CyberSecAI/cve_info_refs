### **[Qwaz](/Qwaz)** commented [Feb 19, 2021](#issuecomment-782181703)

| I'm not sure if this fix interacts well with `next_back()`'s length handling. Say we are using iterators with length 1 for both A and B.   1. Initialize zip  * index = 0, len = 1  2. Call `next_back()`  * index = 0, len = 0 * `get_unchecked(0)` is called on both A and B  3. Call `next()`  * Since `self.index < self.a.size()`, `get_unchecked(0)` is called again on A * index = 1, len = 1   Calling `get_unchecked()` on the same index twice is a violation of the second safety invariant of `TrustedRandomAccess` and can lead to duplicated elements. |

| Oh, was this already possible even before the fix?  Yes, it was and this PR wasn't aimed to fix it. I've already opened [#82291](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82291) a couple of hours ago showing how it can be exploited and [#82292](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/82292) to fix it, unfortunately it conflicts with this PR (both add a test at the end of the same file). |

| It's worth considering if the fix that moved the increment of `index` can be reverted.  Alternatively - would it be better to rewrite the whole zip specialization in terms of a "next\_unchecked" method instead, and would that be more robust? |

| It's worth considering if the fix that moved the increment of index can be reverted.  What does that have to do with the bug this PR should fix?  Alternatively - would it be better to rewrite the whole zip specialization in terms of a "next\_unchecked" method instead, and would that be more robust?  A discussion about that started [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82291#issuecomment-782313655), then we moved on zulip ([here](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/219381-t-libs/topic/Improving.20TrustedRandomAccess.20and.20its.20Zip.20specialization/near/227088066)). Anyway I thought [you already ruled out](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/33090#issuecomment-212998513) a `next_unchecked` approach because LLVM had more trouble to optimize it (and I think it still has). |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : rust
Product : Fedora 33
Version : 1.51.0
Release : 3.fc33
URL : <https://www.rust-lang.org>
Summary : The Rust Programming Language
Description :
Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents
segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

This package includes the Rust compiler and documentation generator.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Security fixes for CVE-2020-36323, CVE-2021-28876, CVE-2021-28878,
CVE-2021-28879, and CVE-2021-31162. These are memory safety bugs in the Rust
standard library. Because it is statically linked, affected applications will
need to be rebuilt to benefit from the fixes. The actual security implications
will depend on how these APIs are used in each particular case.

# Rust: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **202210-09**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rust, the worst of which could result in denial of service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/rust** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.63.0-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.63.0-r1** |

| Package | **dev-lang/rust-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.64.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.64.0** |

### Background

A systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rust. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Please review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Rust users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/rust-1.63.0-r1"

```

All Rust binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/rust-bin-1.64.0"

```

In addition, users using Portage 3.0.38 or later should ensure that packages with Rust binaries have no vulnerable code statically linked into their binaries by rebuilding the @rust-rebuild set:

```
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose @rust-rebuild

```

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-d7f74f0250
2021-04-27 01:12:35.356988
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : rust
Product : Fedora 32
Version : 1.51.0
Release : 3.fc32
URL : <https://www.rust-lang.org>
Summary : The Rust Programming Language
Description :
Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents
segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

This package includes the Rust compiler and documentation generator.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Security fixes for CVE-2020-36323, CVE-2021-28876, CVE-2021-28878,
CVE-2021-28879, and CVE-2021-31162. These are memory safety bugs in the Rust
standard library. Because it is statically linked, affected applications will
need to be rebuilt to benefit from the fixes. The actual security implications
will depend on how these APIs are used in each particular case.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`self.index` can be set to a value greater than `self.len` in this branch. This causes integer overflow in `size_hint()` and lead to a buffer overflow.

[Playground Link](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=release&edition=2018&gist=0e6f0c70e6aaaba62610f19fd9186756) that demonstrates segfault with safe Rust code.
