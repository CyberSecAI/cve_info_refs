Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-28093:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a weak hashing algorithm (Adler32) to generate cache keys for converted images within the OX Documents component. This weak hashing mechanism is prone to hash collisions, where different inputs (images) produce the same hash key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authorization (CWE-285):** The system does not properly ensure that the cached content corresponds to the requested resource due to the weak hash function.
- **Hash Collisions:** The Adler32 algorithm is susceptible to both accidental and purposeful hash collisions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Loss:** An attacker could potentially cause the system to serve a cached image of file A when file B is requested. This can reveal sensitive information intended for only one user to another.
- **Integrity Loss:** An attacker could swap image content leading to displaying modified or malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Upload/Access via Web Interface:** An attacker needs to upload two images that produce the same Adler32 hash and then initiate a view of each image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileged Account:** The attacker must have access to the application to upload files and view images.
- **Ability to Generate Hash Collisions:** The attacker must have the ability or resources to craft two image files that produce the same Adler32 hash.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is specific to the `imageconverter` component of OX Documents.
- The advisory also references similar vulnerabilities (using CRC32 instead of Adler32) within the `documentconverter` (CVE-2021-28094) and `office` (CVE-2021-28095) components.
- The vulnerability has been fixed by replacing the weak hashing algorithms with SHA-256.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 5.9 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)
