Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in ASUS GPUTweak II's drivers, AsIO2_64.sys and AsIO2_32.sys:

**1. Incorrect Access Control**

*   **Root Cause:** The drivers allow low-privileged users to directly interact with physical memory and MSR registers. This is due to the drivers mapping physical memory into the virtual address space of the calling process and lacking proper access control checks on these operations.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Lack of proper access control when interacting with physical memory and MSR registers.
    *   Ability for low-privileged users to call driver routines that map physical memory into their virtual address space.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Low-privileged users can achieve NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  A specially crafted PE (Portable Executable) file that makes use of DeviceIoControl to interact with the driver.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  The attacker needs to be a local user with low privileges and the ability to run an executable.

**2. Stack Buffer Overflow**

*   **Root Cause:** The drivers are vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow due to improper handling of input data/parameters.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Stack buffer overflow vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Low-privileged users can achieve a Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Attack Vectors:**  A specially crafted PE file using DeviceIoControl to trigger the buffer overflow.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  The attacker needs to be a local user with low privileges and the ability to run an executable.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Both vulnerabilities are present in `AsIO2_64.sys` and `AsIO2_32.sys`.
*   The vulnerabilities are fixed in ASUS GPUTweak II version 2.3.0.3 and later.
*   The vulnerabilities were discovered by the Ivannikov Institute for System Programming of the RAS.
