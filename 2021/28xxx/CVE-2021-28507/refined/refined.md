Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-28507:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how the service ACL (Access Control List) is handled for OpenConfig gNOI and OpenConfig RESTCONF. Under specific conditions, the configured service ACL can be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **ACL Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the configured service ACLs for gNOI and RESTCONF. This means that requests that should be denied based on the ACL are incorrectly being forwarded to the respective agents.
- **Incorrect Authorization:** The ACL bypass leads to incorrect authorization, where traffic that should be blocked is allowed to reach the internal services.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** By bypassing the service ACL, an attacker can send requests to the gNOI or RESTCONF agent that they would normally be denied.
- **Limited Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability could allow for limited information disclosure, as indicated by the CVSS score's confidentiality impact (C:L).
- **Data Modification:** An attacker could potentially modify device configuration or data by sending malicious requests through the bypassed ACL, indicated by the integrity impact (I:H).
- **No Availability Impact**: The vulnerability does not impact the availability of the device as the attack vector is modifying configuration (A:N).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning the attacker can exploit this remotely.
- **Specifically crafted requests:** Exploitation requires sending specially crafted requests to the gNOI or RESTCONF interfaces.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the device.
- **Privileged access:** The attacker must have high privileges (PR:H) on the network to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability is only exploitable by an authorized user with high privileges by bypassing the ACL.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is present in Arista EOS software with specific versions.
- The vulnerability is related to the OpenConfig gNOI and RESTCONF transport protocols.
- The provided document also describes related vulnerabilities: CVE-2021-28500, CVE-2021-28501, and CVE-2021-28506, which involve authentication issues with OpenConfig and TerminAttr. These vulnerabilities are separate from CVE-2021-28507, but all are addressed in the same security advisory.
- Mitigation includes disabling the affected agents, or employing a hotfix using the provided OpenConfigProxy, and upgrading to patched versions of EOS.
- The document provides details on required configurations for exploitation, affected software versions, and how to mitigate and resolve the issue.
