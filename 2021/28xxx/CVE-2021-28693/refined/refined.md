- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The bootloader loads boot modules in a temporary area, and Xen copies them to domain memory. However, on Arm systems, Xen fails to "scrub" (clear) these modules before handing the page over to the allocator, potentially leaking sensitive data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Failure to scrub temporary memory holding boot modules before handing the memory to the allocator.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Sensitive information from boot modules may be visible to other domains after boot. This can lead to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with access to a different domain may be able to read sensitive information from memory that was previously used to store boot modules. This is a local attack vector within the hypervisor.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a running domain on the vulnerable Xen hypervisor.

Additional notes:
- The vulnerability affects only Arm systems.
- Systems running with "bootscrub=off" are not vulnerable.
- All Xen versions since 4.12 are vulnerable.
- Patches are provided for Xen versions 4.12.x, 4.13.x, 4.14.x and 4.15.x, and the Xen unstable branch.
