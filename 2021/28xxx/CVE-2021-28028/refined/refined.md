- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When inserting rows from an iterator at a specific index, `toodee` would shift existing items, duplicating their ownership. The space for new elements was reserved based on the `len()` returned by the `ExactSizeIterator`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Double free: elements in the array could be freed twice if the iterator panicked during the insertion process.
    - Exposure of uninitialized/freed elements: If the iterator's `len()` didn't match the actual number of elements, uninitialized or previously freed elements could be exposed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory corruption issues, including double frees and access to uninitialized/freed memory, leading to potential crashes, denial of service, or other undefined behavior.
- **Attack vectors**: Inserting rows using the `insert_row` function with an iterator, where the iterator might panic or have a `len()` mismatch.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the iterator used for inserting rows via the `insert_row` function.
