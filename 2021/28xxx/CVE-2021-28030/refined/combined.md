### Description

Affected versions of this crate passed an unininitialized buffer to a
user-provided `Read` instance in `Tape::take_bytes`.

This can result in safe `Read` implementations reading from the uninitialized
buffer leading to undefined behavior.

The flaw was corrected in commit `1f2dc7f37dd` by removing the unsafe block
and zero-initializing the buffer.
