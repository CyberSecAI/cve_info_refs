- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `push_inner` function in affected versions of the `stack_dst` crate increased the internal length of the array before calling `val.clone()`. If `val.clone()` panicked, the stack could drop an already dropped element or drop uninitialized memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Double free: If `val.clone()` panics, the stack might attempt to drop an element that has already been dropped.
    - Use of uninitialized memory: If `val.clone()` panics, the stack might attempt to drop uninitialized memory, as the length was increased before the clone operation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory corruption, potentially leading to crashes or other undefined behavior.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when using the `push_cloned` method of the `stack_dst::StackA` struct with a clone implementation that panics.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No specific attacker capabilities are mentioned, other than the ability to trigger a panic during the clone operation. This could happen unintentionally due to a bug, or it could be an intentional input designed to cause the panic. The vulnerability is present in the library, not in an application, so the attacker could exploit it by crafting a specific scenario within a project that uses the library.
