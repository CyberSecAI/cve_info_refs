Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-28484:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `yubihsm-connector` utility, which acts as a HTTP to USB proxy for interacting with YubiHSM 2 devices, did not properly validate the length of incoming HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Input Validation:** The core vulnerability lies in the absence of proper length validation for HTTP request bodies sent to the `/api/connector` endpoint.
*   **Infinite Loop:** When a request with a body of 0-2 bytes is sent, the connector forwards it to the YubiHSM 2.  Since YubiHSM2 expects at least 3 bytes, it doesn't respond. Due to a locking mechanism waiting for the response, the connector gets stuck in an infinite loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. The `yubihsm-connector` becomes unresponsive, preventing any further operations until it is restarted. This affects all components that rely on the connector, such as `yubihsm-shell`, `yubihsm_pkcs11`, and the YubiHSM Key Storage Provider.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/api/connector` endpoint of the `yubihsm-connector`.
*   **Malformed Request Body:** The malicious request body has to be between 0 and 2 bytes in length

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:**  By default, the `yubihsm-connector` listens on localhost. However, if configured to listen on the network, an attacker with network access to the server where `yubihsm-connector` is running can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the connector's endpoint.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in `yubihsm-connector` version 3.0.1.
*   Yubico assigned the tracking ID YSA-2021-02 to this vulnerability.
*   Yubico rated this issue as high severity with a CVSS base score of 7.5.
*   Mitigation strategies include using mutual TLS authentication and network segmentation.
