- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Uncontrolled Search Path Element
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly control the search path it uses to load resources, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious files into the search path.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors:** By placing a malicious file in a location that the application searches when loading resources, an attacker can cause the application to load and execute the malicious code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to place malicious files in a location that is within the application's search path.
