{
  "CVE-2021-28544": {
    "Root cause": "Subversion servers reveal 'copyfrom' paths that should be hidden according to configured path-based authorization (authz) rules.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect authorization checks when retrieving log messages for copied nodes."
    ],
    "Impact": "Users with access to a copy of a node can see the 'copyfrom' path of the original, revealing the existence and location of the original protected node. Only the path is revealed, not the content.",
    "Attack vectors": "Retrieving log messages via `svn log` command.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to a copy of a node, which was copied from a protected location. They also need to be able to use the `svn log` command to view the commit history."
  }
