Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28593:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* Use After Free (CWE-416)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* The vulnerability is a use-after-free, meaning the software attempts to access memory that has already been freed, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary file system read. This means an attacker might be able to read sensitive information from the user's file system.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable software is running.
* The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), implying that the user must perform some action, such as opening a specially crafted file to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* An attacker would need to be in a position to convince a user to open a malicious file using a vulnerable version of Adobe Illustrator.

**Summary:** This CVE describes a use-after-free vulnerability in Adobe Illustrator that could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files from the victim's system if the user opens a malicious file. The vulnerability is rated as important, not critical.
