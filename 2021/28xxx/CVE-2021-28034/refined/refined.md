- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `push_inner` function in affected versions of `stack_dst` increases the internal array's length before cloning the value. If the `clone()` call panics, the function might attempt to drop an already dropped element or uninitialized memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Double free or use of uninitialized memory due to a panic during the cloning process in `push_cloned`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other undefined behavior.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by using the `push_cloned` function, where a panic occurs during the `clone()` operation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific capabilities are needed to trigger this, any usage of `push_cloned` on a type that can panic in clone is sufficient. The attacker needs to be able to cause a panic in `clone()`.
