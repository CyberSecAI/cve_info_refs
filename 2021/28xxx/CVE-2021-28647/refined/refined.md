- **Root cause of vulnerability:** DLL hijacking vulnerability in Trend Micro Password Manager version 5 (Consumer).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is susceptible to DLL hijacking, where a malicious DLL file can be injected during the installation process.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by injecting a malicious DLL, potentially leading to complete system compromise each time a user installs a program.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, exploiting the installation process of the Trend Micro Password Manager.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs local access to the system to inject a malicious DLL during the installation of Trend Micro Password Manager. The user would need to run the installer after the malicious dll is placed.
