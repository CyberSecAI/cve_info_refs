The provided content includes extensive changelogs for MobaXterm, a terminal application. While it does contain a large amount of information regarding bug fixes, improvements and new features, there is only one entry that mentions a CVE.

Specifically, version 21.0 mentions:
`* **Improvement**: the application title is now set after a few milliseconds in order to prevent MobaXterm from being flooded with tab title change requests (fixes CVE-2021-28847)`

Based on this information:

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application was setting the tab title immediately upon receiving a request. This could lead to a flood of requests and possibly resource exhaustion or other unintended behavior.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of proper rate limiting or handling of title change requests could lead to resource exhaustion or denial-of-service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially cause performance issues or make MobaXterm unresponsive by sending a flood of tab title change requests.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor could attempt to trigger this issue by rapidly changing tab titles, likely through automated means.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to interact with the application and trigger rapid tab title changes. This could potentially be done remotely if a vulnerable feature exists, or locally through user interaction (e.g. a malicious script or plugin that rapidly changes titles).

The changelog provides more detail than the CVE description which is only a placeholder.
