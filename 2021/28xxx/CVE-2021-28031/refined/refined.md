- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `move_elements` function in affected versions of the `scratchpad` crate used `ptr::read` to read elements while calling a user-provided function `f` on them. This duplicated ownership of the elements. If the user-provided function `f` panicked, the duplicated ownership would lead to a double-free when unwinding.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Double-free vulnerability due to duplicated ownership of elements when using `ptr::read`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A double-free vulnerability can lead to memory corruption, potentially resulting in crashes, denial-of-service, or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user provides a function `f` to `move_elements` that panics.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to control the function `f` passed to `move_elements` such that it causes a panic.
