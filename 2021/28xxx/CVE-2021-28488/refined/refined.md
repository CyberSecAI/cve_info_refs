*   **Weakness:** The web application does not sanitize the `filename` parameter, allowing authenticated users to read arbitrary files using `../`.
*   **Impact:** Authenticated attacker can read arbitrary files on the filesystem.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating the `filename` GET parameter with sequences like "../" in `/oms1350/data/cpb/log`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
        * Authenticated access.

**CVE-2022-40715 - Nokia 1350 OMS Optical Management System**

*   **Root Cause:** Absolute Path Traversal.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of sanitization allows authenticated attackers to read arbitrary files.
*   **Impact:** Remote authenticated users can read arbitrary files from the system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Manipulation of the `logfile` parameter.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
         * Authenticated access.

**CVE-2022-40714 - Nokia 1350 OMS Optical Management System**

*   **Root Cause:** Multiple Reflected Cross-Site Scripting.
*  **Weakness:** Reflected XSS on multiple `/oms1350/` endpoints.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML.
*  **Attack Vector:** Crafted HTTP requests with malicious payloads.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
         * No authentication required.

**CVE-2022-40713 - Nokia 1350 OMS Optical Management System**

*   **Root Cause:** Multiple Relative Path Traversal.
*  **Weakness:** Allows an authenticated attacker to read files on the filesystem arbitrarily.
*   **Impact:** Remote authenticated users can read arbitrary files from the system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Manipulation of the `file` parameter in multiple endpoints.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
         * Authenticated access.

**CVE-2022-40712 - Nokia 1350 OMS Optical Management System**

*   **Root Cause:** Multiple Reflected Cross-Site Scripting.
*  **Weakness:** Reflected XSS on multiple `/cgi-bin/R14.2*` endpoints.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML.
*  **Attack Vector:** Crafted HTTP requests with malicious payloads.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
         * No authentication required.

**CVE-2022-40680 - Fortinet FortiOS**

*  **Root Cause:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting.
*   **Weakness:** The FortiOS web application doesn't check properly the input in replacement messages.
*   **Impact:** A privileged user can inject malicious code that will be executed in the browser of every user who visits the infected page.
*   **Attack Vector:** By modifying replacement messages with a malicious JavaScript payload.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
     *  Privileged user access.

**CVE-2022-39822 - NOKIA NFM-T VM Manager WebUI**

*  **Root Cause:** SQL injection.
*   **Weakness:** The web application is affected by SQL Injection, which allows an attacker to modify query syntax.
*   **Impact:** A remote user, authenticated to the web application, may manipulate the request parameters to exploit error output from the database to manipulate its data.
*   **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the id and host parameters.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * Authenticated user.

**CVE-2022-39821 - Nokia 1350 OMS Optical Management System**

*   **Root Cause:** Insertion
