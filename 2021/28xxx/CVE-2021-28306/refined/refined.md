Based on the provided content, this advisory from rustsec.org (RUSTSEC-2021-0038) is related to CVE-2021-28306, as it is listed as an alias. The advisory describes multiple memory safety issues within the `fltk` crate.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause stems from improper handling of image data and label types within the `fltk` library, specifically within the functions: `fltk::image::Pixmap::new`, `fltk::prelude::WidgetExt::set_label_type`, and `fltk::prelude::WindowExt::set_icon`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **NULL pointer dereference:** Setting a multi label type when an image doesn't exist, and setting a window icon using a non-raster image.
*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The `Pixmap` constructor not validating the correctness of the pixmap data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to memory safety issues, potentially causing program crashes due to NULL pointer dereferences or undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds reads.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors involve manipulating the following `fltk` library functionalities:
* Calling `fltk::image::Pixmap::new` with incorrect pixmap data
* Calling `fltk::prelude::WidgetExt::set_label_type` with a multi label type when the corresponding image does not exist
* Calling `fltk::prelude::WindowExt::set_icon` with a non-raster image

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to call the vulnerable functions within the `fltk` library with specific inputs that trigger the described vulnerabilities. This implies the attacker can control program flow and supply specific parameters to vulnerable functions.
