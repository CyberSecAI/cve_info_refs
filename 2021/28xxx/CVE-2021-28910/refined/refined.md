- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The BAB TECHNOLOGIE GmbH eibPort V3, prior to version 3.9.1, contains a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is an unauthenticated SSRF, allowing attackers to make requests to internal or external servers.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The exploitation of this vulnerability allows for the disclosure of potentially sensitive information from internal resources that the eibPort device has access to.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network by sending crafted requests to the eibPort.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to reach the device over the network.
