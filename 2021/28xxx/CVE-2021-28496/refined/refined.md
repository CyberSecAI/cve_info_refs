- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the exposure of BFD password, configured in shared secret profiles, through eAPI or other JSON outputs to authenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the leakage of sensitive information (BFD passwords) due to insufficient access control when displaying output over eAPI or JSON.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain access to the BFD password, which could potentially allow them to disrupt or intercept network traffic relying on BFD for forwarding detection. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves authenticated access to the device via eAPI or other JSON output methods. The vulnerability is exposed when displaying the BFD password.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the device with the ability to view output via eAPI or JSON.
