```
Root cause of vulnerability:
- On AMD systems, if a discontinuous range of memory is specified in the ACPI firmware, the middle range, which was intended to be excluded from identity mapping, is incorrectly identity-mapped.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Improper access control
- Memory mapping vulnerability

Impact of exploitation:
- Privilege escalation: A malicious guest could potentially gain access to memory it shouldn't have access to.
- Denial of service: Malicious guests can cause a denial of service by exploiting the vulnerability.
- Information leaks: The vulnerability can lead to information leaks due to unauthorized memory access.

Attack vectors:
- The vulnerability is exploitable by guests granted access to physical devices via PCI passthrough.
- A malicious guest with device passthrough can exploit the vulnerability by manipulating the IOMMU page mappings to gain unauthorized access to memory regions.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker must have a guest with access to a physical device via PCI passthrough.
- The attacker must be able to manipulate the device's IOMMU page mappings.
- The target system must be an AMD system with a discontinuous range specified in ACPI firmware.
