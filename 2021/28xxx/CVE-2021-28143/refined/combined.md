(Non-US) DIR-841 :: FW v3.03 & v3.04 :: Authenticated Command Injection LAN-side Vulnerability

**Overview**

On February 1, 2021, a 3rd party security researcher, submitted a report accusing the (non-US) DIR-841 using firmware v3.03 or v3.04 of a LAN-side authenticated command injection exploit.   The Vulnerability was confirmed and a patch was issued too close the reported issue.  Please find the beta/hotfix release below

**3rd Party Report information**

- **Report provided:** Vitor Esperança vitorespf \_at\_ gmail \_dot\_ com

          **- Reference** : TBD updaed with Authors Public Disclosure

- Using the device with firmware 3.0.3 and 3.0.4, it was possible to inject arbitrary commands when using tools available on the web interface such as: ping and traceroute.

- Login in DLINK DIR-841 Web Interface as an admin

- Choose the "System" option.

- Using the ping or traceroute tool, enter the IP in the interface of the chosen tool, and then immediately

   capture the request using the Burp Suite (proxy tool).

- Right after that we can manipulate the host parameter, and insert payloads like:

"'127.0.0.1 & sleep 5'" or "127.0.0.1 & nc target port '".

The sleep command and the nc (netcat) tool will be executed together with the ping / traceroute tool.

**Affected Models**

| **Model** | **Hardware Revision** | **Affected FW** | **Fixed FW** | **Recommendation** | **Last Updated** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DIR-841 | All Hardware Revisions | v3.0.4 & Below | [v3.04 RT819F Hotfix](https://support.dlink.com/resource/SECURITY_ADVISEMENTS/DIR-841/DIR-841_FIRMWARE_v3.0.4_RT8197F_HOTFIX.zip) | Please Download and Update Device | 03/08/2021 |
