- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The eibPort V3 device has an uncontrolled login service at `/webif/SecurityModule` that allows for brute-force attacks due to the lack of rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms. The default username is 'admin' and the password may be weak.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
    - Lack of rate limiting or account lockout on the login service.
    - Usage of a known default username ('admin').
    - Potentially weak passwords.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful brute-force attack can lead to unauthorized access to the device's web interface. This is part of a larger attack chain that can result in gaining SSH root access.
- **Attack vectors**: Unauthenticated remote attackers can perform a brute-force attack against the login service accessible via the network at `/webif/SecurityModule`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires network access to the device. No prior authentication is needed to start the brute-force attack.
