  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The server may receive an invalid large (greater than 17408) TLS frame that is incorrectly handled, causing CPU resources to eventually reach 100% usage.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of large TLS frames"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) due to high CPU usage.",

    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated attacker sending a crafted large TLS frame to the server.",
	 "additional_details": "The vulnerability affects Jetty servers using SSL/TLS with HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, or WebSocket protocols.  A workaround is provided by a custom `SpaceCheckingSslConnectionFactory` class to clear the input buffer and throwing an exception when the encrypted buffer max length is exceeded."
