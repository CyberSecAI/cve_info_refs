- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Display Name" field within the user profile. When a user enters malicious script or HTML into this field, it is stored without filtering. When this field is later displayed in the administration panel, specifically within the "Add a content" section of the Content module, the stored script is executed in the context of the admin user's browser.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application stores unfiltered user input and later displays it to other users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML into an admin's browser session. This can lead to cookie theft, password compromise, or arbitrary code execution within the admin's browser. This allows the attacker to potentially gain control of the application and its underlying system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the "Display Name" field in user profiles. An attacker with a normal user account can inject the malicious payload through the profile editing page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the ImpressCMS installation. The attacker must be able to create an account and edit their user profile.
