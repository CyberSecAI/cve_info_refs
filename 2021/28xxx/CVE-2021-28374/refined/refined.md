Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-28374

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `courier-authlib` package creates the `/run/courier/authdaemon` directory with overly permissive permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Weak Directory Permissions:** The directory `/run/courier/authdaemon` is created with permissions that allow unauthorized users to access it.
- **Information Disclosure:** The `authtest` tool, which is part of the `courier-authlib` package, can be used by normal users to query user database information. This tool reveals details like user IDs, home directories, mail directories, quotas, and password information (hashes, and even cleartext in some configurations). The `authpasswd` tool also has similar issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive user information, including:
    - User existence
    - User IDs (UIDs and GIDs)
    - Home directory paths
    - Mail directory paths
    - Quotas
    - Password information (hashes and potentially cleartext passwords in some specific configurations).
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** The exposed information, particularly password hashes, could be used for further attacks, such as brute-force attempts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** A local user on the system can execute the `authtest` command to query the database.
- **Directory Access:** Any user with access to the `/run/courier/authdaemon` directory and the ability to run `authtest` can obtain user information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Normal user account:** The attacker only needs a normal user account on the system where courier-authlib is installed.
- **Access to `authtest` executable:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the `authtest` program.
- **Access to `/run/courier/authdaemon`:** The attacker needs to be able to read the contents of the directory, which was incorrectly set up with weak permissions.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was present in multiple versions of `courier-authlib` including 0.71.1-1, 0.71.0-1, 0.69.0-2, and 0.66.4-9
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.71.1-2 by tightening the permissions of the `/run/courier/authdaemon` directory and moving `autpasswd`, `authtest`, and `authenumerate` binaries to the `courier-authdaemon` package.
- The maintainer initially considered the severity as "important" but was later changed to "serious" due to the potential impact.
- The `authtest`, `authpasswd` and `authenumerate` utilities were moved to `courier-authdaemon` because they require the daemon to be running to be useful and should not be accessible to regular users.
- The issue also affects Debian 9 (stretch) which was addressed in version `0.66.4-9+deb9u1`.
