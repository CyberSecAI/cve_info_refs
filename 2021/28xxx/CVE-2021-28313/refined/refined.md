The provided content contains information about CVE-2021-28313, along with CVE-2021-28321 and CVE-2021-28322.

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a case-sensitivity issue in the Microsoft Diagnostics Hub Standard Collector Service (Diaghub). The service validates the "scratch directory" path provided by the client using `GetFinalPathNameByHandleW` and `wcsnicmp`.  While Windows has a case-insensitive layer, the underlying NTFS file system is case-sensitive. This discrepancy allows an attacker to bypass the path validation by exploiting junctions or directories with different capitalization when per-directory case sensitivity is enabled (e.g., via WSL or Docker).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The case-sensitivity issue enables a form of directory traversal.  By manipulating the case of the provided path (using junctions or similar), an attacker can trick Diaghub into accessing files outside the intended scratch directory.
*   **Improper File Permission Handling:**  Diaghub performs file operations without impersonating the caller, relying on a custom security mechanism (`Microsoft::DiagnosticsHub::StandardCollector::SecuredDirectory::SecuredDirectory`).  However, the directory traversal flaw allows attackers to bypass this mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **CVE-2021-28313:** Taking over file permissions of existing files.
*   **CVE-2021-28321:** Deleting arbitrary files.
*   **CVE-2021-28322:** Dropping files outside the scratch directory, without control over the content.
*   **Elevation of Privileges:** By combining the file dropping and permission takeover capabilities, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable Microsoft Diagnostics Hub Standard Collector Service.
*   The attacker needs to supply a crafted scratch directory path containing junctions or differently-cased directory names that point outside the intended directory, and where per-directory case sensitivity is enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be an authenticated user on the system.
*   The attacker must have the ability to create junctions or directories with different capitalization. This often means having WSL or Docker installed, or some other method to enable per-directory case sensitivity.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Microsoft released a patch for these vulnerabilities in April 2021.
