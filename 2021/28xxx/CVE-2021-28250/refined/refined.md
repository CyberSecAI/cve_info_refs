Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28250:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the `runpicEhealth` executable having SUID/GUID permissions and performing a switch user operation to the `ehealth` user, while being located in a path where other users have write permissions to a subfolder. This allows any user to create and run a script, which then gets executed with the privileges of the `ehealth` user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250):** The `runpicEhealth` executable runs with SUID/GUID permissions and switches to the `ehealth` user.
-   **Insecure Permissions:** The location of the executable allows modification of subfolders under `/opt`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  An attacker can gain `ehealth` user privileges. This allows an attacker to read, write, start, and stop eHealth application files and processes.

**Attack vectors:**
- A local authenticated user can exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to write to a subfolder within the `/opt` directory, allowing them to create an arbitrary script.
- The attacker then needs to execute the `/prods/smile/bin/runpicEhealth` binary, which will execute the attacker's script with the `ehealth` user's privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local operating system user with the ability to write to a subfolder in `/opt`.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the `/prods/smile/bin/runpicEhealth` executable.
