Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28790:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `swiftlint.path` configuration in the SwiftLint for VS Code extension could be overridden within a workspace settings file. This allowed a malicious workspace to specify an arbitrary executable path for SwiftLint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The extension allowed workspace settings to override the `swiftlint.path` configuration, which should have been restricted. This lack of access control enabled the execution of arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By crafting a malicious workspace configuration, an attacker could force the VS Code extension to execute arbitrary binaries on the victim's machine. This allows the attacker to gain full control of the user's system, steal data, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Workspace:** The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a specially crafted VS Code workspace folder containing the malicious `swiftlint.path` configuration. This could be done through social engineering, such as distributing the workspace in a zip file or through a compromised repository.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to create or modify a VS Code workspace folder configuration file to include a malicious path in `swiftlint.path`.
*   The attacker needs to convince a victim to open the maliciously crafted workspace in VS Code with the vulnerable SwiftLint extension installed.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by [@Ry0taK](https://github.com/Ry0taK) and was fixed in version 1.4.5 of the VS Code extension.
*   The fix involved preventing the `swiftlint.path` configuration from being overridden in workspace settings.
*   The advisory on `vuln.ryotak.me` confirms the vulnerability and provides details of the affected product, versions, vulnerability type, and mitigation.
