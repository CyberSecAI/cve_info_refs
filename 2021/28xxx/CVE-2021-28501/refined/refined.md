- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect use of EOS's AAA APIs by the OpenConfig and TerminAttr agents.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Unrestricted access to the device for local users with `nopassword` configuration when OpenConfig gNMI/gNOI or RESTCONF, or TerminAttr gNMI are enabled.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker with local user access configured with `nopassword` could gain unrestricted access to the device through OpenConfig gNMI/gNOI, RESTCONF or TerminAttr agents.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based exploitation via OpenConfig gNMI/gNOI, RESTCONF or TerminAttr gNMI interfaces.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have a local user account on the device configured with `nopassword`, and network connectivity to the affected device's gNMI, RESTCONF or TerminAttr gNMI interfaces.
