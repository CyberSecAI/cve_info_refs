### @IdanHo **[IdanHo](/IdanHo)** commented [Mar 15, 2021](#issue-831881324)

Reading up to the end of the input string of odd length results in an out-of-bounds read. (this fixes [#5769](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/issues/5769))

FuzzUTF16BEDecoder is one of the 3 fuzzers that are crashing on the majority of cases fed to them by oss-fuzz (50% in this case assuming even distribution of input lengths :p), causing oss-fuzz to assume a failing build, so this is the first part of 3 to eventually making [#5682](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/issues/5682) build again.

Sorry, something went wrong.
