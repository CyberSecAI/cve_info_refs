Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28690:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the mitigation for the TSX Async Abort (TAA) speculative execution vulnerability, which involves setting a non-default value in the `MSR_TSX_CTRL` register to disable TSX, is not restored after an S3 suspend/resume cycle.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Failure to restore the TSX mitigation setting in the `MSR_TSX_CTRL` register after S3 resume.
- Systems that have applied the XSA-305 fix to mitigate TAA are vulnerable if they use S3 suspend/resume.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- After S3 suspend/resume, CPU0 remains vulnerable to TAA, leading to an information leak.
- The severity of the impact is tied to the severity of the underlying TAA vulnerability (XSA-305).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation requires the use of S3 suspend/resume functionality.
- The vulnerability is exposed after using S3 suspend and then resuming operation, leaving the system vulnerable until a reboot.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have the ability to exploit the underlying TAA vulnerability (XSA-305), as this vulnerability re-exposes it after S3 resume.
- The attacker would need to be in a position to exploit the information leak via TAA.
