Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28123:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an undocumented default cryptographic key present in the Cohesity DataPlatform. This key, specifically a default SSH key, allows unauthorized access to the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use of an undocumented default cryptographic key for SSH access.
- Incorrect Access Control: The default SSH key grants access without proper authorization mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain access to the Cohesity DataPlatform cluster's Linux interface with superuser privileges. This grants them complete control over the system.
- The impact includes complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (C:H/I:H/A:H).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote network access to the Cohesity DataPlatform cluster is required.
- Exploitation is done via SSH using the default key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable Cohesity DataPlatform cluster.
- No prior authentication or privileges are required (PR:N).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Cohesity DataPlatform versions 6.3 prior to 6.3.1g, 6.4 up to 6.4.1c, and 6.5.1 through 6.5.1b.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by upgrading the cluster to 6.3.1g or 6.5.1c, or applying a patch if using 6.4.1c
- Restricting SSH access to trusted hosts using the host firewall feature on the Cohesity DataPlatform can also mitigate the issue.
- The vulnerability was discovered by researchers from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.
- The vendor has confirmed and acknowledged the vulnerability.
- CVSS v3.1 score is 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
