Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-28089:

**Root Cause:**
- The `dump_desc()` function in Tor was called incorrectly in several places. This function attempts to dump (potentially unparseable) directory information to disk. However, it was sometimes called with an input that extended beyond the end of the allocated string/buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect function call:** The `dump_desc()` function was called with an input that could extend beyond the string's boundary.
- **Missing length argument:** The `dump_desc()` function lacked a length argument, causing it to process data beyond intended boundaries.
- **Potential Unbounded Read:** This could potentially lead to reading off the end of an allocation, although it's noted this isn't a privacy leak because the data isn't exposed. There's a mention that this may not even be a crash bug due to NUL termination of downloads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending specially crafted directory data with a large number of small, unparseable descriptors, an attacker could force the Tor instance to consume excessive CPU resources while trying to parse the data.
- **Crash:** Although less certain, there was a potential for a crash if an out-of-bounds read occurred.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Sending Directory Data:** Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted directory data to a Tor instance. This is easiest to do against directory authorities since anyone can upload to them. Directory caches could also exploit this against relays or clients when they download.
- **Relay Nickname:** Specifically, the issue mentioned that if a relay is named "directory-signature" it can prevent a consensus and crash authorities, relating to the `strstr()` usage mentioned in the gitlab issue. This may be related to how `dump_desc` uses the input data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send directory data to a Tor instance. This could be achieved via:
    - Directly interacting with directory authorities.
    - By being a directory cache that can manipulate the data it downloads and serves to relays or clients.
- The ability to name a relay with a specific name

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Tor versions 0.3.5 through 0.4.4.
- The fix involved disabling the `dump_desc()` function in versions 0.3.5 through 0.4.4.
- The longer-term fix involved adding a length argument to the `dump_desc()` function.
- This vulnerability was tracked as TROVE-2021-001.
