[v21.01.1](/spdk/spdk/tree/v21.01.1)

[`1f0dd58`](/spdk/spdk/commit/1f0dd58a43b5bc8118b123eca1b07781b052293d)

SPDK 21.01.1 is a bug fix and maintenance LTS release.

# dpdk

Added `rte_ethdev` and `rte_net` dependencies for all builds with DPDK.

Fixed compatibility issues with DPDK 19.11.

# iscsi

A security vulnerability has been identified and fixed in the SPDK iSCSI target.

A TEXT PDU with no data, but CONTINUE flag set, would result in a NULL pointer dereference

and crash the SPDK iSCSI target process. All users of the SPDK iSCSI target

are recommended to update. All SPDK versions <= v21.01 are affected.

# nbd

Fixed kernel hang when bdev is removed by always setting NBD\_SET\_TIMEOUT.

# nvme

Fixed segfault when removing qpair when transport connection fails (issue [#1777](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/issues/1777)).

# ocssd

Fixed the bug that no media event is pushed to the target bdev.

# sock

Added `enable_quickack` and `enable_placement_id` when saving JSON configuration.
