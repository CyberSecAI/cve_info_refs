  - Defacing the web page
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves injecting malicious code through user input fields within the Aimeos module in TYPO3.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A valid backend user account with access to the Aimeos module in TYPO3 is required to exploit this vulnerability.
