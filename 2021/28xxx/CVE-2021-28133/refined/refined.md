Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-28133

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Zoom handles screen sharing of specific application windows. When a user shares a single application window, other meeting participants can briefly see content from other, unshared application windows if those windows overlay the shared one and gain focus. This occurs due to a flaw in how the screen sharing function renders and captures the screen content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere (CWE-668):** The core issue is that screen content from unshared windows is briefly exposed to other meeting participants when it shouldn't be.
- **Information Leakage:** The unintended sharing of screen content can lead to the exposure of sensitive data that users did not intend to share.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Attackers, or even just other meeting participants, could briefly view sensitive data contained in unshared application windows.
- **Data Exfiltration via Recording:** A participant recording the meeting using screen recording software could later review the recording, pause it, and access sensitive information present in those brief frames when the unshared windows were visible.
- **Privacy Breach:** The vulnerability allows for the unintentional viewing of private data, leading to a privacy breach for users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Screen Sharing Functionality:** The attack vector is through the standard "share screen" functionality in Zoom.
- **Overlaying Application Windows:** The attacker does not need any specific access, besides participating in a Zoom call where another participant shares an application window, and then open a new window that overlays the shared window.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Participation in a Zoom Meeting:** The attacker must be a participant in a Zoom meeting where another user is sharing a specific application window.
- **Screen Recording (Optional):** While not necessary to trigger the initial exposure, screen recording greatly enhances the attack's impact by allowing the attacker to capture and review the exposed content at their leisure.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects both Windows and Linux Zoom clients.
- The exposure is brief and may not be immediately noticeable in real-time, but becomes exploitable when the video stream is recorded and analyzed frame-by-frame.
- The vulnerability was initially reported to Zoom on 2020-12-02, with a fix released on 2021-03-23
