My First CVE ID | Proof of Concept (PoC) !

I always wonder how it feels to have a CVE ID assigned to our name & the day finally came to experience the true happiness towards my first CVE ID assignment. Let’s get started with the actual PoC !!

## Product Information

```
Vendor: Seceon Inc.
Product Name: Seceon aiSIEM
Version: 6.3.2
Build: 585
Vulnerability Type: Unauthenticated Account Takeover
Severity: CRITICAL

```
## PoC | Proof of Concept

#1. Go to login page of Seceon aiSIEM and click on “Forgot Password” button. URL - https://192.168.x.x/nextgen/v1/#/login/forgot-password.

#2. Configure any browser with burp suite localhost IP & port to intercept requests/responses.

#3. Open burp suite proxy interceptor, go to “Proxy” tab and ensure Intercept is on.

#4. Now, enter the email address of the victim and click on “Send Reset Link” button.

#5. You will observe the following request in burp suite, click on forward to proceed with the request.

#6. Observe the next request very carefully, here the GET request call is being made to “sendemail” API endpoint along with the password reset (token) link !!

#7. Paste the copied link into the browser and enter the new password for the victim’s SIEM account.

#8. Password is successfully changed and now an attacker can login with a victim’s email address & new password that has been just changed.

## Impact

Any malicious user/attacker can change the credentials of any user/victim with only email address of victim’s account and that results in complete account takeover of the user. Only prerequisite to successful account takeover is email address of the victim.

## Cheers !

The vulnerability got fixed in newer build versions & can not be exploitable further.
