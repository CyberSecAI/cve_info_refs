- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application sends the password reset token in the GET request of the "sendemail" API endpoint. This allows an attacker to intercept and use this token to reset any user's password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Insecure password reset mechanism
    - Exposure of sensitive information in GET request (password reset token)
    - Lack of proper security controls in the password reset process
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can take over any user account by resetting the password using the intercepted password reset token. This leads to complete account takeover.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Network interception using a proxy like Burp Suite to capture the password reset token
    - The attacker needs to initiate a "forgot password" request using the victim's email address
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to intercept network traffic (e.g., using a proxy like Burp Suite)
    - Knowledge of the victim's email address
