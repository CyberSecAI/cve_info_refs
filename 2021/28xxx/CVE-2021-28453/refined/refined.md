{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the parsing of DOC files, specifically due to the lack of validation of an object's existence before performing operations on it.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free vulnerability due to lack of validation of object existence before operations.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a malicious DOC file or a malicious webpage that triggers the vulnerability when processed by Microsoft Word.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious DOC file or host a malicious webpage. The target user must then open the malicious file or visit the malicious webpage. User interaction is required."
