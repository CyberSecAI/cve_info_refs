- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `read_bytes_default_le` function for deserializing arrays of type `T` used `std::mem::uninitialized` to create the array, which could lead to uninitialized memory being dropped if the deserialization method for `T` panicked.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the use of `std::mem::uninitialized` to create an array before its elements are properly initialized. If the deserialization process for an element fails (panics), the program could attempt to drop an object in an uninitialized memory region, leading to undefined behavior.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The impact of this vulnerability includes memory corruption due to the potential dropping of invalid objects.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing byte sequences that, when deserialized by the `read_bytes_default_le` function, will cause the deserialization of an element of an array to panic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to control the input bytes that will be deserialized, which can be over the network with no user interaction.
