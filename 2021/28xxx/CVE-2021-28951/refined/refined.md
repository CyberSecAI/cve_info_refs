Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28951:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a deadlock within the `fs/io_uring.c` file of the Linux kernel. This occurs when the `SQPOLL` thread is created in a disabled state (due to `IORING_SETUP_R_DISABLED` being set during ring creation) and the program exits before explicitly enabling or disabling the thread.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Deadlock:** The primary weakness is a deadlock between the main process exiting and the `SQPOLL` thread. The exiting process waits for the `SQPOLL` thread to park, but the `SQPOLL` thread is waiting to receive a signal to start.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The deadlock causes the affected system to become unresponsive. The process hangs indefinitely as it waits on the `SQPOLL` thread, which itself is waiting for a signal it won't receive.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  A local attacker can trigger the vulnerability by creating an io_uring instance with `IORING_SETUP_SQPOLL` and `IORING_SETUP_R_DISABLED` flags and then exiting without explicitly enabling the polling thread, causing the deadlock.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code that interacts with the `io_uring` interface to trigger the specific conditions to cause the deadlock.

**Additional Details:**

-   The provided commit `3ebba796fa251d042be42b929a2d916ee5c34a49` addresses the issue by ensuring that if the `SQPOLL` thread was created in a disabled state (with `IORING_SETUP_R_DISABLED` set), it will be started before exiting.

- The fix involves clearing `IORING_SETUP_R_DISABLED` flag and completing `sqd->startup` in `io_sq_offload_start` function, as well as starting the offload thread if it is disabled in `io_disable_sqo_submit` function.

-   NetApp's advisory (NTAP-20210430-0003) indicates that several of their products incorporating affected Linux Kernel versions are vulnerable to this issue.

- The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSS score of 5.5
