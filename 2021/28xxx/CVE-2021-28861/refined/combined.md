| I'm not sure this is the exact right fix. It seems that `self.path` is the path provided by the client, from the HTTP request first line. That can be an ugly thing with double slashes, relative components, etc. It also includes an optional query string and fragment.  We convert `self.path` into a local file system path sometimes, by using `self.translate_path()`. That function looks a bit dubious in that it silently ignores path components that are not directories. That's probably out of scope for this issue. AFAICT, `self.path` is always cleaned up before being used as a local path. So sanitizing `self.path` does not seem correct to me since it should retain the value from the request header first line.  Maybe the problem is actually in `urllib.parse.urlunsplit()`. It allows `path` to start with a double-slash but that leads to a URL that doesn't parse correctly. E.g.  ``` >>> urllib.parse.urlunsplit('', '', '//foo', '', '') '//foo' >>> urllib.parse.urlsplit('//foo') SplitResult(scheme='', netloc='foo', path='', query='', fragment='')  ```  We expect an empty 'netloc' and scheme. If `urlunsplit()` removed the extra slashes at the start of the path, I think that would fix the bug. It would have the benefit of fixing other code that uses `urlunsplit()` and sometimes passes paths with double-slash leading paths. |

| Hmm, I still suspect that changing `urlunsplit()` could be the correct fix but it looks scary to make changes there. There must be external code that depends on the `path` argument being treated as a relative reference (i.e. starts with double-slash). The fact that the value is called `url` in the function code suggest that people will pass a relative URI as the path arugment:  ``` def urlunsplit(components):     """Combine the elements of a tuple as returned by urlsplit() into a     complete URL as a string. The data argument can be any five-item iterable.     This may result in a slightly different, but equivalent URL, if the URL that     was parsed originally had unnecessary delimiters (for example, a ? with an     empty query; the RFC states that these are equivalent)."""     scheme, netloc, url, query, fragment, _coerce_result = (                                           _coerce_args(*components))     if netloc or (scheme and scheme in uses_netloc and url[:2] != '//'):         if url and url[:1] != '/': url = '/' + url         url = '//' + (netloc or '') + url     if scheme:         url = scheme + ':' + url     if query:         url = url + '?' + query     if fragment:         url = url + '#' + fragment     return _coerce_result(url)  ```  I think a more minimal fix would be to strip the extra slashes for the data passed to `urlunparse()`, within the `send_head()` function. That should be enough to fix this specific bug. I suspect that `urlunparse()` is being misused (or is misbehaving) in the wild in that it treats the `path` argument as a URL if it starts with a double slash. |

| I created a WIP PR with my alternative approach: [#93894](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93894) . Still needs a little cleanup yet. The change to `urlunparse` needs more consideration. If we want a quick fix before release, I think this PR seems okay. |

| If we want a quick fix before release, I think this PR seems okay.  FWIW there is no need to rush this. Lets spend time to get it right. The issue can become `deferred blocker` and unblock the release. It isn't a showstopper, it's just an old security issue that has been hanging around for a year without enough action. |

While it's good to fix security issues, I would like to repeat the http.server warning in its documentation ;-)

| I think a more minimal fix would be to strip the extra slashes for the data passed to `urlunsplit()`  As a gut feeling, we might want your modification to urlunsplit() regardless of this fix going in. I wonder what that might break? It means a round trip urlunsplit(urlsplit('<https://netloc///path>')) now tackles the leading /s in the middle. Good for this purpose, possibly bad if someone were depending on using it to construct a url with multiple /s in the middle? do we care?  `self.path` in BaseHTTPRequestHandler is merely the second word from a http request command. that can be a full scheme://netloc/path URI, not just a path. The current code doesn't catch that. The urlunsplit() fix approach would. |

`[Revert 30935 defer bpo45162 to 312 (](/python/cpython/commit/1ffde3eb818eadd58f6518f75f0c981b60c2e3ef "Revert 30935 defer bpo45162 to 312 (#94285)

* GH-93444: remove redundant fields from basicblock: b_nofallthrough, b_exit, b_return (GH-93445)

* netrc: Remove unused \"import shlex\" (#93311)

* gh-92886: Fix test that fails when running with `-O` in `test_imaplib.py` (#93237)

* Fix missing word in sys.float_info docstring (GH-93489)

* [doc] Correct a grammatical error in a docstring. (GH-93441)

* gh-93442: Make C++ version of _Py_CAST work with 0/NULL. (#93500)

Add C++ overloads for _Py_CAST_impl() to handle 0/NULL.  This will allow
C++ extensions that pass 0 or NULL to macros using _Py_CAST() to
continue to compile.  Without this, you get an error like:

    invalid ‘static_cast’ from type ‘int’ to type ‘_object*’

The modern way to use a NULL value in C++ is to use nullptr.  However,
we want to not break extensions that do things the old way.

Character ranges with upper bound less that lower bound (e.g. [c-a])

* Grammar fix to socket error string (GH-93523)

* gh-86986: bump min sphinx version to 3.2 (GH-93337)

* gh-79096: Protect cookie file created by {LWP,Mozilla}CookieJar.save() (GH-93463)

Note: This change is not effective on Microsoft Windows.

Cookies can store sensitive information and should therefore be protected
against unauthorized third parties. This is also described in issue #79096.

The filesystem permissions are currently set to 644, everyone can read the
file. This commit changes the permissions to 600, only the creater of the file
can read and modify it. This improves security, because it reduces the attack
surface. Now the attacker needs control of the user that created the cookie or
a ways to circumvent the filesystems permissions.

This change is backwards incompatible. Systems that rely on world-readable
cookies will breake. However, one could argue that those are misconfigured in
the first place.

* gh-93162: Add ability to configure QueueHandler/QueueListener together (GH-93269)

Also, provide getHandlerByName() and getHandlerNames() APIs.

* gh-93584: Make all install+tests targets depends on all (GH-93589)

All install targets use the \"all\" target as synchronization point to
prevent race conditions with PGO builds. PGO builds use recursive make,
which can lead to two parallel `./python setup.py build` processes that
step on each others toes.

\"test\" targets now correctly compile PGO build in a clean repo.

* gh-91317: Document that Path does not collapse initial `//` (GH-32193)

Documentation for `pathlib` says:

> Spurious slashes and single dots are collapsed, but double dots ('..') are not, since this would change the meaning of a path in the face of symbolic links:

However, it omits that initial double slashes also aren't collapsed.

Later, in documentation of `PurePath.drive`, `PurePath.root`, and `PurePath.name` it mentions UNC but:

- this abbreviation says nothing to a person who is unaware about existence of UNC (Wikipedia doesn't help either by [giving a disambiguation page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNC))
- it shows up only if a person needs to use a specific property or decides to fully learn what the module provides.

* gh-79579: Improve DML query detection in sqlite3 (#93623)

The fix involves using pysqlite_check_remaining_sql(), not only to check
for multiple statements, but now also to strip leading comments and
whitespace from SQL statements, so we can improve DML query detection.

pysqlite_check_remaining_sql() is renamed lstrip_sql(), to more
accurately reflect its function, and hardened to handle more SQL comment
corner cases.

* Add test.support.busy_retry() (#93770)

Add busy_retry() and sleeping_retry() functions to test.support.

* gh-87260: Update sqlite3 signature docs to reflect actual implementation (#93840)

Align the docs for the following methods with the actual implementation:

- sqlite3.complete_statement()
- sqlite3.Connection.create_function()
- sqlite3.Connection.create_aggregate()
- sqlite3.Connection.set_progress_handler()

* test_thread uses support.sleeping_retry() (#93849)

test_thread.test_count() now fails if it takes longer than
LONG_TIMEOUT seconds.

* Use support.sleeping_retry() and support.busy_retry() (#93848)

* Replace time.sleep(0.010) with sleeping_retry() to
  use an exponential sleep.

* test_asyncio: run_until() implements exponential sleep (#93866)

run_until() of test.test_asyncio.utils now uses an exponential sleep
delay (max: 1 second), rather than a fixed delay of 1 ms. Similar
design than support.sleeping_retry() wait strategy that applies
exponential backoff.

* test_asyncore: Optimize capture_server() (#93867)

Remove time.sleep(0.01) in test_asyncore capture_server(). The sleep
was redundant and inefficient, since the loop starts with
select.select() which also implements a sleep (poll for socket data
with a timeout).

* Tests call sleeping_retry() with SHORT_TIMEOUT (#93870)

Tests now call busy_retry() and sleeping_retry() with SHORT_TIMEOUT
or LONG_TIMEOUT (of test.support), rather than hardcoded constants.

Add also WAIT_ACTIVE_CHILDREN_TIMEOUT constant to
_test_multiprocessing.

* gh-93820: Fix copy() regression in enum.Flag (GH-93876)

GH-26658 introduced a regression in copy / pickle protocol for combined
`enum.Flag`s. `copy.copy(re.A | re.I)` would fail with
`AttributeError: ASCII|IGNORECASE`.

`enum.Flag` now has a `__reduce_ex__()` method that reduces flags by
combined value, not by combined name.

* Call busy_retry() and sleeping_retry() with error=True (#93871)

Tests no longer call busy_retry() and sleeping_retry() with
error=False: raise an exception if the loop times out.

* gh-87347: Add parenthesis around PyXXX_Check() arguments (#92815)

* gh-91577: SharedMemory move imports out of methods (#91579)

SharedMemory.unlink() uses the unregister() function from resource_tracker. Previously it was imported in the method, but this can fail if the method is called during interpreter shutdown, for example when unlink is part of a __del__() method.

Moving the import to the top of the file, means that the unregister() method is available during interpreter shutdown.

The register call in SharedMemory.__init__() can also use this imported resource_tracker.

* gh-85308: argparse: Use filesystem encoding for arguments file (GH-93277)

* Closes gh-94152: Update pyvideo.org URL (GH-94075)

The URL is now https://pyvideo.org, which uses HTTPS and avoids a redirect.

* gh-91456: [Enum] Deprecate default auto() behavior with mixed value types (GH-91457)

When used with plain Enum, auto() returns the last numeric value assigned, skipping any incompatible member values (such as strings); starting in 3.13 the default auto() for plain Enums will require all the values to be of compatible types, and will return a new value that is 1 higher than any existing value.

* Add an index_pages default list to SimpleHTTPRequestHandler and an
optional constructor parameter that allows the default indexes pages
list to be overridden.  This makes it easy to set a new index page name
without having to override send_head.

* [Enum] Remove automatic docstring generation (GH-94188)

* Add ABI dump script (#94135)

* Add more tests for throwing into yield from (GH-94097)

* gh-94169: Remove deprecated io.OpenWrapper (#94170)

Remove io.OpenWrapper and _pyio.OpenWrapper, deprecated in Python
3.10: just use :func:`open` instead. The open() (io.open()) function
is a built-in function. Since Python 3.10, _pyio.open() is also a
static method.

* gh-94199: Remove ssl.RAND_pseudo_bytes() function (#94202)

Remove the ssl.RAND_pseudo_bytes() function, deprecated in Python
3.6: use os.urandom() or ssl.RAND_bytes() instead.

* gh-94196: Remove gzip.GzipFile.filename attribute (#94197)

gzip: Remove the filename attribute of gzip.GzipFile,
deprecated since Python 2.6, use the name attribute instead. In write
mode, the filename attribute added '.gz' file extension if it was not
present.

* gh-93692: remove \"build finished successfully\" message from setup.py (#93693)

The message was only emitted when the build succeeded _and_ there were
missing modules.

* gh-84461: Fix ctypes and test_ctypes on Emscripten (#94142)

- c_longlong and c_longdouble need experimental WASM bigint.
- Skip tests that need threading
- Define ``CTYPES_MAX_ARGCOUNT`` for Emscripten. libffi-emscripten 2022-06-23 supports up to 1000 args.

* gh-94205: Ensures all required DLLs are copied on Windows for underpth tests (GH-94206)

* gh-84461: Build Emscripten with WASM BigInt support (#94219)

* gh-94172: urllib.request avoids deprecated check_hostname (#94193)

The urllib.request no longer uses the deprecated check_hostname
parameter of the http.client module.

Add private http.client._create_https_context() helper to http.client,
used by urllib.request.

Remove the now redundant check on check_hostname and verify_mode in
http.client: the SSLContext.check_hostname setter already implements
the check.

* IDLE: replace if statement with expression (#94228)

* Docs: Remove `Provides [...]` from `multiprocessing.shared_memory` description (#92761)

* gh-93382: Sync up `co_code` changes with 3.11 (GH-94227)

Sync up co_code changes with 3.11 commit 852b4d4bcd12b0b6839a015a262ce976b134f6f3.

* bpo-46642: Explicitly disallow subclassing of instaces of TypeVar, ParamSpec, etc (GH-31148)

The existing test covering this case passed only incidentally. We
explicitly disallow doing this and add a proper error message.

* bpo-26253: Add compressionlevel to tarfile stream (GH-2962)

`tarfile` already accepts a compressionlevel argument for creating
files. This patch adds the same for stream-based tarfile usage.
The default is 9, the value that was previously hard-coded.

* gh-70441: Fix test_tarfile on systems w/o bz2 (gh-2962) (#94258)

* gh-94199: Remove ssl.match_hostname() function (#94224)

* gh-94207: Fix struct module leak (GH-94239)

Make _struct.Struct a GC type

This fixes a memory leak in the _struct module, where as soon
as a Struct object is stored in the cache, there's a cycle from
the _struct module to the cache to Struct objects to the Struct
type back to the module. If _struct.Struct is not gc-tracked, that
cycle is never collected.

This PR makes _struct.Struct GC-tracked, and adds a regression test.

* gh-94245: Test pickling and copying of typing.Tuple[()] (GH-94259)

* gh-77560: Report possible errors in restoring builtins at finalization (GH-94255)

Seems in the past the copy of builtins was not made in some scenarios,
and the error was silenced. Write it now to stderr, so we have a chance
to see it.

* gh-90016: Reword sqlite3 adapter/converter docs (#93095)

Also add adapters and converter recipes.

* [doc] Correct a grammatical error in a docstring. (GH-93441)

* gh-93442: Make C++ version of _Py_CAST work with 0/NULL. (#93500)

Add C++ overloads for _Py_CAST_impl() to handle 0/NULL.  This will allow
C++ extensions that pass 0 or NULL to macros using _Py_CAST() to
continue to compile.  Without this, you get an error like:

    invalid ‘static_cast’ from type ‘int’ to type ‘_object*’

The modern way to use a NULL value in C++ is to use nullptr.  However,
we want to not break extensions that do things the old way.

Character ranges with upper bound less that lower bound (e.g. [c-a])

* gh-79096: Protect cookie file created by {LWP,Mozilla}CookieJar.save() (GH-93463)

Note: This change is not effective on Microsoft Windows.

Cookies can store sensitive information and should therefore be protected
against unauthorized third parties. This is also described in issue #79096.

The filesystem permissions are currently set to 644, everyone can read the
file. This commit changes the permissions to 600, only the creater of the file
can read and modify it. This improves security, because it reduces the attack
surface. Now the attacker needs control of the user that created the cookie or
a ways to circumvent the filesystems permissions.

This change is backwards incompatible. Systems that rely on world-readable
cookies will breake. However, one could argue that those are misconfigured in
the first place.

* gh-93461: Invalidate sys.path_importer_cache entries with relative paths (GH-93653)

* gh-91317: Document that Path does not collapse initial `//` (GH-32193)

Documentation for `pathlib` says:

> Spurious slashes and single dots are collapsed, but double dots ('..') are not, since this would change the meaning of a path in the face of symbolic links:

However, it omits that initial double slashes also aren't collapsed.

Later, in documentation of `PurePath.drive`, `PurePath.root`, and `PurePath.name` it mentions UNC but:

- this abbreviation says nothing to a person who is unaware about existence of UNC (Wikipedia doesn't help either by [giving a disambiguation page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNC))
- it shows up only if a person needs to use a specific property or decides to fully learn what the module provides.

and mark a test as \"environment changed\" if a test leaks a temporary
file or directory.

* gh-79579: Improve DML query detection in sqlite3 (#93623)

The fix involves using pysqlite_check_remaining_sql(), not only to check
for multiple statements, but now also to strip leading comments and
whitespace from SQL statements, so we can improve DML query detection.

pysqlite_check_remaining_sql() is renamed lstrip_sql(), to more
accurately reflect its function, and hardened to handle more SQL comment
corner cases.

* Add test.support.busy_retry() (#93770)

Add busy_retry() and sleeping_retry() functions to test.support.

* gh-87260: Update sqlite3 signature docs to reflect actual implementation (#93840)

Align the docs for the following methods with the actual implementation:

- sqlite3.complete_statement()
- sqlite3.Connection.create_function()
- sqlite3.Connection.create_aggregate()
- sqlite3.Connection.set_progress_handler()

* test_thread uses support.sleeping_retry() (#93849)

test_thread.test_count() now fails if it takes longer than
LONG_TIMEOUT seconds.

* Use support.sleeping_retry() and support.busy_retry() (#93848)

* Replace time.sleep(0.010) with sleeping_retry() to
  use an exponential sleep.
* support.wait_process(): reuse sleeping_retry().

* GH-93850: Fix test_asyncio exception ignored tracebacks (#93854)

* gh-93824: Reenable installation of shell extension on Windows ARM64 (GH-93825)

* test_asyncio: run_until() implements exponential sleep (#93866)

run_until() of test.test_asyncio.utils now uses an exponential sleep
delay (max: 1 second), rather than a fixed delay of 1 ms. Similar
design than support.sleeping_retry() wait strategy that applies
exponential backoff.

* test_asyncore: Optimize capture_server() (#93867)

Remove time.sleep(0.01) in test_asyncore capture_server(). The sleep
was redundant and inefficient, since the loop starts with
select.select() which also implements a sleep (poll for socket data
with a timeout).

* Tests call sleeping_retry() with SHORT_TIMEOUT (#93870)

Tests now call busy_retry() and sleeping_retry() with SHORT_TIMEOUT
or LONG_TIMEOUT (of test.support), rather than hardcoded constants.

Add also WAIT_ACTIVE_CHILDREN_TIMEOUT constant to
_test_multiprocessing.

* gh-93820: Fix copy() regression in enum.Flag (GH-93876)

GH-26658 introduced a regression in copy / pickle protocol for combined
`enum.Flag`s. `copy.copy(re.A | re.I)` would fail with
`AttributeError: ASCII|IGNORECASE`.

`enum.Flag` now has a `__reduce_ex__()` method that reduces flags by
combined value, not by combined name.

* Call busy_retry() and sleeping_retry() with error=True (#93871)

Tests no longer call busy_retry() and sleeping_retry() with
error=False: raise an exception if the loop times out.

* gh-87347: Add parenthesis around PyXXX_Check() arguments (#92815)

* gh-91321: Fix test_cppext for C++03 (#93902)

testing C++03: only use this compiler flag with C++11.

* gh-91577: SharedMemory move imports out of methods (#91579)

SharedMemory.unlink() uses the unregister() function from resource_tracker. Previously it was imported in the method, but this can fail if the method is called during interpreter shutdown, for example when unlink is part of a __del__() method.

Moving the import to the top of the file, means that the unregister() method is available during interpreter shutdown.

The register call in SharedMemory.__init__() can also use this imported resource_tracker.

with OSError(\"AF_UNIX path too long\") if the temporary directory (the
TMPDIR environment variable) is too long.

Remove io.OpenWrapper and _pyio.OpenWrapper, deprecated in Python
3.10: just use :func:`open` instead. The open() (io.open()) function
is a built-in function. Since Python 3.10, _pyio.open() is also a
static method.

* gh-94199: Remove ssl.RAND_pseudo_bytes() function (#94202)

Remove the ssl.RAND_pseudo_bytes() function, deprecated in Python
3.6: use os.urandom() or ssl.RAND_bytes() instead.

The urllib.request no longer uses the deprecated check_hostname
parameter of the http.client module.

Add private http.client._create_https_context() helper to http.client,
used by urllib.request.

Remove the now redundant check on check_hostname and verify_mode in
http.client: the SSLContext.check_hostname setter already implements
the check.

* gh-94199: Remove ssl.match_hostname() function (#94224)

* gh-94207: Fix struct module leak (GH-94239)

Make _struct.Struct a GC type

This fixes a memory leak in the _struct module, where as soon
as a Struct object is stored in the cache, there's a cycle from
the _struct module to the cache to Struct objects to the Struct
type back to the module. If _struct.Struct is not gc-tracked, that
cycle is never collected.

This PR makes _struct.Struct GC-tracked, and adds a regression test.

* gh-94245: Test pickling and copying of typing.Tuple[()] (GH-94259)

* gh-77560: Report possible errors in restoring builtins at finalization (GH-94255)

Seems in the past the copy of builtins was not made in some scenarios,
and the error was silenced. Write it now to stderr, so we have a chance
to see it.

Add C++ overloads for _Py_CAST_impl() to handle 0/NULL.  This will allow
C++ extensions that pass 0 or NULL to macros using _Py_CAST() to
continue to compile.  Without this, you get an error like:

    invalid ‘static_cast’ from type ‘int’ to type ‘_object*’

The modern way to use a NULL value in C++ is to use nullptr.  However,
we want to not break extensions that do things the old way.

* [gh-79096](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/79096): Protect cookie file created by {LWP,Mozilla}CookieJar.save() ([GH-93463](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93463))

Note: This change is not effective on Microsoft Windows.

Cookies can store sensitive information and should therefore be protected
against unauthorized third parties. This is also described in issue [#79096](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/79096).

The filesystem permissions are currently set to 644, everyone can read the
file. This commit changes the permissions to 600, only the creater of the file
can read and modify it. This improves security, because it reduces the attack
surface. Now the attacker needs control of the user that created the cookie or
a ways to circumvent the filesystems permissions.

This change is backwards incompatible. Systems that rely on world-readable
cookies will breake. However, one could argue that those are misconfigured in
the first place.

* [gh-93162](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93162): Add ability to configure QueueHandler/QueueListener together ([GH-93269](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93269))

All install targets use the "all" target as synchronization point to

Documentation for `pathlib` says:

> Spurious slashes and single dots are collapsed, but double dots ('..') are not, since this would change the meaning of a path in the face of symbolic links:

However, it omits that initial double slashes also aren't collapsed.

Later, in documentation of `PurePath.drive`, `PurePath.root`, and `PurePath.name` it mentions UNC but:

- this abbreviation says nothing to a person who is unaware about existence of UNC (Wikipedia doesn't help either by [giving a disambiguation page](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNC>))
- it shows up only if a person needs to use a specific property or decides to fully learn what the module provides.

The fix involves using pysqlite_check_remaining_sql(), not only to check
for multiple statements, but now also to strip leading comments and
whitespace from SQL statements, so we can improve DML query detection.

pysqlite_check_remaining_sql() is renamed lstrip_sql(), to more
accurately reflect its function, and hardened to handle more SQL comment
corner cases.

- In Modules/_sqlite/microprotocols.c, use PyTuple_Pack

* Add test.support.busy_retry() ([#93770](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93770))

Add busy_retry() and sleeping_retry() functions to test.support.

* [gh-87260](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/87260): Update sqlite3 signature docs to reflect actual implementation ([#93840](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93840))

Align the docs for the following methods with the actual implementation:

- sqlite3.complete_statement()
- sqlite3.Connection.create_function()
- sqlite3.Connection.create_aggregate()
- sqlite3.Connection.set_progress_handler()

* test_thread uses support.sleeping_retry() ([#93849](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93849))

test_thread.test_count() now fails if it takes longer than
LONG_TIMEOUT seconds.

* Use support.sleeping_retry() and support.busy_retry() ([#93848](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93848))

* Replace time.sleep(0.010) with sleeping_retry() to
  use an exponential sleep.
* support.wait_process(): reuse sleeping_retry().
* _test_eintr: remove unused variables.

* test_asyncio: run_until() implements exponential sleep ([#93866](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93866))

run_until() of test.test_asyncio.utils now uses an exponential sleep
delay (max: 1 second), rather than a fixed delay of 1 ms. Similar
design than support.sleeping_retry() wait strategy that applies
exponential backoff.

* test_asyncore: Optimize capture_server() ([#93867](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93867))

Remove time.sleep(0.01) in test_asyncore capture_server(). The sleep
was redundant and inefficient, since the loop starts with
select.select() which also implements a sleep (poll for socket data
with a timeout).

* Tests call sleeping_retry() with SHORT_TIMEOUT ([#93870](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93870))

Tests now call busy_retry() and sleeping_retry() with SHORT_TIMEOUT
or LONG_TIMEOUT (of test.support), rather than hardcoded constants.

Add also WAIT_ACTIVE_CHILDREN_TIMEOUT constant to
_test_multiprocessing.

* [gh-93820](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93820): Fix copy() regression in enum.Flag ([GH-93876](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93876))

[GH-26658](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/26658) introduced a regression in copy / pickle protocol for combined
`enum.Flag`s. `copy.copy(re.A | re.I)` would fail with
`AttributeError: ASCII|IGNORECASE`.

`enum.Flag` now has a `__reduce_ex__()` method that reduces flags by
combined value, not by combined name.

* Call busy_retry() and sleeping_retry() with error=True ([#93871](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93871))

Tests no longer call busy_retry() and sleeping_retry() with
error=False: raise an exception if the loop times out.

Don't build _testcppext.cpp with -Wzero-as-null-pointer-constant when
testing C++03: only use this compiler flag with C++11.

* [gh-91577](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/91577): SharedMemory move imports out of methods ([#91579](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/91579))

SharedMemory.unlink() uses the unregister() function from resource_tracker. Previously it was imported in the method, but this can fail if the method is called during interpreter shutdown, for example when unlink is part of a __del__() method.

Moving the import to the top of the file, means that the unregister() method is available during interpreter shutdown.

The register call in SharedMemory.__init__() can also use this imported resource_tracker.

Closes [#93675](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93675)

* Minor optimization for Fractions.limit_denominator ([GH-93730](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93730))

When we construct the upper and lower candidates in limit_denominator,
the numerator and denominator are already relatively prime (and the
denominator positive) by construction, so there's no need to go through
the usual normalisation in the constructor. This saves a couple of
potentially expensive gcd calls.

When used with plain Enum, auto() returns the last numeric value assigned, skipping any incompatible member values (such as strings); starting in 3.13 the default auto() for plain Enums will require all the values to be of compatible types, and will return a new value that is 1 higher than any existing value.

The urllib.request no longer uses the deprecated check_hostname
parameter of the http.client module.

Add private http.client._create_https_context() helper to http.client,
used by urllib.request.

Remove the now redundant check on check_hostname and verify_mode in

the check.

Make _struct.Struct a GC type

This fixes a memory leak in the _struct module, where as soon
as a Struct object is stored in the cache, there's a cycle from
the _struct module to the cache to Struct objects to the Struct
type back to the module. If _struct.Struct is not gc-tracked, that
cycle is never collected.

This PR makes _struct.Struct GC-tracked, and adds a regression test.

to see it.

This patch make following change for coverage-report-server.py
- using uri `./{name}` from root in the old version python http.server can be handled as `//{name}`. But due to https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93879, it will be handled as `/{name}` now.

So I want to use a prefix to avoid double slashes issue.

### **[nascheme](/nascheme)** commented [Jun 16, 2022](#issuecomment-1157309385)

| I'm not sure this is the exact right fix. It seems that `self.path` is the path provided by the client, from the HTTP request first line. That can be an ugly thing with double slashes, relative components, etc. It also includes an optional query string and fragment.  We convert `self.path` into a local file system path sometimes, by using `self.translate_path()`. That function looks a bit dubious in that it silently ignores path components that are not directories. That's probably out of scope for this issue. AFAICT, `self.path` is always cleaned up before being used as a local path. So sanitizing `self.path` does not seem correct to me since it should retain the value from the request header first line.  Maybe the problem is actually in `urllib.parse.urlunsplit()`. It allows `path` to start with a double-slash but that leads to a URL that doesn't parse correctly. E.g.  ``` >>> urllib.parse.urlunsplit('', '', '//foo', '', '') '//foo' >>> urllib.parse.urlsplit('//foo') SplitResult(scheme='', netloc='foo', path='', query='', fragment='')  ```  We expect an empty 'netloc' and scheme. If `urlunsplit()` removed the extra slashes at the start of the path, I think that would fix the bug. It would have the benefit of fixing other code that uses `urlunsplit()` and sometimes passes paths with double-slash leading paths. |

| Hmm, I still suspect that changing `urlunsplit()` could be the correct fix but it looks scary to make changes there. There must be external code that depends on the `path` argument being treated as a relative reference (i.e. starts with double-slash). The fact that the value is called `url` in the function code suggest that people will pass a relative URI as the path arugment:  ``` def urlunsplit(components):     """Combine the elements of a tuple as returned by urlsplit() into a     complete URL as a string. The data argument can be any five-item iterable.     This may result in a slightly different, but equivalent URL, if the URL that     was parsed originally had unnecessary delimiters (for example, a ? with an     empty query; the RFC states that these are equivalent)."""     scheme, netloc, url, query, fragment, _coerce_result = (                                           _coerce_args(*components))     if netloc or (scheme and scheme in uses_netloc and url[:2] != '//'):         if url and url[:1] != '/': url = '/' + url         url = '//' + (netloc or '') + url     if scheme:         url = scheme + ':' + url     if query:         url = url + '?' + query     if fragment:         url = url + '#' + fragment     return _coerce_result(url)  ```  I think a more minimal fix would be to strip the extra slashes for the data passed to `urlunparse()`, within the `send_head()` function. That should be enough to fix this specific bug. I suspect that `urlunparse()` is being misused (or is misbehaving) in the wild in that it treats the `path` argument as a URL if it starts with a double slash. |

| If we want a quick fix before release, I think this PR seems okay.  FWIW there is no need to rush this. Lets spend time to get it right. The issue can become `deferred blocker` and unblock the release. It isn't a showstopper, it's just an old security issue that has been hanging around for a year without enough action. |

While it's good to fix security issues, I would like to repeat the http.server warning in its documentation ;-)

| I think a more minimal fix would be to strip the extra slashes for the data passed to `urlunsplit()`  As a gut feeling, we might want your modification to urlunsplit() regardless of this fix going in. I wonder what that might break? It means a round trip urlunsplit(urlsplit('<https://netloc///path>')) now tackles the leading /s in the middle. Good for this purpose, possibly bad if someone were depending on using it to construct a url with multiple /s in the middle? do we care?  `self.path` in BaseHTTPRequestHandler is merely the second word from a http request command. that can be a full scheme://netloc/path URI, not just a path. The current code doesn't catch that. The urlunsplit() fix approach would. |

`[Revert 30935 defer bpo45162 to 312 (](/python/cpython/commit/1ffde3eb818eadd58f6518f75f0c981b60c2e3ef "Revert 30935 defer bpo45162 to 312 (#94285)

* netrc: Remove unused \"import shlex\" (#93311)

* gh-92886: Fix test that fails when running with `-O` in `test_imaplib.py` (#93237)

* [doc] Correct a grammatical error in a docstring. (GH-93441)

* gh-93442: Make C++ version of _Py_CAST work with 0/NULL. (#93500)

Add C++ overloads for _Py_CAST_impl() to handle 0/NULL.  This will allow
C++ extensions that pass 0 or NULL to macros using _Py_CAST() to
continue to compile.  Without this, you get an error like:

    invalid ‘static_cast’ from type ‘int’ to type ‘_object*’

The modern way to use a NULL value in C++ is to use nullptr.  However,
we want to not break extensions that do things the old way.

Note: This change is not effective on Microsoft Windows.

Cookies can store sensitive information and should therefore be protected
against unauthorized third parties. This is also described in issue #79096.

The filesystem permissions are currently set to 644, everyone can read the
file. This commit changes the permissions to 600, only the creater of the file
can read and modify it. This improves security, because it reduces the attack
surface. Now the attacker needs control of the user that created the cookie or
a ways to circumvent the filesystems permissions.

This change is backwards incompatible. Systems that rely on world-readable
cookies will breake. However, one could argue that those are misconfigured in
the first place.

* gh-91317: Document that Path does not collapse initial `//` (GH-32193)

Documentation for `pathlib` says:

> Spurious slashes and single dots are collapsed, but double dots ('..') are not, since this would change the meaning of a path in the face of symbolic links:

However, it omits that initial double slashes also aren't collapsed.

Later, in documentation of `PurePath.drive`, `PurePath.root`, and `PurePath.name` it mentions UNC but:

- this abbreviation says nothing to a person who is unaware about existence of UNC (Wikipedia doesn't help either by [giving a disambiguation page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNC))
- it shows up only if a person needs to use a specific property or decides to fully learn what the module provides.

and mark a test as \"environment changed\" if a test leaks a temporary
file or directory.

* gh-79579: Improve DML query detection in sqlite3 (#93623)

The fix involves using pysqlite_check_remaining_sql(), not only to check
for multiple statements, but now also to strip leading comments and
whitespace from SQL statements, so we can improve DML query detection.

pysqlite_check_remaining_sql() is renamed lstrip_sql(), to more
accurately reflect its function, and hardened to handle more SQL comment
corner cases.

* GH-93678: reduce boilerplate and code repetition in the compiler (GH-93682)

run_until() of test.test_asyncio.utils now uses an exponential sleep
delay (max: 1 second), rather than a fixed delay of 1 ms. Similar
design than support.sleeping_retry() wait strategy that applies
exponential backoff.

* test_asyncore: Optimize capture_server() (#93867)

Remove time.sleep(0.01) in test_asyncore capture_server(). The sleep
was redundant and inefficient, since the loop starts with
select.select() which also implements a sleep (poll for socket data
with a timeout).

* Tests call sleeping_retry() with SHORT_TIMEOUT (#93870)

Tests now call busy_retry() and sleeping_retry() with SHORT_TIMEOUT

GH-26658 introduced a regression in copy / pickle protocol for combined

`AttributeError: ASCII|IGNORECASE`.

`enum.Flag` now has a `__reduce_ex__()` method that reduces flags by
combined value, not by combined name.

* Call busy_retry() and sleeping_retry() with error=True (#93871)

Tests no longer call busy_retry() and sleeping_retry() with
error=False: raise an exception if the loop times out.

* gh-91321: Fix test_cppext for C++03 (#93902)

Don't build _testcppext.cpp with -Wzero-as-null-pointer-constant when
testing C++03: only use this compiler flag with C++11.

* gh-91577: SharedMemory move imports out of methods (#91579)

SharedMemory.unlink() uses the unregister() function from resource_tracker. Previously it was imported in the method, but this can fail if the method is called during interpreter shutdown, for example when unlink is part of a __del__() method.

Moving the import to the top of the file, means that the unregister() method is available during interpreter shutdown.

The register call in SharedMemory.__init__() can also use this imported resource_tracker.

Revert \"bpo-23689: re module, fix memory leak when a match is terminated by a signal or memory allocation failure (GH-32283)\"

This reverts commit 6e3eee5c11b539e9aab39cff783acf57838c355a.

* gh-89745: Avoid exact match when comparing program_name in test_embed on Windows (GH-93888)

* gh-93852: Add test.support.create_unix_domain_name() (#93914)

test_asyncio, test_logging, test_socket and test_socketserver now
create AF_UNIX domains in the current directory to no longer fail
with OSError(\"AF_UNIX path too long\") if the temporary directory (the
TMPDIR environment variable) is too long.

Modify the following tests to use create_unix_domain_name():

* test_asyncio

* gh-77782: Deprecate global configuration variable (#93943)

Deprecate global configuration variable like
Py_IgnoreEnvironmentFlag: the Py_InitializeFromConfig() API should be
instead.

Fix declaration of Py_GETENV(): use PyAPI_FUNC(), not PyAPI_DATA().

* gh-92611: Add details on replacements for cgi utility funcs (GH-92792)

Per @brettcannon 's [suggestions on the Discourse thread](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-594-take-2-removing-dead-batteries-from-the-standard-library/13508/51), discussed in #92611 and as a followup to PR #92612 , this PR add additional specific per-function replacement information for the utility functions in the `cgi` module deprecated by PEP 594 (PEP-594).

@brettcannon , should this be backported (without the `deprecated-removed` , which I would update it accordingly and re-add in my other PR adding that to the others for 3.11+), or just go in 3.11+?

potentially expensive gcd calls.

the _struct module to the cache to Struct objects to the Struct
type back to the module. If _struct.Struct is not gc-tracked, that

* GH-93444: remove redundant fields from basicblock: b_nofallthrough, b_exit, b_return (GH-93445)

* netrc: Remove unused \"import shlex\" (#93311)

* gh-92886: Fix test that fails when running with `-O` in `test_imaplib.py` (#93237)

* Fix missing word in sys.float_info docstring (GH-93489)

* [doc] Correct a grammatical error in a docstring. (GH-93441)

* gh-93442: Make C++ version of _Py_CAST work with 0/NULL. (#93500)

Add C++ overloads for _Py_CAST_impl() to handle 0/NULL.  This will allow
C++ extensions that pass 0 or NULL to macros using _Py_CAST() to
continue to compile.  Without this, you get an error like:

    invalid ‘static_cast’ from type ‘int’ to type ‘_object*’

The modern way to use a NULL value in C++ is to use nullptr.  However,
we want to not break extensions that do things the old way.

* gh-90473: wasmtime does not support absolute symlinks (GH-93490)

Character ranges with upper bound less that lower bound (e.g. [c-a])
are now interpreted as empty ranges, for compatibility with other glob
pattern implementations. Previously it was re.error.

* gh-79096: Protect cookie file created by {LWP,Mozilla}CookieJar.save() (GH-93463)

Note: This change is not effective on Microsoft Windows.

Cookies can store sensitive information and should therefore be protected
against unauthorized third parties. This is also described in issue #79096.

The filesystem permissions are currently set to 644, everyone can read the
file. This commit changes the permissions to 600, only the creater of the file
can read and modify it. This improves security, because it reduces the attack
surface. Now the attacker needs control of the user that created the cookie or
a ways to circumvent the filesystems permissions.

This change is backwards incompatible. Systems that rely on world-readable
cookies will breake. However, one could argue that those are misconfigured in
the first place.

* gh-93162: Add ability to configure QueueHandler/QueueListener together (GH-93269)

All install targets use the \"all\" target as synchronization point to
prevent race conditions with PGO builds. PGO builds use recursive make,
which can lead to two parallel `./python setup.py build` processes that
step on each others toes.

\"test\" targets now correctly compile PGO build in a clean repo.

* gh-91317: Document that Path does not collapse initial `//` (GH-32193)

Documentation for `pathlib` says:

> Spurious slashes and single dots are collapsed, but double dots ('..') are not, since this would change the meaning of a path in the face of symbolic links:

However, it omits that initial double slashes also aren't collapsed.

Later, in documentation of `PurePath.drive`, `PurePath.root`, and `PurePath.name` it mentions UNC but:

- this abbreviation says nothing to a person who is unaware about existence of UNC (Wikipedia doesn't help either by [giving a disambiguation page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNC))
- it shows up only if a person needs to use a specific property or decides to fully learn what the module provides.

* gh-93741: Add private C API _PyImport_GetModuleAttrString() (GH-93742)

It combines PyImport_ImportModule() and PyObject_GetAttrString()
and saves 4-6 lines of code on every use.

Add also _PyImport_GetModuleAttr() which takes Python strings as arguments.

* gh-79512: Fixed names and __module__ value of weakref classes (GH-93719)

Classes ReferenceType, ProxyType and CallableProxyType have now correct
atrtributes __module__, __name__ and __qualname__.
It makes them (types, not instances) pickleable.

* gh-91810: Fix regression with writing an XML declaration with encoding='unicode' (GH-93426)

* gh-91321: Fix compatibility with C++ older than C++11 (#93784)

Fix the compatibility of the Python C API with C++ older than C++11.

* gh-93353: regrtest checks for leaked temporary files (#93776)

When running tests with -jN, create a temporary directory per process
and mark a test as \"environment changed\" if a test leaks a temporary
file or directory.

* gh-79579: Improve DML query detection in sqlite3 (#93623)

The fix involves using pysqlite_check_remaining_sql(), not only to check
for multiple statements, but now also to strip leading comments and
whitespace from SQL statements, so we can improve DML query detection.

pysqlite_check_remaining_sql() is renamed lstrip_sql(), to more
accurately reflect its function, and hardened to handle more SQL comment
corner cases.

* GH-93678: reduce boilerplate and code repetition in the compiler (GH-93682)

* gh-91877: Fix WriteTransport.get_write_buffer_{limits,size} docs (#92338)

Add busy_retry() and sleeping_retry() functions to test.support.

* gh-87260: Update sqlite3 signature docs to reflect actual implementation (#93840)

Align the docs for the following methods with the actual implementation:

- sqlite3.complete_statement()

- sqlite3.Connection.create_aggregate()
- sqlite3.Connection.set_progress_handler()

* test_thread uses support.sleeping_retry() (#93849)

test_thread.test_count() now fails if it takes longer than
LONG_TIMEOUT seconds.

* Use support.sleeping_retry() and support.busy_retry() (#93848)

* Replace time.sleep(0.010) with sleeping_retry() to

* GH-93850: Fix test_asyncio exception ignored tracebacks (#93854)

* gh-93824: Reenable installation of shell extension on Windows ARM64 (GH-93825)

* test_asyncio: run_until() implements exponential sleep (#93866)

run_until() of test.test_asyncio.utils now uses an exponential sleep
delay (max: 1 second), rather than a fixed delay of 1 ms. Similar
design than support.sleeping_retry() wait strategy that applies
exponential backoff.

* test_asyncore: Optimize capture_server() (#93867)

Remove time.sleep(0.01) in test_asyncore capture_server(). The sleep
was redundant and inefficient, since the loop starts with
select.select() which also implements a sleep (poll for socket data
with a timeout).

* Tests call sleeping_retry() with SHORT_TIMEOUT (#93870)

Tests now call busy_retry() and sleeping_retry() with SHORT_TIMEOUT
or LONG_TIMEOUT (of test.support), rather than hardcoded constants.

Add also WAIT_ACTIVE_CHILDREN_TIMEOUT constant to
_test_multiprocessing.

* gh-84461: Document how to install SDKs manually (GH-93844)

* gh-93820: Fix copy() regression in enum.Flag (GH-93876)

GH-26658 introduced a regression in copy / pickle protocol for combined
`enum.Flag`s. `copy.copy(re.A | re.I)` would fail with
`AttributeError: ASCII|IGNORECASE`.

`enum.Flag` now has a `__reduce_ex__()` method that reduces flags by
combined value, not by combined name.

* Call busy_retry() and sleeping_retry() with error=True (#93871)

Tests no longer call busy_retry() and sleeping_retry() with
error=False: raise an exception if the loop times out.

* gh-87347: Add parenthesis around PyXXX_Check() arguments (#92815)

* gh-91321: Fix test_cppext for C++03 (#93902)

Don't build _testcppext.cpp with -Wzero-as-null-pointer-constant when
testing C++03: only use this compiler flag with C++11.

* gh-91577: SharedMemory move imports out of methods (#91579)

SharedMemory.unlink() uses the unregister() function from resource_tracker. Previously it was imported in the method, but this can fail if the method is called during interpreter shutdown, for example when unlink is part of a __del__() method.

Moving the import to the top of the file, means that the unregister() method is available during interpreter shutdown.

the usual normalisation in the constructor. This saves a couple of
potentially expensive gcd calls.

Make _struct.Struct a GC type

This fixes a memory leak in the _struct module, where as soon

the _struct module to the cache to Struct objects to the Struct
type back to the module. If _struct.Struct is not gc-tracked, that
cycle is never collected.

```
* [GH-93444](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93444): remove redundant fields from basicblock: b_nofallthrough, b_exit, b_return ([GH-93445](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93445))

* [gh-93442](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93442): Make C++ version of _Py_CAST work with 0/NULL. ([#93500](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93500))

Add C++ overloads for _Py_CAST_impl() to handle 0/NULL.  This will allow
C++ extensions that pass 0 or NULL to macros using _Py_CAST() to
continue to compile.  Without this, you get an error like:

    invalid ‘static_cast’ from type ‘int’ to type ‘_object*’

The modern way to use a NULL value in C++ is to use nullptr.  However,
we want to not break extensions that do things the old way.

* [gh-79096](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/79096): Protect cookie file created by {LWP,Mozilla}CookieJar.save() ([GH-93463](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93463))

Note: This change is not effective on Microsoft Windows.

Cookies can store sensitive information and should therefore be protected
against unauthorized third parties. This is also described in issue [#79096](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/79096).

The filesystem permissions are currently set to 644, everyone can read the
file. This commit changes the permissions to 600, only the creater of the file
can read and modify it. This improves security, because it reduces the attack
surface. Now the attacker needs control of the user that created the cookie or
a ways to circumvent the filesystems permissions.

This change is backwards incompatible. Systems that rely on world-readable
cookies will breake. However, one could argue that those are misconfigured in
the first place.

All install targets use the "all" target as synchronization point to
prevent race conditions with PGO builds. PGO builds use recursive make,
which can lead to two parallel `./python setup.py build` processes that
step on each others toes.

"test" targets now correctly compile PGO build in a clean repo.

Documentation for `pathlib` says:

> Spurious slashes and single dots are collapsed, but double dots ('..') are not, since this would change the meaning of a path in the face of symbolic links:

However, it omits that initial double slashes also aren't collapsed.

Later, in documentation of `PurePath.drive`, `PurePath.root`, and `PurePath.name` it mentions UNC but:

- this abbreviation says nothing to a person who is unaware about existence of UNC (Wikipedia doesn't help either by [giving a disambiguation page](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNC>))
- it shows up only if a person needs to use a specific property or decides to fully learn what the module provides.

When running tests with -jN, create a temporary directory per process
and mark a test as "environment changed" if a test leaks a temporary
file or directory.

* [gh-79579](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/79579): Improve DML query detection in sqlite3 ([#93623](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93623))

The fix involves using pysqlite_check_remaining_sql(), not only to check
for multiple statements, but now also to strip leading comments and
whitespace from SQL statements, so we can improve DML query detection.

pysqlite_check_remaining_sql() is renamed lstrip_sql(), to more
accurately reflect its function, and hardened to handle more SQL comment
corner cases.

* [gh-93829](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93829): In sqlite3, replace Py_BuildValue with faster APIs ([#93830](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93830))

- In Modules/_sqlite/connection.c, use PyLong_FromLong
- In Modules/_sqlite/microprotocols.c, use PyTuple_Pack

* Add test.support.busy_retry() ([#93770](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93770))

Add busy_retry() and sleeping_retry() functions to test.support.

* [gh-87260](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/87260): Update sqlite3 signature docs to reflect actual implementation ([#93840](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93840))

Align the docs for the following methods with the actual implementation:

- sqlite3.complete_statement()
- sqlite3.Connection.create_function()
- sqlite3.Connection.create_aggregate()
- sqlite3.Connection.set_progress_handler()

* test_thread uses support.sleeping_retry() ([#93849](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93849))

test_thread.test_count() now fails if it takes longer than
LONG_TIMEOUT seconds.

* Use support.sleeping_retry() and support.busy_retry() ([#93848](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93848))

* Replace time.sleep(0.010) with sleeping_retry() to
  use an exponential sleep.
* support.wait_process(): reuse sleeping_retry().
* _test_eintr: remove unused variables.

* Update includes in call.c ([GH-93786](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93786))

* [gh-93857](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93857): Fix broken audit-event targets in sqlite3 docs ([#93859](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93859))

Corrected targets for the following audit-events:

- sqlite3.enable_load_extension => sqlite3.Connection.enable_load_extension
- sqlite3.load_extension => sqlite3.Connection.load_extension

* [GH-93850](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93850): Fix test_asyncio exception ignored tracebacks ([#93854](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93854))

* test_asyncio: run_until() implements exponential sleep ([#93866](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93866))

run_until() of test.test_asyncio.utils now uses an exponential sleep
delay (max: 1 second), rather than a fixed delay of 1 ms. Similar
design than support.sleeping_retry() wait strategy that applies
exponential backoff.

* test_asyncore: Optimize capture_server() ([#93867](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93867))

Remove time.sleep(0.01) in test_asyncore capture_server(). The sleep
was redundant and inefficient, since the loop starts with
select.select() which also implements a sleep (poll for socket data
with a timeout).

* Tests call sleeping_retry() with SHORT_TIMEOUT ([#93870](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93870))

Tests now call busy_retry() and sleeping_retry() with SHORT_TIMEOUT
or LONG_TIMEOUT (of test.support), rather than hardcoded constants.

Add also WAIT_ACTIVE_CHILDREN_TIMEOUT constant to
_test_multiprocessing.

* [gh-84461](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/84461): Document how to install SDKs manually ([GH-93844](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93844))

* [gh-93820](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93820): Fix copy() regression in enum.Flag ([GH-93876](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93876))

[GH-26658](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/26658) introduced a regression in copy / pickle protocol for combined
`enum.Flag`s. `copy.copy(re.A | re.I)` would fail with
`AttributeError: ASCII|IGNORECASE`.

`enum.Flag` now has a `__reduce_ex__()` method that reduces flags by
combined value, not by combined name.

* Call busy_retry() and sleeping_retry() with error=True ([#93871](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93871))

Tests no longer call busy_retry() and sleeping_retry() with
error=False: raise an exception if the loop times out.

* [gh-87347](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/87347): Add parenthesis around PyXXX_Check() arguments ([#92815](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/92815))

Don't build _testcppext.cpp with -Wzero-as-null-pointer-constant when
testing C++03: only use this compiler flag with C++11.

* [gh-91577](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/91577): SharedMemory move imports out of methods ([#91579](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/91579))

SharedMemory.unlink() uses the unregister() function from resource_tracker. Previously it was imported in the method, but this can fail if the method is called during interpreter shutdown, for example when unlink is part of a __del__() method.

Moving the import to the top of the file, means that the unregister() method is available during interpreter shutdown.

The register call in SharedMemory.__init__() can also use this imported resource_tracker.

regrtest now also implements checking for leaked temporary files and
directories when using -jN for N >= 2. Use tempfile.mkdtemp() to
create the temporary directory. Skip this check on WASI.

* [GH-91389](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/91389): Fix dis position information for CACHEs ([GH-93663](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93663))

test_asyncio, test_logging, test_socket and test_socketserver now
create AF_UNIX domains in the current directory to no longer fail
with OSError("AF_UNIX path too long") if the temporary directory (the
TMPDIR environment variable) is too long.

Modify the following tests to use create_unix_domain_name():

* test_asyncio
* test_logging
* test_socket
* test_socketserver

test_asyncio.utils: remove unused time import.

* [gh-77782](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/77782): Py_FdIsInteractive() now uses PyConfig.interactive ([#93916](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93916))

Set timeout, don't create a local variable with the same name.

* [gh-77782](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/77782): Deprecate global configuration variable ([#93943](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93943))

Deprecate global configuration variable like
Py_IgnoreEnvironmentFlag: the Py_InitializeFromConfig() API should be
instead.

Fix declaration of Py_GETENV(): use PyAPI_FUNC(), not PyAPI_DATA().

Per [@brettcannon](https://github.com/brettcannon) 's [suggestions on the Discourse thread](<https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-594-take-2-removing-dead-batteries-from-the-standard-library/13508/51>), discussed in [#92611](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/92611) and as a followup to PR [#92612](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/92612) , this PR add additional specific per-function replacement information for the utility functions in the `cgi` module deprecated by PEP 594 ([PEP-594](https://peps.python.org/594)).

[@brettcannon](https://github.com/brettcannon) , should this be backported (without the `deprecated-removed` , which I would update it accordingly and re-add in my other PR adding that to the others for 3.11+), or just go in 3.11+?

* Minor optimization for Fractions.limit_denominator ([GH-93730](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/93730))

When we construct the upper and lower candidates in limit_denominator,
the numerator and denominator are already relatively prime (and the
denominator positive) by construction, so there's no need to go through
the usual normalisation in the constructor. This saves a couple of
potentially expensive gcd calls.

### @hamzaavvan **[hamzaavvan](/hamzaavvan)** commented [Mar 13, 2021](#issue-830997167) • edited Loading

Due to no protection against multiple (/) at the beginning of a url an attacker could achieve an open redirection by crafting a malformed URI followed by an existing directory.

Payload: `http://127.0.0.1:8000//attacker.com/..%2f..%2f../anyexistingdirectory`

The main reason behind open redirection is that there's no (/) at the end of `anyexistingdirectory` because the server is checking for the path supplied is a valid directory at `send_head()` method from [Lib/http/server.py](https://github.com/hamzaavvan/cpython/blob/master/Lib/http/server.py#L683). Right after that, it's checking for the path ending with a (/) or not. So, if there's no (/) at the end of the path then the server will issue a Location header to redirect the web client to that specific directory.

While issuing the redirection, this part `//attacker.com/..%2f..%2f../anyexistingdirectory` will be sent to the Location header's value due to which any web client or browser will consider it as a new url because of multiple (/) at the beginning of the path.

So to mitigate this issue I decided to use regex to replace all the occurrences of (/) from the beginning of the path.

```
 self.path = re.sub(r'(^(/|\\)+)', '/', self.path)
```

This regex will replace multiple entries (if present) of (/) or (\) from the beginning of the path. So that the path would be:

1. //attacker.com/..%2f..%2f../anyexistingdirectory **->** /attacker.com/..%2f..%2f../anyexistingdirectory
2. //\attacker.com/..%2f..%2f../anyexistingdirectory **->** /attacker.com/..%2f..%2f../anyexistingdirectory
3. \//\attacker.com/..%2f..%2f../anyexistingdirectory **->** /attacker.com/..%2f..%2f../anyexistingdirectory

And according to these test cases there was no redirection issued from the server after implementing the fix.

<https://bugs.python.org/issue43223>

Sorry, something went wrong.

This doesn't test anything useful. It only checks that some regular expression matches two strings. Since your code change is in `http.server`, your test should execute the `http.server` path that you changed.

A good test should fail without your code change to `http.server`, and pass with your change.

Sorry I've been away due to my workload. But now as I've got some spare time I can do it better. As I've already said earlier that I'm new to writing these test cases and after checking out your comment I'm still confused about your requirements

Can you please elaborate these two statements:

> Since your code change is in http.server, your test should execute the http.server path that you changed.

and this one:

> A good test should fail without your code change to http.server, and pass with your change.

[@hamzaavvan](https://github.com/hamzaavvan), to put it in the simplest terms:

* on a clean checkout of the `main` branch, write a test that fails because it triggers the problem described in [BPO-43223](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=43223); this will prove we have a problem;
* *then* include your fix to prove that the fix solved the problem.

The test will have to actually run the HTTP server to be useful.

Exactly, our team, Python-maint, is the community maintainer of this package. And for us this is a low priority issue, because we'll fix it with a rebase when the fix is released upstream. So we set the Priority to low to indicate that, and to properly categorise it for our triage meetings. Let me try setting it again. Do you see any reason why ProdSec would need to overwrite our setting of the Priority of this BZ?   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2120787#c7)  Sandipan Roy    2022-09-22 04:30:13 UTC  ``` I don't know exactly, but IMO the main bug was marked as moderate so our auto tooling setting priority as moderate.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2120787#c8)  Miro Hrončok    2022-09-29 20:47:51 UTC  ``` I've retired pypy3.7 on F37+.

* Tracker bug: [#1825937](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1825937)
* Release notes tracker: [#494](https://pagure.io/fedora-docs/release-notes/issue/494)

## Detailed Description

The OpenSSL 3.0 release is going to be a significantly new release with changed ABI however with minimal API changes. That means most of the dependent packages will need just a rebuild to work with the new OpenSSL package. However (at least temporarily) a compat-openssl11 package will be provided along the base package so the operation of the Rawhide is not disrupted.

The OpenSSL 3.0 is still in development now but a first beta release should be done in June. After that time the work on the rebase will start and it should be possible to finish it still with a beta releases. Later releases up to the final one should not be disruptive and they should not break API/ABI.

## Benefit to Fedora

This change introduces OpenSSL 3.0 with its significantly reworked internals which allow for better replacement of the crypto implementations via the [Crypto Providers](https://www.openssl.org/docs/OpenSSL300Design.html) concept.

## Scope

* Proposal owners: Provide a compat-openssl11 package, identify dependent packages, provide the rebased openssl package, work with dependent package owners on rebuilds.

* Other developers: Dependent package owners rebuild their packages. Most of the dependencies will not require code changes but for some more fragile dependencies (mostly language bindings) there might be changes needed especially in the test cases which depend on some legacy behavior.

* Release engineering: [Releng issue #9390](https://pagure.io/releng/issue/9390) If compat package is provided a mass rebuild should not be necessary.

* Policies and guidelines: No update of packaging guidelines or other policies should be needed.

* Trademark approval: N/A (not needed for this Change)

## Upgrade/compatibility impact

If compat-openssl11 package is provided there should be no issues with upgrades.

## How To Test

If your application uses OpenSSL to communicate via TLS or perform other tasks that use cryptographic algorithms from OpenSSL, please test whether it continues to work properly. This should be covered by the comprehensive upstream testsuite of OpenSSL. However many dependent packages also provide good test coverage of OpenSSL functionality.

## User Experience

There should be no impact on end-user experience.

## Dependencies

There are many packages which depend on libssl or libcrypto from OpenSSL. Most of them should just work after rebuild with the new openssl package. However it is also not critically needed to rebuild everything at once if compat library compat-openssl11 package is provided.

## Contingency Plan

If the openssl-3.0 is too unstable before the branching point of Fedora 36 we will not update the package and delay the change to Fedora 37.

If the openssl is already updated but it is found out to be too unstable later we can revert to previous version however a rebuild of all dependencies that were already rebuilt will be needed.

* Contingency mechanism: Revert package, rebuild updated dependencies.
* Contingency deadline: Before release
* Blocks release? No
* Blocks product? No

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1834423#c0)  msiddiqu    2020-05-11 16:55:17 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in PyLong_FromString() in Python, which is used by int("text"). For non-binary bases it uses an algorithm with quadratic time complexity to convert a string into an arbitrary precision number. It takes about 50ms to parse an int string with 100,000 digits and about 5sec for 1,000,000 digits. The float type, decimal type, int.from_bytes(), and int() for binary bases 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 are not affected.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1834423#c2)  lnacshon    2020-06-17 10:38:53 UTC  ``` Upstream Python is going to provide fixes for all supported Python versions (3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9-dev).   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1834423#c12)  Sandipan Roy    2022-09-05 05:41:45 UTC  ``` Created mingw-python3 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2124161](show_bug.cgi?id=2124161 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-10735 mingw-python3: python: int() type in PyLong_FromString() does not limit amount of digits converting text to int leading to DoS [fedora-all]")]   Created python34 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 2124160](show_bug.cgi?id=2124160 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2020-10735 python34: python: int() type in PyLong_FromString() does not limit amount of digits converting text to int leading to DoS [epel-7]")]   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1834423#c13)  Sandipan Roy    2022-09-05 05:43:47 UTC  ``` Created python34 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2124162](show_bug.cgi?id=2124162 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2020-10735 python34: python: int() type in PyLong_FromString() does not limit amount of digits converting text to int leading to DoS [fedora-all]")]   Created python35 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2124163](show_bug.cgi?id=2124163 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2020-10735 python35: python: int() type in PyLong_FromString() does not limit amount of digits converting text to int leading to DoS [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1834423#c14)  Miro Hrončok    2022-09-09 12:07:12 UTC  ``` (In reply to Sandipan Roy from [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=1834423#c13)) > Created python34 tracking bugs for this issue: >  > Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2124162](show_bug.cgi?id=2124162 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2020-10735 python34: python: int() type in PyLong_FromString() does not limit amount of digits converting text to int leading to DoS [fedora-all]")] >  >  > Created python35 tracking bugs for this issue: >  > Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2124163](show_bug.cgi?id=2124163 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2020-10735 python35: python: int() type in PyLong_FromString() does not limit amount of digits converting text to int leading to DoS [fedora-all]")]  Both of the packages are retired in Fedora for many releases :/   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1834423#c16)  Fedora Update System    2022-09-13 01:27:35 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2022-4b31e33ed0 has been pushed to the Fedora 36 stable repository.

# Deprecate openssl1.1 package

## Summary

We are going to deprecate openssl1.1 package following the guidelines for deprecated packages:

## Detailed Description

In Fedora 36 we switched to OpenSSL 3.0 branch. This is a brand new version with new architecture. We left the openssl1.1 package for the applications that were unable to switch to the new API/architecture, 3rd-party applications, etc. As openssl 1.1 has a predictable EOL in 2023, we want to ensure that no new products relying on it will appear in Fedora.

## Feedback

## Benefit to Fedora

This proposal ensures than no new packages in Fedora will rely on the deprecated OpenSSL version that will cause an overall increase of security/stability, and will reduce the amount of old packages relying on OpenSSL 1.1 series.

It will also reduce the maintenance burden for the OpenSSL maintainers, especially when new CVEs are published.

## Scope

* Proposal owners:

1. mark package as deprecated
2. provide assistance in migration to other developers

* Other developers:

1. Patch their packages to work with OpenSSL 3.0
2. Python 2.7 maintatiners should consider either migration to 3.0 or removing the tls support.

* Release engineering: [#Releng issue number](https://pagure.io/releng/issues)

This feature doesn't require coordination with release engineering.

* Policies and guidelines: N/A (not needed for this Change)

* Trademark approval: N/A (not needed for this Change)

* Alignment with Objectives:

## Upgrade/compatibility impact

As Crypto Policy support is removed from openssl1.1, applications will need to adjust the configuration files if they contain the line "PROFILE=SYSTEM" according to [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:CryptoPolicies](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging%3ACryptoPolicies)

## How To Test

Regular application tests should catch the regressions caught by these changes.

## User Experience

## Dependencies

As we just mark package as deprecated, no dependency changes happen immediately.

## Contingency Plan

Revert the shipped configuration

* Contingency mechanism: (What to do? Who will do it?) N/A (not a System Wide Change)
* Contingency deadline: N/A (not a System Wide Change)
* Blocks release? N/A (not a System Wide Change), Yes/No

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 37 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [F37Boost178](/wiki/Changes/F37Boost178 "Changes/F37Boost178")
* [F37MingwEnvToolchainUpdate](/wiki/Changes/F37MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/F37MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")
* [Python3.11](/wiki/Changes/Python3.11 "Changes/Python3.11")

## Before the rebuild

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, July 20th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f37
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to the next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to the next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However, maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f37. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f37 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f37
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages are currently built from the source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2020-01-19 15:00:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

### Plans & Pricing

#### What are the differences between the Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Pro is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### How can I upgrade my GitHub Copilot Free license to Copilot Pro?

If you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your [Copilot settings page](https://github.com/settings/copilot) or directly on the [Copilot marketing page](https://github.com/features/copilot).

#### What is included in GitHub Copilot Free?

GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

| ``` The provided version of python distros 3.8.7 and 3.7.4 are vulnerable to open redirection while traversing to an existing directory.  # PAYLOAD [http://127.0.0.1:8000//attacker.com/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f../%0a%0d/../.ssh](http://127.0.0.1:8000//attacker.com/../../../../../../%0A%0D/../.ssh)  In this case, the actual path of .ssh was: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/.ssh>  Upon visiting the payload URI the python server will respond back with a Location header instead of serving the directory contents directly which triggers the redirection to attacker.com  Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 [Python/3.8.7](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/3.8.7) ``` | | | |

| ``` I can only reproduce the issue if the current directory (directory used by the HTTP server, see --directory command line option) contains a .ssh/ subdirectory.  The problem is that the HTTP Header Location starts with "//domain/" and such URL is interpreted as an absolute URL of a new domain name ("domain"), rather than a relative path of the same domain ("localhost").  Maybe we should simply strip all additional leading slashes to only keep one. Replace "//path" or  "/////path" with "/path" for example.  ---  By the way, http.server uses urllib.parse.urlsplit() on the request URL without passing its own domain, and urllib.parse.urlsplit() interprets "//attacker.com/path" as if attacker.com is a host with no scheme:  >>> urllib.parse.urlsplit('//attacker.com/path') SplitResult(scheme='', netloc='attacker.com', path='/path', query='', fragment='')  Maybe parse_qs() should be used instead? Or we should reinject the server domain and port number? I am not sure that it's an issue in practice.  SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.translate_path('//attacker.com/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f../.ssh') returns os.path.join(self.directory, ".ssh"). I don't think that it's an issue, it sounds like the expected behavior. We don't attempt to reject ".." in URL.  ---  To reproduce the issue, I used two terminals.  Terminal 1:  $ python3.8 -V Python 3.8.7 $ python3.8 -m http.server Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (<http://0.0.0.0:8000/>) ... 127.0.0.1 - - [15/Feb/2021 09:18:20] "GET //attacker.com/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f../.ssh HTTP/1.1" 301 -  Terminal 2:  $ wget '[http://127.0.0.1:8000//attacker.com/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f../.ssh](http://127.0.0.1:8000//attacker.com/../../../../../../.ssh)' (...)

(...)  wget is redirected and connects to attacker.com.  The HTTP redirection comes from [Lib/http/server.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/http/server.py):      def send_head(self):         path = self.translate_path(self.path)         f = None         if os.path.isdir(path):             parts = urllib.parse.urlsplit(self.path)             if not parts.path.endswith('/'):                 # redirect browser - doing basically what apache does                 self.send_response(HTTPStatus.MOVED_PERMANENTLY)                 new_parts = (parts[0], parts[1], parts[2] + '/',                              parts[3], parts[4])                 new_url = urllib.parse.urlunsplit(new_parts)                 self.send_header("Location", new_url)                 self.end_headers()                 return None             ...         ...

| ``` As for the directory issue, not only .ssh but an attacker can use any directory to make the open redirection exploitable.  And as for the HTTP Header Location, the server does not remove extra trailing slash from the PAYLOAD uri, which seems to be the cause of vulnerability getting exploited.  [http://127.0.0.1:8000//attacker.com/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f../%0a%0d/../.ssh](http://127.0.0.1:8000//attacker.com/../../../../../../%0A%0D/../.ssh)  So I believe the server should check for multiple slashes and remove them from the path.   Additionally, as you've mentioned it should also prepend the host:port/ to the new_url variable before writing the HTTP Header Location because if an attacker bypasses the protection and add an extra slash the server will still redirect to the host which is getting inserted into the Location header. But honestly I need your opinion as concatenating host to the url may lead to Host Header Injection but it'll then require a different context.  Please watch the POC video.
