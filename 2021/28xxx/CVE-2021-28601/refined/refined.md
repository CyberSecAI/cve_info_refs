- **Root cause of vulnerability**: NULL Pointer Dereference
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference, which occurs when the program attempts to access memory using a null pointer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation leads to an application denial-of-service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited locally with user interaction required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the system and must convince the user to perform a specific action.
