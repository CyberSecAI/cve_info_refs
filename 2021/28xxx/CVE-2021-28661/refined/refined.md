  "CVE-2021-28661": {
    "description": "CMS users without limited permissions to view data may be able access privileged information via the /admin/graphql endpoint because of a missing canView() on data. This affects data classes that utilise or inherit from the Read or ReadOne GraphQL 3 classes that don't explicitly assign a service class to the permissionChecker property of their implementation. On a default installation this will expose limited (ID, FirstName, Surname) information from the Member table which a CMS user typically will not have access to.",
    "root_cause": "Missing canView() check on data access via GraphQL.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Inadequate access control",
      "Information exposure"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthorized access to sensitive data (e.g., user details like ID, first name, and surname).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Accessing the /admin/graphql endpoint"
    ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "A CMS user with limited view permissions can exploit this vulnerability."
