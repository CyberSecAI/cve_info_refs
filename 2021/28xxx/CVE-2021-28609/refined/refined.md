- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when a program attempts to access memory outside the boundaries of an allocated buffer or data structure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact is an arbitrary file system read, which could allow an attacker to access sensitive data on the file system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction in the form of opening a crafted file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the user open a specially crafted file using vulnerable versions of Adobe After Effects.
