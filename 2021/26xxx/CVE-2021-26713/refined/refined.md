Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26713:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a signedness comparison mismatch within the `res_rtp_asterisk.c` module. This mismatch leads to an integer overflow when processing multiple hold/unhold requests from a WebRTC client in quick succession.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Signedness Mismatch:** A comparison involving a signed integer and an unsigned integer was performed incorrectly, which could cause an integer overflow.
*   **Stack Overflow:** The integer overflow leads to a stack overflow, a type of buffer overflow that overwrites data on the call stack, causing a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit results in a crash of the Asterisk server. This constitutes a denial-of-service vulnerability, disrupting the server's ability to provide communication services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **WebRTC Client:** The attack vector is a remote, authenticated WebRTC client.
*   **Hold/Unhold Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending multiple hold/unhold requests to the Asterisk server in rapid succession.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated WebRTC Client:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated WebRTC client connected to the Asterisk server.
*   **Ability to Send Rapid Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send multiple hold/unhold requests to the server quickly.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was reported on December 9, 2020, by Edvin Vidmar and was resolved in later versions of Asterisk.
*   The fix involves correcting the packet size comparison terms, resolving the signedness mismatch.
*   The vulnerability is considered moderate severity.
*   The issue was introduced in Asterisk versions: 16.x before 16.16.0, 17.x before 17.9.1, 18.x before 18.2.0, and Certified Asterisk 16.x before 16.8-cert5.
*   The issue was corrected in Asterisk versions: 16.16.1, 17.9.2, 18.2.1, and Certified Asterisk 16.8-cert6.
*   Patches are available at the provided URLs for the affected versions.
