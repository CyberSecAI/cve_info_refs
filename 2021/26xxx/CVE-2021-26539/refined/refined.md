Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26539:

**Verification:**
The provided content relates to a fix for an IDNA (Internationalized Domain Name) attack on the iframe hostname validator in the `sanitize-html` library, which is addressed by pull request #458 and the associated commit `bdf7836`. This aligns with the description of CVE-2021-26539 which mentions an IDNA vulnerability within the `sanitize-html` library.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of Internationalized Domain Names (IDNA) when validating iframe `src` attributes. Specifically, the library was not using a proper parser for URLs leading to bypasses using specially crafted domain names.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The `sanitize-html` library was vulnerable to IDNA attacks, which could allow an attacker to bypass the intended restrictions on iframe sources by crafting a domain name that looks like an allowed domain, but is actually a different one due to Unicode encoding.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** By bypassing the iframe hostname validation, an attacker could potentially inject iframes with arbitrary content, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or other malicious activity within the context of the application using `sanitize-html`.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTML string containing an iframe tag with a `src` attribute that uses a specially crafted IDNA domain. This HTML is then passed to the `sanitize-html` library for processing.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to control or influence the HTML input that is processed by the `sanitize-html` library. This could be done by injecting malicious HTML into a field that is then processed by the library.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involved using the WHATWG URL parser for validating iframe hostnames, which correctly handles IDNA.
*   The pull request #458 specifically addresses the "stop idna iframe attacks".
*   The vulnerability was reported by Ron Masas of Checkmarx.
*   The `CHANGELOG.md` entry for version 2.3.1 explicitly mentions the fix for the IDNA attack.

**Summary of extracted information:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2021-26539
*   **Root cause:** Improper handling of IDNA when validating iframe src attributes.
*   **Vulnerability:** IDNA attack bypass allowing malicious iframes.
*   **Impact:** XSS, malicious activity via injected iframes.
*   **Attack vector:** Malicious HTML with crafted IDNA iframe src URLs.
*   **Attacker position:** Ability to influence HTML input processed by `sanitize-html`.
*   **Fix:** Using WHATWG URL parser for iframe hostname validation.
