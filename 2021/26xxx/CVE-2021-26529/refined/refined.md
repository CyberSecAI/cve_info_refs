- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect error handling of the `calloc` function in `mg_tls_init`. When `calloc` fails to allocate memory, it returns a NULL pointer, but this is not checked, leading to a dereference of a NULL pointer and out-of-bounds write attempt.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Out-of-bounds write due to missing NULL pointer check.
  - Potential overwrite of near NULL pointer addresses in environments with limited memory.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - Segmentation fault errors leading to denial of service
  - Potential overwrite of device configuration in embedded systems with limited memory (especially if device configuration is stored near address 0x458).
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attack via HTTPS connection requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTPS requests to the vulnerable server.
  - The attacker needs to be able to cause memory exhaustion via flooding requests.
