### **[cve-reporting](/cve-reporting)** commented [Jan 23, 2021](#issue-792617302)

| Mongoose HTTPS server (compiled with mbedTLS support) is vulnerable to remote OOB write attack via connection request after exhausting memory pool.  Incorrect handling of the value returned by calloc in mg\_tls\_init may lead to:   * out-of-bound write attempt and segmentation fault error in case of restrictive memory protection, * near NULL pointer (at 0x458) overwrite in case of limited memory restrictions (e.g. in embedded environments).   Memory allocations are triggered during handling of each HTTPS requests, so the allocation error can be caused remotely by flooding with requests until exhausting the memory. In some embedded environments near zero memory areas are used to store device configuration, so in this case such configuration can be overwritten remotely.  Vulnerable code (mongoose.c):  ``` 3255: struct mg_tls { 3256:   char *cafile;             // CA certificate path 3257:   mbedtls_x509_crt ca;      // Parsed CA certificate 3258:   mbedtls_x509_crt cert;    // Parsed certificate 3259:   mbedtls_ssl_context ssl;  // SSL/TLS context 3260:   mbedtls_ssl_config conf;  // SSL-TLS config 3261:   mbedtls_pk_context pk;    // Private key context 3262: };  3296: int mg_tls_init(struct mg_connection *c, struct mg_tls_opts *opts) { 3297:   struct mg_tls *tls = (struct mg_tls *) calloc(1, sizeof(*tls)); printf("mg_tls_init tls = %p %ld\n", tls, &(tls->ssl)); 3298:   int rc = 0; 3299:   LOG(LL_DEBUG, ("%lu Setting TLS, CA: %s, cert: %s, key: %s", c->id, 3300:                 opts->ca == NULL ? "null" : opts->ca, 3301:                  opts->cert == NULL ? "null" : opts->cert, 3302:                  opts->certkey == NULL ? "null" : opts->certkey)); 3303:   mbedtls_ssl_init(&tls->ssl); 3304:   mbedtls_ssl_config_init(&tls->conf); 3305:   mbedtls_ssl_conf_dbg(&tls->conf, debug_cb, c);  ```  See following recommendations for details (especially the calloc example): [https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/ERR33-C.+Detect+and+handle+standard+library+errors](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/ERR33-C.%2BDetect%2Band%2Bhandle%2Bstandard%2Blibrary%2Berrors)  The issue can be reproduced and tested using ErrorSanitizer (<https://gitlab.com/ErrorSanitizer/ErrorSanitizer>).  Reproduction steps:   0. Install gdb 1. Download and unpack code of ErrorSanitizer (<https://gitlab.com/ErrorSanitizer/ErrorSanitizer>) 2. Perform compilation of ErrorSanitizer according to the manual (<https://gitlab.com/ErrorSanitizer/ErrorSanitizer#compilation>)  cd ErrorSanitizer; make 3. Set ESAN to the path of ErrorSanitizer directory  export ESAN=/opt/... 4. Download and unzip attached map temp\_2.cur\_input    [temp\_2.cur\_input.zip](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose/files/5860691/temp_2.cur_input.zip) 5. Install mbedTLS library 6. Download, unzip and compile mongoose example "http-restful-server" with define MBEDTLS\_DIR set for mbedTLS directory and debug symbols (-g) 7. Run Mongoose "http-restful-server" example with ErrorSanitizer in gdb using:  gdb -batch -ex='run' -ex='backtrace' --args env LD\_PRELOAD="$ESAN/error\_sanitizer\_preload.so" ./example temp\_2.cur\_input 8. Open in the browser following URL (where <MONGOOSE\_ADDR> is address of tested Mongoose instance):  https://<MONGOOSE\_ADDR>:8000   You should receive similar output:  ``` process 30197 is executing new program: mongoose/examples/http-restful-server/example 2021-01-21 00:00:00  I log.c:18:mg_log_set       Setting log level to 2 2021-01-21 00:00:00  I sock.c:453:mg_listen      1 accepting on https://localhost:8000  Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. 0x00007ffff79970d0 in mbedtls_ssl_init () from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmbedtls.so.10 #0  0x00007ffff79970d0 in mbedtls_ssl_init () from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmbedtls.so.10 #1  0x0000555555560fa9 in mg_tls_init (c=0x5555557688c0, opts=0x7fffffffdbf0) at src/tls.c:70 #2  0x000055555556377a in fn (c=0x5555557688c0, ev=4, ev_data=0x0, fn_data=0x0) at main.c:28 #3  0x0000555555557df1 in mg_call (c=0x5555557688c0, ev=4, ev_data=0x0) at src/event.c:9 #4  0x000055555555fae4 in accept_conn (mgr=0x7fffffffdd20, lsn=0x5555557686c0) at src/sock.c:393 #5  0x0000555555560484 in mg_mgr_poll (mgr=0x7fffffffdd20, ms=1000) at src/sock.c:543 #6  0x00005555555638de in main () at main.c:51  ``` |
