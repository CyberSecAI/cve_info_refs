Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2021-26752:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. Specifically, the `md` and `ag` parameters within the `/Nodes-Traffic.php` endpoint are not sanitized, allowing for the injection of OS commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The application does not sanitize user-supplied input (`md` and `ag` parameters) before using it in an `exec()` function, allowing execution of arbitrary operating system commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on the server where the NeDi application is installed.
- **System Compromise:**  Successful exploitation allows complete compromise of the target operating system and access to all application data. This could lead to data exfiltration, further attacks, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameters:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting malicious requests to `/Nodes-Traffic.php` with specific values in the `md` and `ag` HTTP GET parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid credentials to access the NeDi web interface.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable NeDi server.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker must have identified the vulnerable parameters `md` and `ag` via source code analysis

**Technical Details:**
- The code at `/var/nedi/html/Nodes-Traffic.php` uses `exec()` functions, particularly at line 517.
- The `$am` variable, which controls whether the vulnerable `exec` function is triggered, is set to `1` when the `$md` variable is equal to `S`.
- The value of the `md` parameter from the URL is directly assigned to the `$md` variable on line 23, without any sanitization.
- The `ag` parameter is also directly used in the command without sanitization

The vulnerability is triggered by a request like:
`https://hostname/Nodes-Traffic.php?md=S&ag=%3b<command>%3b` where `<command>` can be any OS command.
