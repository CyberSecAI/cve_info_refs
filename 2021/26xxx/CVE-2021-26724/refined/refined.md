- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command, leading to OS command injection. Specifically, this occurs when changing date settings or hostname in the Guardian/CMC management interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS Command Injection (CWE-78). The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when setting the date or hostname.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated web GUI administrator can execute arbitrary OS commands on the local system and escalate privileges to root.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is accessible through the management interface (web GUI) when changing date settings or hostname.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator on the web GUI.
