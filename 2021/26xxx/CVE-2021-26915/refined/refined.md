The provided content describes multiple deserialization vulnerabilities in NetMotion Mobility Server, including CVE-2021-26915.

**Root Cause:** The root cause for all the vulnerabilities is the unsafe deserialization of untrusted data. The NetMotion Mobility Server uses `ObjectInputStream.readObject()` on attacker-controlled data without proper validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized, can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unsafe deserialization of user-supplied data in several servlets:
  - `com.nmwco.server.support.SupportRpcServlet`
  - `com.nmwco.server.events.EventRpcServlet`
  - `com.nmwco.server.mvc.MvcServlet`
  - `com.nmwco.server.webrepdb.StatusServlet`
- Lack of input validation on serialized data.
- Use of `readObject` on attacker-controlled streams.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) with SYSTEM privileges.
- The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Full compromise of the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending POST requests with malicious serialized Java objects to the vulnerable servlets.
- Crafting a URL with a `Mvc_x_Form_x_Name` parameter containing a base64-encoded, gzipped malicious serialized Java object.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected NetMotion Mobility Server.
- No authentication is required for exploiting these vulnerabilities.
- Ability to craft serialized Java objects using tools like `ysoserial`.
- Network access to the server is required.
