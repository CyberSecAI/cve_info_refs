Recommendation for End of Support /End of Life Products

From time to time, D-Link will decide that some of its products have reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life (“EOL”). D-Link may choose to EOS/EOL a product due to evolution of technology, market demands,  new innovations, product efficiencies based on new technologies, or the product matures over time and should be replaced by functionally superior technology.

**For US Consumer**

If a product has reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life ("EOL"), there is normally no further extended support or development for it.

Typically for these products, D-Link will be unable to resolve device or firmware issues since all development and customer support has ceased.

D-Link strongly recommends that this product be retired and cautions that any further use of this product may be a risk to devices connected to it. If US consumers continue to use these devices against D-Link's recommendation, please make sure the device has the most recent firmware, make sure you frequently update the device's unique password to access its web-configuration, and always have WIFI encryption enabled with a unique password.

======== < 0. Overview > ===============================================

Release Date: 7 March 2021

Revision: 1.0

Impact:

The ADSL modem DSL-320B-D1, version EU_1.25 and lower, is affected to
multiple Stack Buffer Overflows that allow unauthenticated remote
attackers to takeover the device.

Severity: Critical

CVSS Score: 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

CVE-ID: CVE-2021-26709

Vendor: D-Link

Affected Products: DSL-320B-D1

Affected Versions: EU_1.25 and lower

======== < 1. Details > ================================================

During a Penetration Test it was possible to identify and exploit
multiple Stack Buffer Overflows (1) in the D-Link DSL-320B-D1 ADSL modem
,a now legacy model, which is distributed in the past by Telecom Italia
on loan for use together with the residential ADSL line.

The vulnerabilities are present in the login functionality, exposed by
"login.xgi" with "user" and "pass" parameters.

[[
GET /login.xgi?user=" + payload + "&pass=abcde HTTP/1.1\nHost: " +
host + "\n\n"
]]

To exploit the vulnerability using "user" parameter, you need
construct the payload like the following:

[[
OFFSET = 652
ADDR = 0x7ffe8ab0

payload = "A"*OFFSET
payload += pack(">I", ADDR)
payload += shellcode
]]

While the "pass" parameter uses 641 as offset.

The payload must be passed as parameter value in a GET request.

You can found a working shellcode here:
<https://www.exploit-db.com/shellcodes/45541>

You will have to change the ip/port to match your network configuration.

Using ROP is possible to avoid to use the hardcoded addresses.
