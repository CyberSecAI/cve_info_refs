Subject: Remote code execution in connman

Hi,

Tesla has reported a remote (adjacent network) code execution flaw in
connman, a lightweight network manager, to our SUSE colleage and
connman upstream maintainer Daniel Wagner,

<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/connman/connman.git/>

<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/connman/connman.git/commit/?id=e4079a20f617a4b076af503f6e4e8b0304c9f2cb>

Mitre has assigned CVE-2021-26675.

The commit fixes a stack buffer overflow that can be used to execute code by network adjacent attackers.

<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/connman/connman.git/commit/?id=a74524b3e3fad81b0fd1084ffdf9f2ea469cd9b1>
<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/connman/connman.git/commit/?id=58d397ba74873384aee449690a9070bacd5676fa>

Mitre has assigned CVE-2021-26676

Remote stack information leak which can be used to help execute CVE-2021-26675 reliably.

Ciao, Marcus

Package        : connman
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-26675 CVE-2021-26676

A remote information leak vulnerability and a remote buffer overflow
vulnerability were discovered in ConnMan, a network manager for embedded
devices, which could result in denial of service or the execution of
arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.36-2.1~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your connman packages.

For the detailed security status of connman please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/connman>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
