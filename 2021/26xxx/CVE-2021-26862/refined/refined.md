Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26862:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the Windows Installer Service. By creating a directory junction, an attacker can manipulate the service to create an arbitrary file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is an improper handling of directory junctions by the Windows Installer Service, allowing for arbitrary file creation. This could be due to insufficient validation of paths or a lack of proper access control when handling directory junctions during installation processes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate privileges from a low-privileged context to SYSTEM, enabling the execution of arbitrary code with administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target system (with low privileges). The specific mechanism involves creating a directory junction and leveraging it to create arbitrary files through the vulnerable Windows Installer Service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker must be able to execute low-privileged code on the target Windows system to create a directory junction and then trigger the vulnerable Windows Installer Service.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a privilege escalation flaw in the Windows Installer Service, where by creating a directory junction, an attacker can cause the service to create arbitrary files and thereby gain SYSTEM level access and execute arbitrary code. This requires local access with the ability to execute low-privileged code.
