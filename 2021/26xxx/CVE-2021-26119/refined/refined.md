Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-26119:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the ability to access `$smarty.template_object` even when Smarty is running in sandbox mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Sandbox Escape:** The primary issue is a sandbox escape. In a sandboxed environment, certain features or variables are intended to be restricted to prevent malicious code from interacting with the underlying system or accessing sensitive data. The ability to access `$smarty.template_object` allows an attacker to bypass these restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The provided information does not specify the exact actions that can be performed upon accessing `$smarty.template_object`. However, a sandbox escape generally allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to internal Smarty objects/methods, which can potentially lead to various impacts such as:
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Ability to access sensitive information or internal data.
    *   **Code Execution:** Possibility to execute arbitrary PHP code. The content mentions other CVEs related to code injection, which indicates a likely scenario

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a Smarty template. An attacker controlling the Smarty template can exploit this vulnerability by directly accessing `$smarty.template_object` within the template code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to control the Smarty template content. This could mean:
    *   Directly writing the template file.
    *   Injecting malicious code into a template via an upload mechanism or another vulnerability that can manipulate the source code of a template used by the application.
    *   Manipulating the data used by the application to populate variables within the template.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content indicates that this vulnerability has been fixed in Smarty version 3.1.39.
* It's important to note that the information provided by Debian states this CVE is related to "sandbox escape", while the CVE description is missing or a placeholder.
