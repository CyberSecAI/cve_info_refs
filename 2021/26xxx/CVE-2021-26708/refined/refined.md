Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26708:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content explicitly mentions CVE-2021-26708 as a vulnerability found in the Linux kernel's AF_VSOCK implementation, which is also used in multiple NetApp products. The vulnerability description aligns with the information in the provided resources.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   The vulnerability is a race condition stemming from improper locking within the `net/vmw_vsock/af_vsock.c` file in the Linux kernel.
    *   The race conditions were introduced with the addition of multi-transport support for VSOCK in November 2019. Specifically, commits `c0cfa2d8a788fcf4` and `6a2c0962105ae8ce` introduced the flaw by copying the `vsock_sock.transport` pointer before acquiring the socket lock, which could lead to a stale pointer being used after the lock is obtained.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Race Condition:** Multiple threads accessing and modifying the `vsock_sock.transport` pointer concurrently, without proper synchronization.
    *   **Use-After-Free:** When a transport is deallocated by one thread while another thread is still using a stale pointer to access it.
    *   **Improper Locking:** The copying of the transport pointer before acquiring the lock allows other threads to modify the pointer before it's used.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  Sensitive data within kernel memory can be exposed.
    *   **Data Modification:** An attacker can add or modify data by overwriting kernel memory using the stale transport pointer.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting the race condition can lead to a system crash.
    *   **Local Privilege Escalation (LPE):** As demonstrated in the provided exploit write-up, this vulnerability could lead to an unprivileged user escalating to root privileges. Specifically, the vulnerability allows a controlled 4 byte write to a freed object which then can be turned into an arbitrary read/write.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered by creating and using an `AF_VSOCK` socket.
    *   The race condition is achieved by initiating a `setsockopt()` call on one thread while another thread changes the socket transport via a `connect()` call with different addresses, causing the first thread to use a stale pointer.
    *   Privilege escalation is achieved via memory corruption leading to arbitrary code execution.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to a system running a vulnerable Linux kernel.
    *   **Unprivileged User:** The vulnerability is exploitable by an unprivileged user, especially when user namespaces are not required for `AF_VSOCK` socket creation.
    *   **Ability to Create Sockets:** The attacker needs to be able to create sockets of the `AF_VSOCK` family.

*  **Additional Technical Details:**
    *  The affected kernel versions are those prior to 5.10.13.
    * The exploit was successfully demonstrated on Fedora 33 Server (x86_64), bypassing SMEP and SMAP.
    *  The exploit leverages the `msgsnd()` syscall and heap spraying to overwrite the `msg_msg` structure. The vulnerability is triggered by the out-of-bounds write within the `virtio_transport_notify_buffer_size()` function.
   * By using `msgrcv()` with the `MSG_COPY` flag, the attacker can get a copy of a corrupted `msg_msg` structure to perform a kernel memory leak.
   * After performing the kernel leak, a use-after-free is then triggered in order to perform an arbitrary write to `skb_shared_info`, which will allow hijacking program execution, leading to privilege escalation.

**3. Additional Notes:**

*   The NetApp advisory indicates that several products are affected, but some are marked as "Won't Fix" due to End-of-Availability (EOA).
*   NetApp provides software fixes for some affected products.
*   The mailing list content shows the initial disclosure of the vulnerability and the corresponding patch that was merged into the mainline kernel.
*  The exploit writeup provides a detailed account of how the race condition was exploited, along with the techniques used to bypass security features such as SMEP and SMAP, and to achieve privilege escalation.
* The "Openwall" content shows the discussion on the oss-security mailing list regarding the vulnerability and the decision to make a public disclosure after the fix was merged in the mainline kernel.

In summary, CVE-2021-26708 is a complex race condition vulnerability in the Linux kernel with significant security implications, leading to potential information disclosure, data modification, denial of service, and privilege escalation on affected systems.
