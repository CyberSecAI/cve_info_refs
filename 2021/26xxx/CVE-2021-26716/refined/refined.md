The provided content is related to CVE-2021-26716.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `emoncms/Modules/input/Views/schedule.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS through the `node` parameter in the `schedule.php` view.
- The `node` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session, which could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing user cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the application
    - Other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `schedule.php` with a malicious JavaScript payload in the `node` parameter.
- The attacker can provide a URL like `http://127.0.0.1:9000/Modules/input/Views/schedule.php?node=1%22;alert(1);var%20x=%22l` to trigger the XSS vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to craft a URL containing the malicious script.
- The attacker needs to be able to get the victim to access the crafted URL.
- No special privileges or user authentication is mentioned as a requirement.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was resolved by removing the unused code containing the vulnerable parameter `node`.
