| Hello [@soulfoodisgood](https://github.com/soulfoodisgood), First of all, thank you for your report. I'm trying to define the relevance of this issue. Executing HTML/JS in the viewer it's originally a developer feature. It is the owner's responsibility to check the content of these notes. I could probably prevent javascript execution without affecting HTML functionality and/or add a flag to manually allow javascript to run in files. Thanks |

| Please check <https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/remote-code-execution-through-cross-site-scripting-in-electron-f3b891ad637> XSS is dangerous for electron apps because once `nodeIntegration` set as true or it can be bypassed to get "require" available, it leads to remote code execution . |
