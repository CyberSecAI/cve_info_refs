The content discusses a stored XSS vulnerability in the `znote-app`.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application allows execution of HTML/JS in the note viewer, which was originally intended as a developer feature. This lack of sanitization or restriction on user-supplied HTML/JS inputs leads to the XSS vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application does not properly sanitize user-provided content before rendering it in the note viewer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers who view the malicious note, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Electron applications if `nodeIntegration` is enabled or bypassed, as noted in the linked medium article.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious HTML/JavaScript payloads within the note content. The user provided example payloads include: `<svg> <svg onload=alert(1)>` and `<iframe src=x onload=alert(1)>`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker can inject the malicious code into a note, likely through a user interface element or data store accessible to the attacker. Once saved, any user who views this note will be exposed to the injected code.
