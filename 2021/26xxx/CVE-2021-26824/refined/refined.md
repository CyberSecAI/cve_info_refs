{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that the authentication result (password validity) is transmitted to the management program (Fingertool) after the password comparison within the Authentication Module (hardware). This allows an attacker to capture a valid authentication response and replay it later, even with an incorrect password.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Replay attack vulnerability due to reliance on transmitted authentication results rather than secure session management",
      "Lack of proper authentication result validation and replay prevention mechanisms"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass authentication, delete users, add malicious users, and steal encrypted data even without the password.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access is required to intercept and replay the authentication result using the DeviceIoControl function.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have low privileges on the local machine and the ability to capture and replay the output of the DeviceIoControl function calls related to authentication."
  },
  "additional_information": {
    "affected_product": "Biometric fingerprint recognition USB3.0 memory (PD065) with Fingertool software",
    "affected_version": "1.19",
     "patched_versions": "Not patched",
    "workarounds": "Code Obfuscation, Code Encryption, Digital Watermarking"
