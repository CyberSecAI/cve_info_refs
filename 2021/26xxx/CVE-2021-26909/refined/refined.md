Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-26909:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an easily guessable endpoint in the Automox AWS infrastructure. The endpoint follows a predictable pattern: `hxxps://automox-policy-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/<6 digit policy ID>/filename.extension`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Predictable Resource Location:** The use of sequential 6-digit policy IDs in the URL makes it trivial to enumerate valid resources.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The vulnerability allows access to resources (policy files) based on a predictable naming scheme.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can download sensitive internal files, potentially including information proving that an endpoint is trusted within a security program.
- **Potential Impersonation:** This could allow an attacker to misuse the resources to impersonate a trusted endpoint and gain unauthorized access or privileges.
- **Exposure of Endpoint Security Solutions:** An attacker could discover which security solutions are deployed for a specific site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based Attack:** The attack involves sending an HTTP request to the predictable URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have access to the Automox system.
- **Knowledge of URL Pattern:** The attacker must know the basic URL structure to make educated guesses for policy IDs.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs access to the internet to make the HTTP request.
