  "ID": "CVE-2021-26296",
  "Summary": "Multiple NetApp products incorporate Apache MyFaces. Apache MyFaces versions 2.2.0 through 2.2.13, 2.3.0 through 2.3.7, 2.3-next-M1 through 2.3-next-M4, and 3.0.0-RC1 are susceptible to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the insecure generation of CSRF tokens using `java.util.Random` which is a weak random number generator. This allows an attacker to predict CSRF tokens and bypass CSRF protection mechanisms.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Use of an insecure random number generator (`java.util.Random`) for generating CSRF tokens, making them predictable.",
    "Insufficient CSRF protection as the ViewState parameter is generated using an insecure random number generator",
    "The initial value of the per-session sequence counter for ViewState parameter is 1, making it easily guessable."
  ],
  "Impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or a Denial of Service (DoS). Specifically, an attacker can perform Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by predicting ViewState parameters and CSRF tokens.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Luring an authenticated user to an attacker-controlled website.",
    "Requesting a ViewState value from the application to generate/predict other ViewState values",
    "Sending multiple CSRF requests with combinations of predicted random strings and sequence numbers to exploit CSRF vulnerability.",
     "Bypassing CSRF protection mechanisms"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to lure an authenticated victim to an attacker-controlled website.  The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests.",
  "Affected Products": [
    "OnCommand Insight"
  ],
    "Remediation": "Upgrade to Apache MyFaces version 2.2.14, 2.3.8, 2.3-next-M5 or 3.0.0, or configure the properties `org.apache.myfaces.RANDOM_KEY_IN_VIEW_STATE_SESSION_TOKEN`, `org.apache.myfaces.RANDOM_KEY_IN_CSRF_SESSION_TOKEN`, and `org.apache.myfaces.RANDOM_KEY_IN_WEBSOCKET_SESSION_TOKEN` to 'secureRandom'."
