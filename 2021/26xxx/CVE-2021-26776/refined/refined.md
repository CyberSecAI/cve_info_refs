Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26776:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in multiple fields across different functionalities within the CSZ CMS 1.2.9. Specifically, the `name` fields in various modules such as Forms Builder, XML Plugin Widgets, Statistic for link, Banner Manager, Carousel Widget, Pages Content, Language, and Plugin Manager are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is susceptible to stored XSS. Malicious scripts can be injected into the vulnerable fields and are then stored persistently on the server. When a user accesses the affected page or functionality, the malicious script is executed in their browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser.
- **Account Takeover:**  Attackers could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, leading to account hijacking.
- **Data Manipulation:** Malicious scripts can modify the content or behavior of the web application.
- **Phishing:** An attacker can redirect users to a malicious website or impersonate legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attacker injects malicious code (JavaScript) within specific `name` fields of different modules of CSZ CMS through the administrative interface.
- The injected scripts are stored in the database, and whenever a page or functionality that displays this data is accessed, the scripts are executed by the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Administrative Access:** An attacker needs to have an editor account with sufficient privileges to access the vulnerable modules. These include Forms Builder, XML Plugin Widgets, Statistic for link, Banner Manager, Carousel Widget, Pages Content, Language, and Plugin Manager.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Fields:**  The attacker needs to know which fields are vulnerable to XSS.

**Technical Details:**

The provided PoC payloads use the following technique:

-   `<noframes><p title="</noframes><svg/onload=alert(document.domain)>">` or `<noframes><p title="</noframes><svg/onload=alert('xss')>">`
    - This payload attempts to inject an SVG `onload` event that triggers a javascript alert showing the domain name or 'xss' in the title attribute of a p tag inside a `noframes` element.
    - The `noframes` element is used to bypass some filters, likely by making the injection less obvious.
    - The `svg` element with `onload` event is used to execute arbitrary Javascript code once the element is rendered in the browser.

The vulnerability was reported on February 2nd, 2021, and was assigned CVE-2021-26776, and later fixed in a subsequent version of the software, though the exact version is not specified.
