Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26948:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the `copy_image` function of `epub.cxx`. This occurs because the arguments of the `compare_images` function, which is called within `copy_image`, are not properly checked before being used by `strcmp()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is that `strcmp` can be called with a null pointer argument, resulting in a segmentation fault (SEGV).
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code lacks proper input validation, specifically within the `compare_images` function and subsequently in `copy_image`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability will cause the `htmldoc` application to crash (segmentation fault), resulting in a denial of service.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The advisory mentions that arbitrary code execution could be possible although the provided details do not elaborate on that.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted HTML File:** The attacker provides a specially crafted HTML file to the `htmldoc` application as input. The provided `crash01.html.zip` file shows the use of a data URI to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Command-Line Input:** The `htmldoc` command line utility is used to convert the HTML file to an EPUB format, triggering the vulnerable code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide an input HTML file to the `htmldoc` application.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when the user executes the `htmldoc` command line tool. This is confirmed by the CVSS metric `UI:R`.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found while fuzzing the `htmldoc` application.
- The vulnerable code exists in the `epub.cxx` file, specifically within the `copy_image` function.
- The specific line where the issue occurs is line 1221 in `epub.cxx`.
- The issue is triggered when a data URI is processed as an image source which leads to passing NULL arguments to `compare_images` resulting in `strcmp` dereferencing a NULL pointer.
- The issue was fixed by commit `008861d`.
- The CVE is rated as High Severity with a CVSS score of 7.8. The CVSS vector is `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`.
- The vulnerability has a CWE of CWE-476, which is "NULL Pointer Dereference".

The provided information indicates a clear vulnerability involving a null pointer dereference due to a lack of input validation that can lead to DoS and potential arbitrary code execution when processing a crafted HTML file.
