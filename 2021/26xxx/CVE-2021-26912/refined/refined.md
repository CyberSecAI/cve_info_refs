The provided content describes multiple deserialization vulnerabilities in NetMotion Mobility Server. This content relates to CVE-2021-26912 as it is mentioned in the advisory.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerabilities is the unsafe deserialization of untrusted data in multiple servlets within the NetMotion Mobility Server. The server uses `ObjectInputStream.readObject()` on attacker-controlled data without proper validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The identified weaknesses are:
1.  **Unsafe Deserialization:** The server deserializes data from the request stream without verifying its integrity, allowing attackers to inject malicious serialized objects.
2.  **Multiple Vulnerable Endpoints:**  Several servlets (`SupportRpcServlet`, `EventRpcServlet`, `MvcServlet`, and `StatusServlet`) are vulnerable, each presenting a different attack vector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with SYSTEM privileges. This can lead to complete compromise of the server, including data theft, data manipulation, denial of service, and further network compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vectors vary slightly depending on the specific servlet:
1.  **`SupportRpcServlet`:**  Send a POST request with a serialized Java object in the request body to `/SupportRpcServlet`.
2.  **`EventRpcServlet`:** Send a POST request with a serialized Java object in the request body to `/EventRpcServlet`.
3.  **`MvcServlet`:**  Send a GET or POST request to `/mobility/Menu/isLoggedOn` with the `Mvc_x_Form_x_Name` parameter containing a base64-encoded, gzipped serialized Java object.
4.  **`StatusServlet`:** Send a POST request with a serialized Java object in the request body to `/WebRepDb/status`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the NetMotion Mobility Server web interface. The advisory mentions that servers exposed to untrusted networks are particularly vulnerable.
2.  **Payload Generation:** The attacker needs to generate a malicious serialized Java object (e.g. using `ysoserial`) that will execute arbitrary code on the server when deserialized.
3.  **Request Sending:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests (POST/GET) to the vulnerable endpoints.

The advisory provides significantly more detail than a basic CVE description, including code snippets, specific vulnerable classes and methods, and proof-of-concept exploit examples for each vulnerable servlet. It also details the affected versions and vendor response.
