- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path by the Windows Installer service before using it in file operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper input validation, specifically related to user-supplied file paths. This allows for an arbitrary file write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of an administrator.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attackers, who have already achieved low-privileged code execution, can leverage this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. The user interface interaction is required (UI:R), which means some user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability
