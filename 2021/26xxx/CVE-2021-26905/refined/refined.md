Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26905:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The 1Password SCIM bridge did not properly validate input received on the authenticated endpoint used to fetch log files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The primary weakness was the lack of proper validation of input parameters when requesting log files, which allowed an attacker to manipulate the request to access the Redis cache.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could use the vulnerability to read data from the application's Redis cache, potentially exposing internal deployment details of the SCIM bridge.
- **Potential Exposure of Other Applications:** If the Redis cache was shared between the SCIM bridge and other applications, information from those applications could also be exposed.
- **No Direct Risk to Password Data:** The vulnerability did not directly put password data at risk.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Authenticated Access to SCIM Bridge:** The attacker needs to be able to authenticate to the SCIM bridge using a valid authorization token.
- **Manipulation of Logging Endpoint:** The attacker needs to craft a specific request to the logging endpoint to exploit the input validation vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker would need to have a valid authorization token for the SCIM bridge, implying they have compromised privileged access to the application.
- They would need to be able to make HTTP requests to the SCIM bridge's logging endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**

- The original advisory initially mentioned the potential exposure of TLS certificates and private keys but was later corrected. It was determined that the implementation details prevented this from being achievable.
- The advisory recommends revoking the old Let's Encrypt certificate even though it is not believed to be compromised.
- The vulnerability was discovered internally and quickly patched.
