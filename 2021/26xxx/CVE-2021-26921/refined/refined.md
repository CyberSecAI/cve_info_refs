Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26921:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that JWT (JSON Web Token) tokens issued via interactive password logins for Argo CD admin or local users could be used indefinitely, even after the associated account was disabled or had its login privileges revoked.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Lack of token revocation:** The system failed to check the current status of the user's account when validating JWTs. This allowed deactivated or restricted accounts to continue using previously issued tokens.
- **Insufficient access control:** The authentication process did not adequately verify the validity of the token against the current account status.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized access:** A malicious actor who had acquired a valid JWT for an admin or local user could retain access to the system, even after the account was disabled or its login privileges were revoked.
- **Privilege escalation:** If the compromised account had elevated privileges (e.g., admin), the attacker could perform privileged operations despite the account being deactivated.
- **Data breach/manipulation:** With continued access, the attacker could potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to have obtained a valid JWT via interactive login before the account was disabled or had its login privileges revoked.
- The attacker can then use the obtained JWT to gain access to the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have had access to a valid login at one point in time.
- The attacker does not need to have continued interactive login access.
- The attacker needs access to the previously generated JWT.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes the fix for the vulnerability, which involves checking the account status and login privileges before authenticating a request using JWT tokens.
- The vulnerability was reported by SAP SE and responsibly disclosed.
- The fix was released in Argo CD versions 1.7.12 and 1.8.4.
- Workarounds include changing the password of the affected users, disabling the admin account if it's not required, and disabling interactive login if not needed.
