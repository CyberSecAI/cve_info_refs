Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-26038

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of necessary hardcoded Access Control List (ACL) checks for superusers within the "install" action of the `com_installer` component in Joomla.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The primary weakness is the insufficient ACL enforcement for the `com_installer` component's install functionality. This allows users who are not intended to have installer privileges to potentially exploit the component.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation could lead to privilege escalation, granting unauthorized users elevated access and control over the Joomla installation.
- **Potential Attack Vectors:** The document specifies "various potential attack vectors" which are enabled by the improper access control, though it doesn't explicitly list these vectors.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The specific attack vectors are not detailed beyond noting that multiple vectors exist due to the insufficient ACL checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to access the `com_installer` component which, by default, is only available to superusers. However, due to the access control flaw, an attacker would likely need some level of legitimate access to Joomla, that should not include ability to access installer. This indicates that this is an issue with the authorization process not correctly limiting access to installer.
- The provided description notes "A default system is not affected cause by default com\_installer is limited to super users already". This would indicate that an attacker would need to bypass the default limitation to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Versions:**
- Joomla! CMS versions 2.5.0 through 3.9.27 are affected.

**Solution:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in Joomla! CMS version 3.9.28. Users are advised to upgrade to this version.
