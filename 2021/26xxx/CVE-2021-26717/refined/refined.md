```
- Root cause of vulnerability: When re-negotiating for T.38, if the initial remote response was delayed, Asterisk would send both audio and T.38 in the SDP. If the remote endpoint responded with a declined T.38 stream, Asterisk would crash.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability lies in the way Asterisk handles delayed responses during T.38 renegotiation, leading to an inconsistent state and a crash when a T.38 stream is declined after being offered alongside audio.
- Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the Asterisk server. This can disrupt communication services.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a delayed response during T.38 negotiation. This can be done by any authenticated remote session.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to have a remote authenticated session with the vulnerable Asterisk server.
