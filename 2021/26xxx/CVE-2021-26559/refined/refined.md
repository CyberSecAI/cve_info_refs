Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26559:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper Access Control on the Configurations endpoint within the Apache Airflow Stable API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the fact that users with "Viewer" or "User" roles can access Airflow configurations through the API, even when the `expose_config` setting is set to `False`. This setting is intended to restrict access to configurations via the webserver.
*   The intended access control was bypassed, allowing users to retrieve sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Users with low-privilege roles (Viewer or User) can gain access to sensitive configuration information.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of configuration data could reveal passwords, API keys, database connection strings, and other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a request to the Configurations endpoint of the Airflow API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a user account on Apache Airflow with either a "Viewer" or "User" role.

**Summary**

The vulnerability allows low-privileged users to bypass access controls and access sensitive configuration data via the API, which can be used for privilege escalation. The intended restriction on configuration visibility through the webserver is not honored by the API endpoint. The issue is present in Apache Airflow version 2.0.0, and it can be mitigated by upgrading to version 2.0.1 or by removing the read permission for configuration from the “Viewer” and “User” roles.
