- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `insert_slice_clone` function in `qwutils` crate uses `ptr::copy` which temporarily duplicates ownership of elements when inserting into the middle of a `Vec`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: If the `clone` method called on a user provided element panics during the copy operation, the element can be double-freed leading to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A double-free can occur, leading to memory corruption and potential denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when inserting a slice using `insert_slice_clone` into a `Vec` where the element's `clone` method panics.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to control the data inserted into the `Vec` such that the clone call on these elements panics when using the `insert_slice_clone` function. The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction.
