The content relates to CVE-2021-26195.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `lexer_parse_number` function within `js-lexer.c`. This is triggered when parsing a hexadecimal number literal with a trailing underscore (e.g., `0x100000000_`). The lexer attempts to read past the allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-buffer-overflow. Specifically, the code does not handle a trailing underscore properly when parsing a hexadecimal number literal, leading to out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A heap-buffer-overflow can lead to memory corruption, potentially causing a crash or allowing for arbitrary code execution. In this case, it leads to a crash due to the address sanitizer detecting the out-of-bounds read.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted JavaScript input containing a hexadecimal number literal with a trailing underscore.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to execute JavaScript code that will be parsed by the vulnerable `jerryscript` engine.
