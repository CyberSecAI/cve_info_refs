Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26712:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper SRTP replay protection in Asterisk. Specifically, the implementation did not correctly handle the sequence number rollover, leading to the possibility of replay attacks. A previous fix for ASTERISK-16867 unintentionally reset the sRTP-ROC (sRTP Roll-Over Counter) to zero, which made the system vulnerable to replay attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Lack of SRTP replay protection:** The core issue is the absence of a robust mechanism to detect and reject replayed SRTP packets.
- **Incorrect handling of sRTP-ROC:** The implementation unintentionally reset the sRTP-ROC which is critical for authenticating remote RTP packets, making the system vulnerable to replay attacks and leading to premature call teardown.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to prematurely terminate ongoing SRTP calls by replaying SRTP packets.
- **Disruption of Communication:** Successful exploitation can cause significant disruption to voice communication services relying on the affected Asterisk instances.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Remote, unauthenticated attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
- **SRTP packet replay:** The attack involves replaying previously captured or crafted SRTP packets.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send packets to the Asterisk server.
- **Ability to capture/craft SRTP packets:** The attacker needs to capture valid SRTP packets from an ongoing call or generate packets that mimic those.
- **No authentication required**:  The attacker does not need any valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects versions 13.38.1, 16.16.0, 17.9.1, and 18.2.0 of Asterisk Open Source and version 16.8-cert5 of Certified Asterisk.
- The fix introduces an `srtpreplayprotection` option in `rtp.conf`, which is enabled by default. This option implements SRTP replay protection and prevents the premature call teardown due to replay attacks.
- The affected modules are `res_srtp.c` and `res_rtp_asterisk.c`.
