Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-26333

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient access controls within the AMD Platform Security Processor (PSP) chipset driver.
*   Specifically, it allows non-privileged users to read uninitialized physical memory pages, where the original data has been moved or paged out.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The core weakness is the ability to expose sensitive data through memory reads.
*   **Insufficient Access Controls:**  The driver lacks proper controls to prevent low-privileged users from accessing memory that should be protected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A successful exploit enables a low-privileged malicious user to gain unauthorized access to potentially sensitive information residing in physical memory. This data could include personal information, security keys, or other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves a low-privileged user exploiting the vulnerable AMD PSP chipset driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have low-privileged access to the system where the vulnerable driver is installed.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability affects a wide range of AMD processors across desktop and mobile platforms
*   The issue was reported by Kyriakos Economou of ZeroPeril Ltd
*   The vulnerability is addressed in the AMD PSP driver 5.17.0.0 and AMD Chipset Driver 3.08.17.735.
