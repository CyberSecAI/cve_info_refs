Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a directory traversal vulnerability in the Enterprise License Manager portal of Mitel MiContact Center Enterprise. This is due to insufficient access control, allowing users to potentially access restricted files and folders.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to perform directory traversal. This means an attacker could use specially crafted file paths to access files and directories outside of the intended web root.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The underlying problem is that the application doesn't properly restrict access to files and folders, allowing unauthorized users to traverse the file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **View application data:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to view sensitive application data.
*  **Modify application data:**  An attacker could potentially modify application data. This could lead to a variety of malicious outcomes depending on the nature of the data modified, such as system compromise, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is located within the Enterprise License Manager portal, which implies the attack vector is likely via HTTP requests to the web interface.
*  The specific method of exploitation involves crafting requests containing directory traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need network access to the affected MiContact Center Enterprise system and access to the Enterprise License Manager portal. The attacker is not specified to require authentication, it may or may not be required, but the issue is that the access control mechanism fails to correctly restrict access based on the user privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Mitel has rated the risk of this vulnerability as "High".
*   The affected versions are MiContact Center Enterprise 9.3 SP3 and earlier.
*   Mitel recommends that customers update to the latest release of the software to mitigate this vulnerability.
