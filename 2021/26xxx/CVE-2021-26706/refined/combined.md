# µC/LIB Module

Designed with Micrium’s renowned quality, scalability and reliability, the purpose of µC/LIB is to provide a clean, organized ANSI C implementation of the most common standard library functions, macros, and constants.

### Portable

µC/LIB was designed for the vast variety of embedded applications. The source code for µC/LIB is designed to be independent of and used with any processor (CPU) and compiler.

### Scalable

The memory footprint of µC/LIB can be adjusted at compile time based on the features you need and the desired level of run-time performance.

### Coding Standards

Coding standards have been established early in the design of µC/LIB and include:

* C coding style
* Naming convention for `#define` constants, macros, variables and functions
* Commenting
* Directory structure

### MISRA C

The source code for µC/LIB follows the Motor Industry Software Reliability Association (MISRA) C Coding Standards. These standards were created by MISRA to improve the reliability and predictability of C programs in critical automotive systems. Members of the MISRA consortium include Delco Electronics, Ford Motor Company, Jaguar Cars Ltd., Lotus Engineering, Lucas Electronics, Rolls-Royce, Rover Group Ltd., and other firms and universities dedicated to improving safety and reliability in automotive electronics. Full details of this standard can be obtained directly from the MISRA web site, <http://www.misra.org.uk>.

### Safety Critical Certification

µC/LIB has been designed and implemented with safety critical certification in mind. µC/LIB is intended for use in any high-reliability, safety-critical systems including avionics RTCA DO-178B and EUROCAE ED-12B, medical FDA 510(k), IEC 61508 industrial control systems, and EN-50128 rail transportation and nuclear systems.

For example, the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) requires that all the source code for an application be available in source form and conforming to specific software standards in order to be certified for avionics systems. Since most standard library functions are provided by compiler vendors in uncertifiable binary format, µC/LIB provides its library functions in certifiable source-code format.

If your product is not safety critical, you should view the software and safety-critical standards as proof that µC/LIB is a very robust and highly-reliable software module.

### Limitations

By design,  µC/LIB does not support variable argument library functions.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Apply available vendor updates.
* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

# Common[#](#common)

Micrium OS Common is a module that groups common components used by various Micrium products. It currently includes:

* An authentication module which allows you to create users and manage their access rights
* An emulation of the C standard library, including functions for memory allocation and de-allocation including:

  + Data copy, compare
  + String copy, compare, replace
  + Some character functions and a basic random number generator (RNG)
* A kernel abstraction layer (KAL), which allows products to make an abstraction of the active kernel (OS2 or OS3)
* Logging capabilities available for every Micrium OS module
* For all the Micrium OS modules, there is a common error type and several related utilities
* A shell interface for Micrium OS components and any other components that register shell functions
* A toolchain detection and abstraction component

Most parts of Micrium OS Common are expected to be present in every Micrium OS project.
