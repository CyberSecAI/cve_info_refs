Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26920:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Apache Druid's HTTP InputSource handles data retrieval. It allows authenticated users to read data from unintended sources. Specifically, users can supply file URLs to the HTTP InputSource.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Input Handling:** The HTTP InputSource does not properly validate the provided URL, allowing access to local files.
- **Bypass of Application-Level Restrictions:** When an application restricts users from accessing certain InputSources (like Local), users can still access local files by using the HTTP InputSource with a `file://` URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Bypass access control:** By using the HTTP InputSource an attacker could potentially bypass application-level restrictions on access to the local file system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Users can supply a specially crafted URL to the HTTP InputSource, specifying local files using the `file://` URI scheme.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker must be an authenticated user of Apache Druid.
- The attacker does not require any special privilege within Druid.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided text indicates that the fix for this issue in 0.21.0 was incomplete and a second CVE (CVE-2021-36749) was issued to address the same vulnerability that was not fixed in 0.21.0 or 0.21.1.
- The recommended mitigation is to upgrade to version 0.22.0 or higher. In earlier versions, applications should disallow the Local, HTTP, and HDFS InputSources if local file system access needs to be restricted.
