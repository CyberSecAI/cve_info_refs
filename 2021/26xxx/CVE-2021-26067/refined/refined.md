- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A Sensitive Data Exposure vulnerability exists in the `/chart` endpoint of Atlassian Bamboo.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `/chart` endpoint allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to view a stack trace, which can reveal the path of the home directory on disk and whether specific files exist in the `tmp` directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain sensitive information, including the path to the home directory and information about the existence of temporary files. This information could be used in further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can access the vulnerable endpoint (`/chart?filename=<file_name>`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the affected Atlassian Bamboo instance. No authentication is required for the exploitation.
