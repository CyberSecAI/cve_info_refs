Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-26908:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Automox Agent improperly logs sensitive information on the local endpoint. Specifically, command-line arguments used by the agent to install endpoint security solutions, which can include sensitive data like site-specific tokens, are being logged.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information, such as site-specific tokens used to install security solutions, is being logged on the local endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially use the disclosed tokens to uninstall or deprovision the security solutions. This would be difficult to detect as it would look like normal authorized maintenance.
*   Malicious insiders can obtain site-specific information and potentially disable endpoint security.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs to have authenticated user access to an endpoint managed by the Automox Agent.
*   **Log File Access:** The attacker reads the local log files on the endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be an authenticated user on a system managed by the vulnerable Automox Agent.
*   The attacker needs the ability to access and read the local log files on the endpoint.
