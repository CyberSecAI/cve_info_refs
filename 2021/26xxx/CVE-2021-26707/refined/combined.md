## Summary

Merge-deep actively attempts to prevent prototype pollution by blocking object property merges into `__proto__`, however it still allows for prototype pollution of `Object.prototype` via a `constructor` payload.

## Product

[merge-deep](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/merge-deep) 3.0.2 (latest version)

## Tested Version

3.0.2

## Details

`merge-deep` can be tricked into overwriting properties of `Object.prototype` or adding new properties to it. These properties are then inherited by every object in the program.

Here is an example, in which we assume that `payload` is provided by an attacker, and `isAdmin` is a property that is later on used to check whether a user is authorized to perform some sensitive operation:

```
var mergeDeep = require("merge-deep");
var payload = '{"constructor": {"prototype": {"isAdmin": true}}}';
mergeDeep({}, JSON.parse(payload));

```

After this code has run, `Object.prototype.isAdmin` is `true`. But `Object.prototype` is on the prototype chain of most objects, so we also have `{}.isAdmin == true`, and indeed `u.isAdmin == true` for most other objects `u`, including, perhaps, objects used to represent users.

It is important to note that the above code snippet throws an exception (since `Object.prototype` cannot be reassigned), but it still sets the property (since it can be mutated). In some settings this might make the vulnerability difficult to exploit, but in others (for example web servers, which generally are written to be tolerant to route-handler crashes) it will still be easily exploitable.

#### Impact

JavaScript prototype pollution can lead to a variety of application context specific impacts ranging from Denial of Service (DoS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
