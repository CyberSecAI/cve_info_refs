Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-26707:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `merge-deep` Node.js library, specifically in versions prior to 3.0.3. The library's attempt to prevent prototype pollution was insufficient. While it blocked direct merging into `__proto__`, it failed to prevent pollution of `Object.prototype` using a `constructor` payload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is a prototype pollution issue. An attacker can manipulate the `constructor.prototype` property to inject or overwrite properties on `Object.prototype`. Since most objects inherit from `Object.prototype`, this leads to modification of properties across the application's object space.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially modify objects to reveal sensitive information that may be used to escalate privileges.
- **Data Modification:** Attackers can add or modify data by injecting new properties into `Object.prototype`, which can affect the behavior of the application.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By modifying the prototype, attackers could cause unexpected errors, crashes, or infinite loops, leading to a denial-of-service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In certain application contexts, prototype pollution can be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted JSON payload that includes a `constructor` property with a `prototype` property and malicious values, which will then be merged into an object.
- **Unsanitized Data:** If user-provided data is passed to the `merge-deep` function, it opens up the possibility of exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide input to the merge-deep function:** An attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious payload to the vulnerable `merge-deep` function.
- **Knowledge of how the application uses the function:** Understanding how the application uses the `merge-deep` function and handles the objects it modifies helps in crafting an effective attack.
- **No privilege is needed** to exploit the vulnerability, as the function operates without special permissions.

**Additional Details:**

- The `merge-deep` library is used to recursively merge values in a Javascript object.
- The vulnerability was reported to the maintainers of `merge-deep` by the GitHub Security Lab.
- Version 3.0.3 of `merge-deep` addresses this vulnerability.
- The patch involves adding an `isValidKey` function to ensure only valid keys are merged, preventing `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype` from being used as keys during merges.

The NetApp advisory indicates that multiple NetApp products incorporate Node.js, and the `merge-deep` library vulnerability could lead to "disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS)". The only NetApp product listed as affected was **NetApp E-Series Performance Analyzer**.
