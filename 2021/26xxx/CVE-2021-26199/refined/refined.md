{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a heap-use-after-free error in the `ecma_bytecode_ref` function, which occurs during the compilation of a regular expression using `RegExp.prototype.compile`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "The heap-use-after-free can lead to a crash due to an invalid memory access and potentially arbitrary code execution if exploited.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `RegExp.prototype.compile` method with a crafted regular expression pattern.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code that can call the vulnerable `RegExp.prototype.compile` method. The provided code demonstrates how this method can be called through a chain of function calls. The test case shows that it can be triggered with the regex `/a*/g`."
