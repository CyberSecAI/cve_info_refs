The content relates to CVE-2021-26750.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a DLL hijacking issue in the Agent for Panda Adaptive Defense 360.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a DLL hijacking issue. A specific service is vulnerable because it loads a malicious DLL due to a lack of proper path validation or other related security mechanism.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can achieve code execution and persistence by placing a malicious DLL where the vulnerable service will load it. Each time the service starts, the malicious DLL is executed.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker would need to place a malicious DLL in the directory or a location where the vulnerable service is attempting to load a legitimate DLL with the same name. The service loads the malicious DLL and runs it instead of the legitimate one.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have the ability to write files on the system where the vulnerable service is installed. They also need to know the name and location of the DLL that is being loaded by the vulnerable service in order to correctly name and place the malicious DLL.
