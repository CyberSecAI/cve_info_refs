- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `turl` parameter in the Report2Web Online Help feature allows a user-controlled path to be loaded inside a frame. The application does not properly validate or sanitize this path, enabling the use of `\/hostname.tld` which browsers interpret as a full URL, leading to the loading of arbitrary external content.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Frame injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary content into the frame, potentially leading to content injection, XSS, and other attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted GET request to the `/r2w/help/Online_Help/NetHelp/default.htm` endpoint with a malicious `turl` parameter value.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
