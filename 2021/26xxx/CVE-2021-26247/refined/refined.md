Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of the vulnerabilities related to the CVE:

**CVE-2021-26247**

The provided changelog from Cacti's website does not directly reference CVE-2021-26247. However, it does list several security vulnerabilities, identified by their GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA) IDs, that were addressed in various Cacti releases. Let's analyze the vulnerabilities that are relevant:

**1. XSS vulnerability when creating external links with the consolenewsection parameter (GHSA-49f2-hwx9-qffr):**
    - **Root Cause**: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input when creating external links using the `consolenewsection` parameter.
    - **Vulnerability**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    - **Impact**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the external links, leading to potential session hijacking or other client-side attacks.
    - **Attack Vector**: By crafting a malicious URL with the `consolenewsection` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser.
    - **Attacker Capabilities/Position**: An attacker needs to be able to create or modify external links within the Cacti system. This likely requires some level of authenticated access.

**2. XSS vulnerability when creating external links with the title parameter (GHSA-fgc6-g8gc-wcg5):**
    - **Root Cause**: Similar to the previous vulnerability, improper sanitization of user-supplied input using the `title` parameter.
    - **Vulnerability**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    - **Impact**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into external links, potentially stealing user sessions or performing other client-side attacks.
    - **Attack Vector**: A malicious URL containing the `title` parameter with a malicious script can be crafted.
    - **Attacker Capabilities/Position**: Similar to the previous vulnerability, the attacker needs to have the ability to create or modify external links.

**3. RCE vulnerability can be executed via Log Poisoning (GHSA-gxq4-mv8h-6qj4):**
    - **Root Cause**: Injection of malicious commands in log files, which are then executed by Cacti.
    - **Vulnerability**: Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    - **Impact**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server running Cacti.
    - **Attack Vector**: An attacker would need to be able to inject commands in log entries that would be executed by cacti when parsing the logs.
    - **Attacker Capabilities/Position**: Requires some access to Cacti server to inject the malicious log entries.

**4. XSS vulnerability when creating external links with the fileurl parameter (GHSA-wh9c-v56x-v77c):**
    - **Root Cause**: Inadequate sanitization of user input using the `fileurl` parameter when generating external links.
    - **Vulnerability**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
     - **Impact**: Same as above, leading to potential session hijacking or other client-side attacks.
    - **Attack Vector**: A malicious URL containing the `fileurl` parameter with a malicious script.
    - **Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker requires to have the ability to create or modify external links.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content provides more detail than the official CVE description, as it lists the specific GHSA IDs and parameters involved in each vulnerability.
*   These vulnerabilities are related to user-controlled input not being properly validated/sanitized.
*   The primary impact is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) which can be used to perform other attacks like session hijacking.
*   One vulnerability can result in Remote Code Execution (RCE) if an attacker is able to perform log poisoning.
