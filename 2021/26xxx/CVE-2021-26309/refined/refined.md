The provided content contains information about CVE-2021-26309.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Local information disclosure via a temporary file in the TeamCity IntelliJ Plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of temporary files within the TeamCity IntelliJ Plugin. Specifically, a temporary file is created in a location where its contents may be exposed to local users.

**Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker could potentially read sensitive information contained in the temporary file. This information could include configuration details, build parameters, or other data relevant to the TeamCity server or the IntelliJ project.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker would require local access to the system running the TeamCity IntelliJ Plugin and the temporary file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must have local access to the machine where the vulnerable TeamCity IntelliJ plugin is installed. They also need sufficient permissions to read the temporary file.
