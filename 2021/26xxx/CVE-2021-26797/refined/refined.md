Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26797:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a broken access control due to a weak default password for the Telnet service on Hame SD1 Wi-Fi devices with firmware version <= v.20140224154640

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Weak Password:** The primary vulnerability is the use of an easily guessable or brute-forceable password for the Telnet service.
*   **Open Telnet Service:** The Telnet service (port 23) is exposed, making it a target for remote attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **System Administrator Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain system administrator privileges on the affected device.
*   **Full Device Control:** Once administrator access is achieved, attackers can potentially modify device configurations, install malicious software, or use it as a point of entry into the network.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device, which could be from the local network, or remotely if the device is exposed to the internet.
*   **Brute-Force Attack:** The attacker uses a brute-force attack to guess the weak password for the Telnet service.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be on the same network or have network access to the vulnerable device.
*   **Basic Networking Tools:** The attacker needs tools like Nmap for service discovery and Hydra for brute-forcing login credentials.

**Additional Notes**
* The blog post includes screenshots demonstrating the process of scanning for the open Telnet port, brute-forcing the password with Hydra, and finally logging in via Telnet to obtain system access.
* The post references OWASP IoT TOP 10 2018, specifically "No1. Weak, Guessable, or Hardcoded Passwords", aligning the vulnerability with known security risks in IoT devices.
