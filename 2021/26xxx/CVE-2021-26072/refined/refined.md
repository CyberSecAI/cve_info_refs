- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the `widgetconnector` plugin of Atlassian Confluence Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `widgetconnector` plugin does not properly validate or sanitize user-provided input when making requests to external or internal resources. This allows an attacker to potentially manipulate the target URL.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An attacker can manipulate the content of internal network resources by controlling the target of the request.
    - In environments such as Amazon EC2, this could be used to access metadata resources that provide access credentials and other potentially confidential information.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the input provided to the `widgetconnector` plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the `widgetconnector` plugin, which requires low privileges. No user interaction is required. The attacker must be on the network and be able to send requests to the vulnerable Confluence server.
