Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-26402:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient bounds checking in the AMD Secure Processor (ASP) firmware when handling BIOS mailbox commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Lack of proper validation of the boundaries when processing BIOS mailbox commands in the ASP firmware. This allows an attacker to write data out-of-bounds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can write partially controlled data out-of-bounds to System Management Mode (SMM) or Secure Encrypted Virtualization - Encrypted State (SEV-ES) regions. This can lead to:
    *   Loss of integrity: The attacker can modify the content of memory regions outside of the intended boundaries.
    *   Loss of availability: System instability due to corrupted data, potentially leading to crashes or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered through the handling of BIOS mailbox commands.
*   A malicious actor could exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted BIOS mailbox commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to send commands to the BIOS mailbox, which is typically achieved via software vulnerabilities or malicious firmware.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered high severity.
*   The vulnerability affects AMD EPYC processors.
*   Mitigation requires updating the AGESA firmware.
*   The vulnerability impacts SEV-ES and SNP (Secure Nested Paging) enabled environments.
*   The issue was found during security reviews in collaboration with Google, Microsoft, and Oracle.
*   The fix was made available in RomePI 1.0.0.B and MilanPI 1.0.0.8.
