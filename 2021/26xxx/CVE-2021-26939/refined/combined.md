| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1182095#c0)  Alexander Bergmann   2021-02-11 07:31:41 UTC  ``` CVE-2021-26939  An information disclosure issue exists in henriquedornas 5.2.17 because an attacker can dump phpMyAdmin SQL content.  References: <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-26939> <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-26939> <https://github.com/0xrayan/CVE-/discussions/4> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1182095#c1)  Andreas Stieger   2021-02-11 09:35:56 UTC  ``` This vulnerability describes an SQL dump left in a publicly accessible web path of a web consultancy. This it not a software product, just an operational error. Not a problem with phpMyAdmin. The CVE itself should be disputed. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1182095#c2)  Andreas Stieger   2021-02-12 19:47:20 UTC  ``` CVE disputed, not in phpMyAdmin ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1182095#c3)  Marcus Meissner   2023-02-02 10:56:57 UTC  ``` was done ``` |  |
