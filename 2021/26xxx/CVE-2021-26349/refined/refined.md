{
  "CVE-2021-26349": {
    "Root cause": "Failure to assign a new report ID to an imported guest.",
    "Weaknesses": "The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of report IDs during guest VM migration, specifically within the SEV-SNP (Secure Encrypted Virtualization - Secure Nested Paging) environment.",
    "Impact": "An SEV-SNP guest VM might be tricked into trusting a dishonest Migration Agent (MA) due to the failure in assigning a new report ID.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves the migration of an SEV-SNP guest VM by a malicious or compromised migration agent.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be in a position to act as or compromise the migration agent used to transfer a virtual machine from one hypervisor to another. The attacker does not need to have privileged access inside of the virtual machine to carry out the attack, and the guest could potentially be in a different host. The attacker can then modify the VM to trick the new hypervisor into thinking it is a legitimate migration."
