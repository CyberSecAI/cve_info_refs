Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-26400:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the speculative reordering of load instructions by AMD processors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Speculative Execution:** The processor speculatively executes instructions, which, if mispredicted, can lead to unintended side effects.
- **Load Reordering:** Load instructions can be reordered speculatively, potentially causing a processor to read stale data from memory.
- **Shared Memory Access:** The vulnerability is triggered when multiple processors operate on shared memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Leakage:** The primary impact is the potential for data leakage due to the observation of stale data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting speculative execution by manipulating shared memory access across multiple processors.
- This vulnerability requires a specific memory access pattern and speculative execution behavior in the CPU.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence shared memory access across multiple processors.
- This vulnerability would likely require code execution on the target system to influence the execution patterns of the processors.

**Additional Details:**
- The document mentions that there are no new mitigations and points to the Architecture Programmerâ€™s Manual Vol 2, sections 7.1.1 and 7.1.3.
- The vulnerability was reported by Danping Li and Ziyuan Zhu from the Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
