Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26938:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the `henriquedornas` product, specifically version 5.2.17.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The product fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code into the application's database.
- This stored payload can then be executed within the browser of other users when the malicious input is rendered.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser. This could lead to:
  - Stealing sensitive information (cookies, session tokens)
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user
  - Redirecting the user to a malicious website
  - Defacing the website
  - Other malicious activities depending on the access level of the affected user

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted input, specifically an `<img>` tag with an `onerror` attribute containing JavaScript. This input is submitted to the application and stored.
- When the stored data is displayed, the malicious JavaScript payload is executed by the victim's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to input data into the vulnerable application.
- No special privilege is needed; any user that can input data is able to inject the XSS payload.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content includes the specific payload: `<img src=1 onerror="javascript:alert(1)"></img>`
- Screenshots are provided, showcasing the XSS payload triggering an alert box on the target site.
