- **Root cause of vulnerability:**
  - Undefined behavior due to constructing byte slices using `std::slice::from_raw_parts()` with data from `#[repr(Rust)]` structs in `VendorInfo::as_string()`, `SoCVendorBrand::as_string()`, and `ExtendedFunctionInfo::processor_brand_string()`.
  - Exposing the unsafe `__cpuid_count()` intrinsic as a safe function in `native_cpuid::cpuid_count()` without checking if the CPU supports the function, violating safety requirements.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Memory corruption due to undefined behavior from incorrect slice construction.
  - Potential for denial-of-service due to crashes when `cpuid_count()` is called on unsupported CPUs.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - Undefined behavior can lead to unpredictable program behavior, potentially causing crashes or data corruption.
  - Programs calling `cpuid_count()` on unsupported CPUs will crash.

- **Attack vectors:**
  - Calling the vulnerable `as_string()` methods.
  - Calling `native_cpuid::cpuid_count()` on CPUs that do not support the CPUID instruction.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - Ability to execute code that calls the vulnerable methods within the `raw-cpuid` library.

- **Additional details:**
  - The vulnerability is present in the `raw-cpuid` crate versions prior to 9.0.0.
  - The `as_string()` issues were fixed by changing the struct representation to `#[repr(C)]`.
  - The `cpuid_count()` issue was addressed by breaking compilation on SGX or 32-bit x86 without SSE, effectively preventing use on unsupported platforms.
  - The vulnerability affects x86 and x86_64 architectures.
