{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow that occurs when processing CUR files. Specifically, the `BitCount` field within the `BITMAPINFOHEADER` structure is read and used in a left shift operation (`shl eax, cl`). A large value for `BitCount` results in an excessive number of bytes being read from the file, which corrupts the SEH chain on the stack.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow",
    "Improper input validation/handling",
    "Uncontrolled data read from file"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can gain control of the application's execution flow, bypassing both ASLR and DEP mitigations and allowing execution of arbitrary code on the victim's machine.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malformed/specially crafted CUR file opened or viewed by a user through the vulnerable application",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to create a specially crafted CUR file and convince a user to open it through the vulnerable FastStone Image Viewer application. No special network access is required"
