Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-26593:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the Directus API disclosing sensitive two-factor authentication (2FA) secrets for all users. This allows an attacker to retrieve the 2FA secret used for generating one-time passwords.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The API endpoint for user data reveals the `2fa_secret` parameter, which should be treated as highly sensitive.
- **Lack of Access Control:** The API allows a connected, non-admin user to retrieve 2FA secrets of other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** With the leaked 2FA secrets, an attacker can generate valid one-time passwords for any user. Combined with stolen credentials or by using the user enumeration vulnerability described in the same document, this leads to full account takeover.
- **Bypass Multi-Factor Authentication:** An attacker can bypass the two-factor authentication mechanism, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **API Endpoint:** The attacker sends an HTTP request to the Directus API endpoint that returns user information.
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** Potentially a MITM attacker can intercept the sensitive data being passed over the network between client and server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid account and be logged into the Directus application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to communicate with the Directus API server.
