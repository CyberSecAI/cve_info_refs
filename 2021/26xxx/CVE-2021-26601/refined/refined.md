Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `image-edit.php` script of ImpressCMS.
- User-controlled input from the `image_temp` parameter is directly used in the `unlink()` function without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Path Traversal:** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to manipulate the `image_temp` parameter to include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** By controlling the path passed to `unlink()`, an attacker can delete files anywhere on the server's filesystem where the web server process has permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker can delete any file accessible to the web server process, potentially disrupting the website's functionality or causing data loss.
- **Potential Information Disclosure:** If the webserver allows directory listing, the attacker might be able to disclose the content of arbitrary files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `/libraries/image-editor/image-edit.php` script.
- The attack vector involves manipulating the `image_temp` parameter with path traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the ImpressCMS installation to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send requests to the web server running ImpressCMS.
