- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to rearrange memory in the guest address space without detection by the attestation mechanism in AMD's Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) and SEV-ES features. This can be exploited by a malicious hypervisor.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Lack of proper memory integrity checks during attestation.
    - Permutation-agnostic remote attestation allows memory rearrangement.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious hypervisor can exploit this vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution within the guest virtual machine.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a malicious hypervisor.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires administrative access to the server hypervisor.
