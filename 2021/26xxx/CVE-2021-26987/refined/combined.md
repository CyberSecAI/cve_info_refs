**Advisory ID:** NTAP-20210315-0001
**Version:**
2.0

**Last updated:**
06/29/2022

**Status:**
Final.

**CVEs:** CVE-2021-26987

Overview
#### Summary

Element Plug-in for vCenter Server incorporates SpringBoot Framework. SpringBoot Framework versions prior to 1.3.2 are susceptible to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could lead to Remote Code Execution. All versions of Element Plug-in for vCenter Server, Management Services versions prior to 2.17.56 and Management Node versions through 12.2 contain vulnerable versions of SpringBoot Framework.

#### Impact

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).

In order to upgrade to a fixed version of Management Services the storage cluster must be running NetApp Element software and management node version 11.3 or later.

For existing vSphere environments with a registered NetApp Element Plug-in for vCenter Server (VCP), update the plug-in registration after updating the management services package by following these instructions: <https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/hci/docs/task_vcp_upgrade_plugin.html>

If the storage cluster and management node are running versions prior to Element Software 11.3, please contact NetApp Support to schedule an upgrade.
