- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the usage of vulnerable SpringBoot Framework versions prior to 1.3.2 in Element Plug-in for vCenter Server, Management Services for Element Software and NetApp HCI, and NetApp SolidFire & HCI Management Node.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Usage of vulnerable versions of the SpringBoot Framework leads to a Remote Code Execution vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely. The CVSS vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L` indicates a network attack vector with low complexity, no privileges required, no user interaction and a scope change. The impact includes high confidentiality, low integrity, and low availability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without requiring any privileges or user interaction.
