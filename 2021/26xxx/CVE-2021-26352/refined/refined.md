Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-26352:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient bounds checks in the System Management Unit (SMU) PCIe Hot Plug table.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The SMU does not properly validate the boundaries when accessing the PCIe Hot Plug table.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Access/updates from/to an invalid address space.
- Denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is present in the System Management Unit (SMU) firmware, specifically when handling PCIe hot plug events. An attacker could potentially exploit this by manipulating data related to the PCIe Hot Plug table.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to have some level of control to influence the SMU's interaction with the PCIe hot plug table. This might require elevated privileges or control over system hardware or software components that interface with the SMU. The content indicates this vulnerability affects various AMD processors, suggesting the attacker may need to have access to a system running the affected processor and be able to influence the SMU.
