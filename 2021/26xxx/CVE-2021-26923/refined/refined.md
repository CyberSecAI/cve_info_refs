Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-26923:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `/version` endpoint in Argo CD was unauthenticated.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The unauthenticated `/version` endpoint exposed version information about Argo CD and its underlying tooling.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Attackers could obtain information about the specific version of Argo CD, including the underlying tooling. This information could potentially be used to identify known vulnerabilities or plan further attacks against the system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Direct access to the `/version` endpoint through an unauthenticated HTTP request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the Argo CD server to access the `/version` endpoint. No prior authentication is needed.

**Additional details:**

*   The advisory mentions that exposing version information is desirable in some CI use cases.
*   The maintainers mitigated the vulnerability by removing the tooling version information from the unauthenticated `/version` endpoint. The Argo CD version is still exposed on this endpoint because it can be easily discovered through other public means.
*   The advisory also provides alternative methods for an attacker to determine the version of Argo CD, even if the `/version` endpoint is secured, by downloading UI assets or the CLI binary.
