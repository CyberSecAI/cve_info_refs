Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `pay.php` file of the DoyoCMS application.
- The issue arises from an error in the CMS filter function, specifically how it handles arrays, leading to ineffective filtering and allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, enabling an attacker to manipulate database queries.
- **Inadequate Input Filtering:** The CMS filter function fails to properly sanitize input, particularly when dealing with array parameters.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without needing administrator login credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Database Information Exposure:** Attackers can potentially retrieve sensitive data from the database (as demonstrated by using `version()`).
- **Database Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- **Full System Compromise:** Depending on the database user's privileges, the attacker might be able to perform other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `pay.php` file, specifically through the `cartadd` action.
- **Manipulated URL Parameters:** The attacker injects SQL code through the `attribute[]` parameter within the URL.
- **Example URL:**  `http://192.168.0.105/?c=pay&a=cartadd&id=1&quantity=1&attribute[]=123123' or updatexml(2,concat(0x7e,(version())),0) or'`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTTP requests and URL manipulation.
- **No Prior Authentication:** No prior authentication or login is required to exploit the vulnerability.
