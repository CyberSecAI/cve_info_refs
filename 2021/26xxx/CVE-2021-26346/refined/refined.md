{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Failure to validate the integer operand in ASP (AMD Secure Processor) bootloader.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow in the L2 directory table in SPI flash.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Potential denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can introduce the integer overflow.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to influence the ASP bootloader's integer operand, which may require the ability to modify SPI flash or other lower level access."
