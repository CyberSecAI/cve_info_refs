Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26751:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `det` HTTP GET parameter within the `/Monitoring-History.php` endpoint, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application fails to neutralize special elements used in an SQL command, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can access all data in the database, including sensitive information such as user credentials.
*   Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the web application, potentially including the ability to achieve remote code execution (RCE) if combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the web interface via HTTP GET requests to `/Monitoring-History.php`.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `det`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs valid credentials for the NeDi web interface.
*   Some events have to be present in the Monitoring History graphs.
*   The attacker can then manipulate the `det` parameter to inject SQL code.
