  "CVE-2021-26329": {
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in the AMD System Management Unit (SMU) when an invalid length is provided.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Potential loss of resources due to the overflow.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker provides an invalid length to the SMU.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to interact with the SMU and provide an invalid length. This likely means the attacker has some level of access to the system, possibly through a malicious or compromised UApp."
