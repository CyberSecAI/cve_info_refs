Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-26379:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input validation of mailbox data in the AMD System Management Unit (SMU).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of proper validation of input data sent to the SMU through the mailbox interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can coerce the SMU to corrupt SMRAM (System Management RAM).
- This can lead to a loss of integrity and privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable via the SMU's mailbox interface.
- An attacker needs to be able to send crafted messages to this interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the SMU's mailbox interface.
- This could potentially be achieved by a privileged attacker who has already compromised other system components.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects AMD EPYC™ servers.
- Mitigation is provided through AGESA™ PI packages. The specific versions required to mitigate this CVE are RomePI 1.0.0.E for 2nd Gen AMD EPYC processors and MilanPI 1.0.0.9 for 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processors.
- SEV (Secure Encrypted Virtualization) , SEV-ES and SEV-SNP are affected by this vulnerability.
