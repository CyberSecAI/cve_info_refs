Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-26365:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient bounds checking during the parsing of firmware binary headers. Specifically, certain size values within these headers are not properly validated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The lack of size validation can cause out-of-bounds reads during signature validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of service:** The out-of-bounds read can cause a denial of service.
- **Limited information disclosure:** There is a potential for limited leakage of information about out-of-bounds memory contents.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing and signature validation of firmware binary headers. It is not specified whether the attacker can provide the vulnerable binary or if this is triggered by an already compromised system.
- It is implied the attack is performed locally.
- The attacker needs to be privileged.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path within the AMD Secure Processor (ASP).
- The attacker needs to have a privileged access.
