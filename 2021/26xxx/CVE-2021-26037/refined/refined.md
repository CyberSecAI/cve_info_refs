Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-26037:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper session termination in various Joomla! CMS functions. Specifically, existing user sessions were not terminated when a user's password was changed or when the user was blocked.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate session management.
- Failure to invalidate existing sessions upon password change or account blocking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  A user whose password has been changed or account has been blocked may still have active sessions. This could allow an attacker who has already gained access via a previous session to continue exploiting a user account even after the user has attempted to secure their account via a password change or block.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  An attacker could exploit this by gaining an initial session (e.g. via compromised password), the user changes their password, but the attackers existing session remains valid. 

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an active session before the user changes their password or gets blocked.
- The attacker may gain the session through password theft, social engineering or other methods.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is categorized as having a "Moderate" impact and "Low" severity.
- This issue affects Joomla! CMS versions 2.5.0 to 3.9.27.
- The fix is available in Joomla! CMS version 3.9.28
