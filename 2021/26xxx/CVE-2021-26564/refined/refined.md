Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-26564

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the cleartext transmission of sensitive information during HTTP redirection in Synology QuickConnect servers. When a user attempts to access their Synology device remotely via a QuickConnect link (e.g., `http://QuickConnect.to/qcrouterid`), the server redirects the connection to an HTTP address even if the user attempts to connect via HTTPS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cleartext Transmission:** The initial QuickConnect link uses HTTP, and even if the user tries to use HTTPS, the server redirects to HTTP, exposing data in transit to potential eavesdropping.
*   **HTTP Redirection Downgrade:** The server forces a downgrade from HTTPS to HTTP, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Algorithm Downgrade:** The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-757, which refers to the selection of a less secure algorithm during negotiation. In this case, the negotiation is for the transport protocol, downgrading from secure HTTPS to insecure HTTP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept the initial HTTP request and subsequent communication, potentially stealing device credentials.
*   **Credential Theft:** By intercepting the unencrypted HTTP traffic, an attacker can gain access to user credentials sent through the connection.
*   **Server Spoofing**: An attacker can impersonate remote QuickConnect servers.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker needs to be positioned between the user and the Synology QuickConnect server to intercept the initial HTTP request and redirect the user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be in a position to perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the network connection between the user and the Synology QuickConnect server.
*   The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The user has to initiate the connection to a QuickConnect link for the attack to take place.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The Talos report mentions that this issue is aggravated by another vulnerability (TALOS-2020-1059), allowing an attacker to force a user's browser to provide a valid cookie through the unencrypted HTTP connection, which would enable further exploitation.
*   The Synology advisory also lists CVE-2021-26564 as a cleartext transmission vulnerability in `synorelayd` that allows man-in-the-middle attacks to spoof servers via HTTP.
*   This vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 score of 8.3, indicating a high severity.
*   The vulnerability is present in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before version 6.2.3-25426-3.
