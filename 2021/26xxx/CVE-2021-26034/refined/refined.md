- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing token check in data download endpoints within the `com_banners` and `com_sysinfo` components.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially trick a logged-in administrator into unintentionally triggering data downloads via crafted requests.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by exploiting the lack of CSRF protection in the download endpoints. An attacker would need to craft a malicious request, for example using a link or form on a website that is visited by a logged-in administrator, that forces the download of data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking on a malicious link or submitting a malicious form. They do not need to have access to the Joomla system, but rely on exploiting the user's active session.
