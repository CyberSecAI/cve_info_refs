Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-26844

**Vulnerable Product:** PA Server Monitor

**Vulnerable Version:** 8.2.1.1

**Vendor:** Power Admin LLC

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically within the "hint" field of the Remote Access settings. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code that is then executed by the victim's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user input in the "hint" field, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Sensitive Information Theft:** The attacker can potentially steal cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive information.
*   **Webpage Defacement:** The attacker can modify the content of the web page, potentially defacing the application.
*   **Further Attacks:** The injected script could be used as a stepping stone to launch other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker injects a malicious payload into the "hint" field under Settings -> Remote Access.
*   The attacker then forces a user to refresh the affected page which triggers the malicious code to execute within the victim's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to access and modify the Remote Access settings of the PA Server Monitor application.
*   The attacker needs to craft a valid XSS payload.
*   The attacker needs to induce a victim to load or refresh a page that displays the injected payload
