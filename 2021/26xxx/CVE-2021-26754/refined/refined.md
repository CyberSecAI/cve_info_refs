Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-26754:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The content from `n4nj0.github.io` directly relates to CVE-2021-26754, detailing a SQL injection vulnerability found in the wpDataTables plugin. The other content sources provide general information about the plugin but do not contain specific vulnerability details.

**2. Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `order` parameter of the table search functionality, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The core weakness is the failure to properly neutralize special elements used in SQL commands. This allows an attacker to manipulate the database query.
    *   **Unauthenticated access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users, making it widely accessible.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Breach:** An attacker can gain access to all data within the WordPress database, including sensitive information like user credentials and application settings.
    *   **Complete System Compromise:** With access to the database and potentially admin credentials, an attacker can fully compromise the WordPress application, possibly leading to remote code execution through plugin or theme modification.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *  **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint, specifically targeting the `order[0][dir]` parameter.
    *  **Unauthenticated Exploit:** No prior authentication or user privileges are needed, making the vulnerability easily exploitable.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress instance to send the malicious request.
    *   **No Special Privileges:** No user account or administrator credentials are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**3. Technical Details**

*   **Affected Component:** The wpDataTables plugin (versions <= 3.4).
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `order[0][dir]` in the HTTP POST request.
*   **Vulnerable Endpoint:** `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=get_wdtable&table_id=[table_id]`
*   **Payload Example**: The `n4nj0.github.io` article provides a specific example using SQLMap to exploit the vulnerability, including commands to retrieve the database banner and dump user information.
*   **Example Request** : A crafted request includes the following payload `order[0][dir]=asc' AND (SELECT 1 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))A) AND '1'='1` in the request body when performing a table search on the front end.

**4. Remediation**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in wpDataTables version 3.4.1 and later. Users of prior versions should update immediately.

**5. Additional Notes:**

*   The `n4nj0.github.io` article emphasizes the professional and prompt response by the wpDataTables developers in addressing this vulnerability.

**In summary, CVE-2021-26754 describes a critical SQL injection vulnerability in the wpDataTables plugin that allows unauthenticated attackers to compromise the WordPress database.**
