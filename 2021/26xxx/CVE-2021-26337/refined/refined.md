Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-26337:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient DRAM address validation in the System Management Unit (SMU).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The SMU does not properly validate the DRAM address before performing a DMA read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A DMA read from an invalid DRAM address to SRAM occurs, leading to the SMU not servicing further requests. This results in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the SMU by triggering an invalid DMA read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to cause the SMU to perform a DMA read to an arbitrary DRAM address, which is not specified in detail. However, the document does mention that this can occur through a malformed system call.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is listed as having a "Medium" severity, with a score of 6.1.
- The vulnerability is mitigated by updating to specific versions of AMD AGESAâ„¢ PI software.
