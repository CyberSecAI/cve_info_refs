- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the unpacking of TAR archives in Gradle Enterprise Distributed Testing. The unpacking process is susceptible to a "Zip Slip" vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A "Zip Slip" vulnerability is present where a maliciously crafted archive can create or overwrite arbitrary files on the local file system during unpacking.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could create or overwrite arbitrary files on the local file system, potentially leading to compromise of the build or agent environment.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - A malicious actor with network access and test distribution agent registration credentials could register an alternative agent implementation to send a crafted archive to the build site.
    - A malicious actor with network access and test distribution usage credentials could register an alternative client implementation to send a crafted archive to the test execution site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires:
    - Network access.
    - Test distribution agent registration credentials or test distribution usage credentials.
    - Ability to register alternative agent or client implementations.
