Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `edit_stud.php` file of the CASAP-Automated-Enrollment-System.
- The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of the `id` parameter when used in an SQL query within the `edit_stud.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The `id` parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, making the system vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code using the `id` parameter.
- This allows an attacker to potentially:
    - Gain unauthorized access to the database.
    - Read, modify, or delete sensitive data.
    - Potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands, which could lead to full system compromise if the database user has sufficient permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET/POST Request:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter within a GET or POST request targeting `edit_stud.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `edit_stud.php` file.
- No special authentication or privileges are mentioned, suggesting the vulnerability could be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker depending on the system's access controls.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes screenshots that serve as proof of concept demonstrating the successful injection of SQL code.
- The content mentions specific details about the software, its source, and the vulnerable file, which is useful for understanding the attack context.
