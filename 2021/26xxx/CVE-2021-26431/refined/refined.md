Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper access control prior to authentication on the Windows lock screen.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Improper Access Control: The system fails to enforce adequate access control mechanisms before a user is authenticated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Authentication Bypass: An attacker can bypass the Windows lock screen authentication and gain unauthorized access to the system.
*   Complete compromise of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system (High Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impact).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Physical Access: The attacker needs to be physically present at the machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Physical Presence: The attacker must have physical access to the target machine.
*   No Authentication Required: The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.
