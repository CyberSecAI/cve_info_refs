Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26914:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause for CVE-2021-26914, as well as CVE-2021-26912, CVE-2021-26913, and CVE-2021-26915, is the insecure deserialization of untrusted data within the NetMotion Mobility Server. Specifically, multiple servlets within the application use `ObjectInputStream.readObject()` on attacker-controlled input without proper validation or sanitization, which allows for the injection and execution of arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The application deserializes attacker-controlled data without proper validation, which can lead to remote code execution.
*   **Multiple Vulnerable Endpoints:**  The advisory identifies several vulnerable servlets including `SupportRpcServlet`, `EventRpcServlet`, `MvcServlet` and `webrepdb StatusServlet`. Each of these servlets improperly handles deserialization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the NetMotion Mobility server with SYSTEM privileges, leading to a complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through HTTP requests to specific servlets.
    *   `SupportRpcServlet`: The attacker sends a POST request with a serialized payload in the request body.
    *  `EventRpcServlet`: The attacker sends a POST request with a serialized payload in the request body.
    *   `MvcServlet`: The attacker sends a GET or POST request with the malicious payload in the  `Mvc_x_Form_x_Name` query parameter, encoded using base64 and gzip.
    *   `webrepdb StatusServlet`: The attacker sends a POST request with a serialized payload in the request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable NetMotion Mobility Server and be able to send HTTP requests to the affected servlets.
*   The attacker does not need any authentication credentials, making it an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to be able to generate a serialized Java object payload, which can be achieved by using tools like ysoserial.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability exists in NetMotion Mobility Server version 12.01.09045.
*   Patched versions are Mobility v11.73 and v12.02.
* The advisory mentions the use of Java deserialization gadgets such as CommonsCollections6 and URLDNS to demonstrate exploitation.
* NetMotion advises users to place servers behind a firewall, highlighting the vulnerability when exposed to untrusted networks
