Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-26723:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization when handling the `query` parameter in the `/ics?tool=search` URL of Jenzabar software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application reflects user-supplied input within the HTML output without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into the web page.
- When a victim clicks a crafted link containing the malicious payload, the attacker's script executes within the victim's browser session in the context of the vulnerable website.
- The attacker can potentially perform various malicious actions, such as:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    - Defacing the vulnerable site.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing a malicious payload in the `query` parameter of the `/ics?tool=search` endpoint.
- The attacker must convince a user to click the crafted link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL with a malicious payload.
- The attacker needs to distribute this crafted URL, typically through methods like phishing, social engineering, or by embedding it on another website.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Jenzabar versions 9.2.0 through 9.2.2.
- The provided payload to trigger the vulnerability is: `"><script>alert(1)</script>`
- A sample vulnerable URL is: `https://my.example.edu/ics?tool=search&query="><script>alert(1)</script>`
- The vulnerability is a reflected XSS, meaning the malicious script is not permanently stored on the server.
- A workaround is advised: to not click suspicious links.
