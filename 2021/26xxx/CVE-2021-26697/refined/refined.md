Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26697:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The lineage endpoint of the deprecated Experimental API in Apache Airflow 2.0.0 lacked authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing Authentication Check: The primary vulnerability is the absence of authentication checks on the lineage endpoint of the Experimental API. This allows unauthenticated users to access the endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can access metadata about DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) and tasks. The severity is low as the exposed information is limited to metadata.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable Airflow instance over the network.
- API Endpoint Access: The attacker needs to directly target the lineage endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker must have network access to the Airflow instance.
- Knowledge of the API Endpoint: The attacker must be aware of the specific lineage endpoint within the Experimental API.
- Knowledge of required parameters: The attacker needs to know which parameters to pass to the endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Experimental API is deprecated, which might reduce the overall impact, but still represents a security flaw.
- The vulnerability is specific to Apache Airflow version 2.0.0.
- The information disclosure is limited to DAG and task metadata, making the severity low.
- The CVE was reported by Ian Carroll.
