### @peterhillman **[peterhillman](/peterhillman)** commented [Feb 22, 2021](#issue-813086786)

Address issues:

<https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=31221>

<https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=31228>

(also, all example images read through `exrcheck` when compiled with the undefined behavior sanitizer)

exrcheck had the usual thorny bugs handling images with massively offset data windows. Where dataWindow.min.{x,y} are very large or very negative, 32 bit integer arithmetic overflows and/or negative pointer arithmetic occurred.

I suggest amending the comment to 'pointer arithmetic may overflow on 32 bit architectures'

I have amended accordingly. I think this is architecture dependent, and more to do with the size of ints.

The value of 'memOffset' needs to be computed with 64 bit arithmetic. For example, if dataWindow.min.y\*width is greater than 2^31 and dataWindow.min.x is very negative, the end result should be a relatively small number.

Also, I think memOffset needs to be 64 bits on a 64 bit architecture.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Choose a reason  Spam Abuse Off Topic Outdated Duplicate Resolved    Hide comment      I have amended accordingly. I think this is architecture dependent, and more to do with the size of ints. The value of 'memOffset' needs to be computed with 64 bit arithmetic. For example, if dataWindow.min.y\*width is greater than 2^31 and dataWindow.min.x is very negative, the end result should be a relatively small number. Also, I think memOffset needs to be 64 bits on a 64 bit architecture.        Sorry, something went wrong.     All reactions | | |
