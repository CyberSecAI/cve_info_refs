  "CVE-2021-26945": {
    "Description": "Integer-overflow in bool Imf_2_5::readDeepTile<Imf_2_5::DeepTiledInputPart>",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow when calculating the offset into an array, which can lead to heap-buffer overflows. The calculation is done using 32-bit integers and if `dataWindow.min.x` or `dataWindow.min.y` is large, the calculation can result in a negative value, leading to out-of-bounds memory access when used to calculate a memory offset.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Heap-buffer-overflow",
       "Out-of-bounds memory access"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can potentially cause a crash of the application compiled with OpenEXR.",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious image file with specific parameters (large or negative `dataWindow.min.x` or `dataWindow.min.y`), an attacker can trigger the integer overflow when the image is processed by OpenEXR. This crafted image would be processed by the vulnerable code.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create and provide specially crafted OpenEXR image files. The attacker would likely need some understanding of the OpenEXR file format and the relevant data structures (particularly the `dataWindow` parameters). The target would need to process the malicious file through a vulnerable version of OpenEXR."
