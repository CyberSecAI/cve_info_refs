| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Synology DS418play. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the iscsi\_snapshot\_comm\_core service. The issue results from the lack of proper locking when performing operations on an object, which can cause a pointer to be reused after it has been freed. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the current process. |
