Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2021-26805.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability occurs due to an incorrect pointer handling in the `VC1Unit::vc1_unescape_buffer` function, specifically when copying data into the `m_nalBuffer`. The `m_nalBuffer` pointer was being incremented within a loop, leading to the pointer becoming invalid before the destructor attempts to free the memory. Additionally, a standard `delete` was used instead of `delete[]` to free the memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Heap-buffer-overflow: Writing beyond the allocated memory region.
  - Incorrect memory deallocation: Using `delete` instead of `delete[]` for an array.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A heap-buffer-overflow could lead to a crash or potentially allow an attacker to overwrite memory, potentially executing arbitrary code. The provided ASan log shows a crash due to a heap-buffer-overflow.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by processing a malformed or crafted input file, in this case, `poc.wav` which is a specially crafted MP4 file that causes the tsmuxer to crash when processing it as a VC1 stream.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to provide a malicious input file to tsmuxer, and would thus need to be able to execute the tsmuxer program with this malicious input file.
