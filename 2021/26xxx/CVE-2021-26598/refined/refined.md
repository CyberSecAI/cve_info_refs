{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The /include/findusers.php script uses a security token to validate access, and tokens are generated in places accessible to unauthenticated users.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect Access Control. The findusers.php script, intended for authenticated users, can be accessed by unauthenticated users with a valid security token.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Unauthorized access to the findusers.php script, potentially leading to information disclosure about CMS users.",
  "Attack vectors": "An unauthenticated attacker can access the vulnerable script by providing a valid security token. The token can be obtained from other parts of the application that do not require authentication (e.g., misc.php).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the web application and obtain a valid security token generated by the application. No prior authentication is needed."
