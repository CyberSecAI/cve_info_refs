Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26291:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content from `www.openwall.com_4d84bd28_20250114_224214.html`  explicitly mentions `CVE-2021-26291: Apache Maven: block repositories using http by default` along with a description and references. This confirms the content relates to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Apache Maven by default follows repository references defined in a dependencyâ€™s Project Object Model (pom). This can be problematic if an attacker compromises a repository or can perform a man-in-the-middle attack by pretending to be that repository.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability arises from Maven's behavior of following HTTP (non-SSL) repository references by default which leaves it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Impact:** A successful attack could lead to the injection of malicious code into a build process, compromising software builds.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Compromising a legitimate HTTP repository.
    *   Performing a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept requests for a repository and return a malicious payload.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Ability to compromise a server hosting a Maven repository.
    *   Ability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack on a network path between the Maven client and repository server.

**3. Mitigation:**

*   Apache Maven 3.8.1 and later versions have changed the default behavior to block HTTP repository references, mitigating this vulnerability.
*  Using a repository manager to govern repositories used by builds makes a system unaffected by this vulnerability and the change to default behavior.

**4. Credit:**

*  Jonathan Leitschuh was credited for highlighting the need for the change.

**5. Additional Information:**

* The content provides more details about the rationale behind the change, which is based on the potential risks of using non-SSL repositories.
* The content provides mitigation information suggesting users should upgrade their maven version or use repository managers which are unaffected by the vulnerability.
