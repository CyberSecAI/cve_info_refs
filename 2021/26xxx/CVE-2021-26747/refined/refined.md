Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2021-26747:

The provided content includes a link to a GitHub repository named `netis-route` which contains a Python script named `NetisRcommandinject.py`. This script's name suggests a potential command injection vulnerability related to Netis routers. While the CVE description is not available, the script's filename strongly indicates that the content is relevant to a command injection vulnerability in Netis routers.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause appears to be a command injection vulnerability, likely present in the web interface or firmware of Netis routers.
* The python script `NetisRcommandinject.py` implies the vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary system commands on the router's operating system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of a command injection vulnerability. This allows an attacker to execute commands on the underlying operating system of the router by injecting malicious input into a vulnerable field.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router's system.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** This can lead to a full compromise of the router, enabling the attacker to perform various malicious actions.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive information stored on the router or connected network.
*   **Malware Installation:** The attacker could install malware, establishing a persistent foothold.
*   **Botnet Recruitment:** The compromised router could be used as part of a botnet.
*  **Denial of Service:** The router could be made unstable and deny service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The most likely attack vector is through the router's web-based management interface.
*   **Unsanitized Input:** The vulnerability probably stems from unsanitized user input within the web interface that is later used in a system command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Netis router. This could be on the local network or from the internet if the router's management interface is exposed.
*  **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** Attacker would need to know which parameter is vulnerable in order to craft their exploit.
*   **Technical Skills:** The attacker would need sufficient technical skills to craft the command injection payload and execute the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
* The presence of a dedicated script `NetisRcommandinject.py` implies that this is a known and potentially easy to exploit vulnerability.

This analysis provides more detail than what would be expected from a typical CVE description, given that it's based on the associated code and filenames.
