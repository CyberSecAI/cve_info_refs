- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the `SetFeatureEnabled.jspa` resource.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application fails to properly validate the origin of requests to the `SetFeatureEnabled.jspa` resource, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of legitimate users without their consent.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote anonymous attackers can enable or disable Jira Software configurations.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can craft a malicious web page or email containing a crafted request to the vulnerable `SetFeatureEnabled.jspa` resource. If a logged-in user visits the malicious content, their browser will send the request to the Jira server, triggering the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious web page or clicking a malicious link to trigger the crafted request.
