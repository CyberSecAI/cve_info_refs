Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-26930:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the Xen block backend driver (`xen-blkback`) within the Linux kernel. The driver uses a loop to map grant references provided by the frontend. The root cause is improper error handling during this mapping process. Specifically:
   - An error encountered during grant mapping could be discarded during later iterations of the loop, leading to the caller assuming successful mapping when it actually failed.
   - The internal state was insufficiently updated when an out-of-memory error occurred, preventing safe recovery.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Improper Error Handling:** The core issue is the lack of proper error checking and handling within the `xen_blkbk_map()` function. An earlier mapping error can be overwritten by subsequent operations, leaving the system in an inconsistent state.
-   **Incomplete State Updates:**  The out-of-memory error path failed to properly initialize all relevant structure fields before inspecting the handle, leading to further issues in subsequent operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious or faulty frontend driver can exploit this to crash the corresponding backend driver. In scenarios without driver domains (common for many setups), this translates to a host-wide DoS.
-   **Potential Privilege Escalation and Information Leak:** While not definitively proven, privilege escalation and information leaks are possible outcomes, due to the incorrect mapping, and thus memory corruption, in Dom0.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious Guest Driver:** The primary attack vector involves a malicious or buggy frontend driver within a guest VM that is able to interact with the blkback driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Guest VM Access:** An attacker needs control over a guest VM with the ability to send requests to the blkback driver.
-   **Knowledge of Grant Mapping:** An attacker needs some understanding of the grant mapping process.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions 3.11 and later.
-   The fix involves ensuring the proper loop exits when a grant mapping error occurs and that the required fields are correctly initialized in error handling paths.
-   The fix involves using `goto` statements to handle error conditions by jumping to a shared `out` label.
-   The NetApp advisory indicates that some of their products using the Linux kernel are affected but also indicates that some specific products will not be patched and have an end of life (EOA).
