- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SeedDMS application lacks proper CSRF protection in the `out.EditFolder.php` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to edit a victim's documents by tricking them into submitting a crafted request.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker hosts a malicious HTML page on their server and sends the link to the victim. When the victim opens the page in their browser (while being authenticated to the target SeedDMS instance) the malicious code within the HTML page triggers the crafted request which is then executed against the SeedDMS instance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host a malicious HTML page and lure an authenticated user to open this page in their browser.
