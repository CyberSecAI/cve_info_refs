{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists within the User Profile Service due to improper handling of directory junctions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The User Profile Service can be abused by creating a directory junction, allowing an attacker to create a second junction in a sensitive location.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local attack vector.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system."
