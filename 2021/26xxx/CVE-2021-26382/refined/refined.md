Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-26382:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Audio Co-Processor (ACP) firmware loading process. Specifically, it stems from the lack of proper checks on whether a signing key is actually usable for authenticating an ACP firmware image.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Improper authorization control that allows loading of any legitimately signed firmware into the Audio Co-Processor.
-  The system fails to verify if the signing key of the firmware being loaded is declared as valid for authenticating ACP firmware.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can load arbitrary, legitimately signed firmware into the ACP. This can lead to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker with root account privileges can exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to load a specially crafted, but legitimately signed firmware image into the ACP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have root account privileges on the system.
- The attacker requires a legitimately signed firmware image for the ACP.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is rated as low severity.
- The affected products are AMD Ryzen™ 5000 Series Mobile Processors with Radeon™ Graphics ("Cezanne" and "Lucienne" ) and AMD Ryzen™ 4000 Series Mobile Processor with Radeon™ Graphics ("Renoir" FP6)
- The vulnerability is mitigated by updating to the AGESA™ PI software version indicated in the document.
