Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-26933:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the way Xen handles cache cleaning on ARM architectures after scrubbing memory pages. Specifically, the cache cleaning operation happens *before* a check to confirm if the page was actually scrubbed. This sequence creates a race condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Inadequate Cache Management:** The core issue is that the cache isn't reliably cleaned after a memory scrub operation before the page is given to a guest. This could lead to stale data being present.
- **Race Condition:** The order of operations (cache clean, then check for scrubbing) introduces a race where a write during scrubbing may not have reached memory before a guest gets access to the page.
- **Missing Write Guarantee:** Xen fails to guarantee that all writes (specifically, those from scrubbing) are flushed to memory before the memory is given to the guest.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A malicious guest could potentially read sensitive data that was present in the memory page before it was scrubbed. This data might have belonged to a previous guest or another part of the system, leading to data leakage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Guest:** The attack vector is a malicious guest OS running within the Xen hypervisor.
- **Memory Access:** The vulnerability is exploited through memory access patterns on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Guest OS Control:** The attacker must have control over a guest operating system running on the vulnerable Xen hypervisor.
- **ARM Architecture:** The system must be running on ARM architecture, as this vulnerability is specific to the ARM implementation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Xen versions 4.9 onwards.
- There was no known mitigation besides applying the patch
- The fix involves ensuring the cache cleaning occurs *after* verification that the scrub has completed.
