Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-26549:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the AdminTool console of SmartFoxServer. Specifically, HTML code entered into the console is not adequately sanitized before being displayed back to the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an authenticated Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The vulnerability is triggered due to inadequate input sanitization in the AdminTool console's handling of user-provided data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary HTML Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary HTML code within the context of a user's browser session when they are logged into the affected SmartFoxServer instance. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking via malicious script injection.
    *   Stealing of cookies and potentially other sensitive data.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacement of the administration panel.
    *   Other actions that an attacker might leverage within the userâ€™s session.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **WebSocket:** The attack vector involves crafting malicious input that is sent to the server's console module via a WebSocket connection. This suggests a direct interaction with a websocket endpoint is necessary to deliver the malicious payload.
*   **AdminTool Console:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user inputs a payload into the AdminTool console.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the SmartFoxServer admin panel and specifically the console feature.
*   **Access to WebSocket:** The attacker must be able to interact with the websocket endpoint used by the admin console.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to reach the SmartFoxServer instance.

**Technical Details:**
*   The code snippet `/ConsoleModuleReqHandler.java` reveals that the sanitization is inadequate, as it only replaces `<` and `>` with `&lt;` and `&gt;`, but does not prevent `<script>` or other potentially malicious HTML tags.
*   The provided PoC shows how a WebSocket payload can be crafted to inject a simple JavaScript confirmation dialog:
    ```
    WebSocket payload:
    \x80\x00\x52\x12\x00\x03\x00\x01\x63\x02\x01\x00
    \x01\x61\x03\x00\x0D\x00\x01\x70\x12\x00\x03\x00
    \x01\x63\x08\x00\x0C\x63\x6F\x6E\x73\x6F\x6C\x65
    \x2E\x68\x69\x6E\x74\x00\x01\x72\x04\xFF\xFF\xFF
    \xFF\x00\x01\x70\x12\x00\x01\x00\x01\x63\x08\x00
    \x18\x3C\x73\x63\x72\x69\x70\x74\x3E\x63\x6F\x6E
    \x66\x69\x72\x6D\x28\x64\x6F\x63\x75\x6D\x65\x6E
    \x74\x2E\x55\x52\x4C\x29
    ```
    This payload, when sent to the console, will cause the injected javascript `confirm(document.URL)` to execute.

**Affected Versions:**
*   SmartFoxServer 2X version 2.17.0
*   Remote Admin version 3.2.6.
*   The vulnerability affects SmartFoxServer 2X, Pro and Basic editions.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Gjoko 'LiquidWorm' Krstic of Zero Science Lab.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.4 (Medium).
