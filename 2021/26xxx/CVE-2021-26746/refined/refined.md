Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26746:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the Chamilo LMS platform. It stems from the `type` parameter in the `agenda_list.php` file not being properly sanitized before being used in a URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The `type` parameter from the GET request is directly used to build a URL within the application. Specifically, in the `agenda_list.php` file.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the `type` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the vulnerable parameter.
- **Session Hijacking:** Exploitation could lead to session hijacking, where an attacker steals a user's session cookie and impersonates the user.
- **Data Theft:** An attacker could potentially steal sensitive information by running malicious JavaScript.
- **Malicious Redirects:** The attacker could redirect users to phishing sites or other malicious locations.
- **Website Defacement:** The attacker could modify the content of the web page, causing defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **GET Request Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted GET request to `agenda_list.php` with a malicious payload in the `type` parameter.
- **User Interaction:** An attacker would likely need to entice a user to click on a specially crafted link containing the malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTTP requests, URL parameters, and JavaScript.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable server.
- **Social Engineering (Likely):** The attacker needs to convince users to click on the crafted URL to execute the malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The specific attack pattern used is: `x%22+onmouseover%3dnetsparker(0x01CE61)+x%3d%22`
- The vulnerable URL is: `http://alihost/chamilo/main/calendar/agenda_list.php?type=x"%20onmouseover=netsparker(0x01CE61)%20x="#collapse-personal_1`
- The vulnerability was present in Chamilo LMS version 1.11.14.
- The vulnerability has been fixed by sanitizing the `type` parameter using `Security::remove_XSS()`.
