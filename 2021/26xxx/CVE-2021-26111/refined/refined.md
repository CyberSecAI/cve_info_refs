Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-26111:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A memory leak vulnerability exists in the `lldpmedd` daemon of FortiSwitch. This occurs due to a missing memory release after the effective lifetime of certain data structures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary weakness is a memory leak. The `lldpmedd` daemon doesn't properly release allocated memory, which leads to memory exhaustion over time.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit the memory leak to exhaust the available memory on the FortiSwitch device. This leads to a denial of service, rendering the switch unresponsive or unstable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Adjacent Network:** The attacker needs to be present on an adjacent network to send the malicious packets.
- **LLDP/CDP/EDP Packets:** The attack involves sending specifically crafted LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol), CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol), or EDP (Extreme Discovery Protocol) packets to the vulnerable FortiSwitch.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be on a network adjacent to the FortiSwitch.
-   The attacker needs the ability to craft and send network packets, specifically LLDP/CDP/EDP packets.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in FortiSwitch versions 6.4.6 and below, 6.2.6 and below, 6.0.x, and 3.6.x.
-  The vendor recommends upgrading to FortiSwitch 7.0.0, 6.4.7 or above, or 6.2.7 or above to resolve the vulnerability.
-   The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity with a CVSSv3 score of 6.2.
