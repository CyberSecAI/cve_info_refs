Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-26937

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of certain UTF-8 character sequences within the `encoding.c` file of GNU Screen. Specifically, when processing combining characters, the code accesses an array (`combchars`) using an index (`i`) that can go out of bounds. This leads to a crash due to an invalid memory access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write attempt. The code attempts to allocate and initialize a `combchar` structure at an invalid index in the `combchars` array. This occurs when the index 'i' is out of range.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate and most likely impact is a denial of service. The out-of-bounds write causes the `screen` process to crash.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability has the potential for arbitrary code execution, although this is less certain. The provided information suggests this is a possibility but doesn't go into detail on how this could be achieved.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted UTF-8 Sequences:** The attack vector involves providing a crafted UTF-8 character sequence as input to `screen`. This input is specifically designed to trigger the out-of-bounds write in `encoding.c`.
- **Log Files:** The exploit can be triggered by injecting the crafted sequences into log files being tailed by a screen session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Control of Input:** The attacker needs to have control over the input stream that is processed by `screen`. This could be achieved through:
    - Writing to logfiles being tailed within screen
    - Injecting the malicious UTF-8 sequence into other program outputs being displayed in a screen session.
    - Providing the malicious input directly to screen if it is accepting standard input.
- **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not require special privileges, the vulnerability can be triggered by normal users.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was initially reported on the `screen-devel` mailing list, which was not intended for public viewing at the time.
- Patches have been released to address the vulnerability, and the affected packages were updated in various distributions (Fedora, Debian, Gentoo).
- The vulnerability is present in GNU Screen versions up to and including 4.8.0.

In summary, CVE-2021-26937 is a vulnerability in GNU Screen where a specially crafted UTF-8 sequence can cause a crash due to an out-of-bounds access in the character processing routines, potentially leading to denial of service and possibly code execution.
