Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26720:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The content from multiple sources, including the NVD entry, Ubuntu security tracker, SUSE bug reports, and mailing list discussions, clearly relates to CVE-2021-26720. It consistently refers to a vulnerability in the `avahi-daemon-check-dns.sh` script within the Debian avahi package, which is a core component of this CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

   *   **Root Cause:**
        - The vulnerability stems from the fact that the script `avahi-daemon-check-dns.sh` was executed with root privileges via `/etc/network/if-up.d/avahi-daemon`.
        - The script followed symlinks in `/run/avahi-daemon/disabled-for-unicast-local` and  `/run/avahi-daemon/checked_nameservers.<PID>` which are owned by the unprivileged `avahi` user.
   *   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
        - **Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') (CWE-59):** The script follows symbolic links in directories owned by an unprivileged user, leading to a vulnerability.
        -  **Privilege Escalation:**  Due to the script being executed by root, an attacker can manipulate the script's behavior.
   *   **Impact of Exploitation:**
        - **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files, causing a denial of service.
        - **Arbitrary File Creation/Modification:** An attacker can create arbitrary empty files or update timestamps of existing files, by creating symlinks in directories owned by the `avahi` user.
        - **Privilege Escalation:** The ability to create and modify files in specific locations with elevated privileges can further lead to privilege escalation attacks.
   *   **Attack Vectors:**
        - Local attack.
        - By manipulating symbolic links in specific directories, the attacker can force the root process to interact with attacker controlled files and locations.
   *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
        - Local user access with the ability to manipulate symlinks in the `/run/avahi-daemon` directory, which is owned by the `avahi` user.

**Additional Technical Details and Descriptions**

*   **Script's Purpose:** The `avahi-daemon-check-dns.sh` script was used in older Debian systems to disable Avahi when a .local domain was detected on unicast DNS servers, but this is now handled by `libnss-mdns`.
*   **SUSE Specifics:** SUSE distributions also shipped a vulnerable, outdated copy of the script that was vulnerable until patched.
*  **Debian's Response**: Debian maintainers removed the vulnerable script in newer releases
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability was mitigated by either removing the vulnerable script, or dropping privileges to the `avahi` user before running the script to prevent it from causing damage when run as root.
*   **Affected Versions:** Debian versions of avahi up to 0.8-4 and SUSE distributions using the vulnerable script copy.
*  **CVSS Score**: The vulnerability received a CVSS v3 score of 7.8 (High).

**Summary of Impact:**

CVE-2021-26720 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the avahi package, specifically in a Debian-specific script. A local attacker, by manipulating symlinks in a directory owned by the `avahi` user, can cause a denial-of-service or create/modify arbitrary files when the script executes as root. The main mitigation was to either drop privileges when executing the script or completely remove it.
