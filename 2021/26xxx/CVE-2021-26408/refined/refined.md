- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of elliptic curve points in SEV-legacy firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Improper input validation in the SEV-legacy firmware related to elliptic curve points.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could compromise SEV-legacy guest migration, potentially leading to loss of guest's integrity or confidentiality.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is related to the SEV-legacy guest migration process, which suggests the attacker would likely be in a position to trigger a guest migration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be in a position to trigger a guest migration using the SEV-legacy firmware. This likely implies a hypervisor or management plane position with some level of control or influence over the target system.
