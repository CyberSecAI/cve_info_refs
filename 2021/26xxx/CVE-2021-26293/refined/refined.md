The content is related to CVE-2021-26293.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the built-in DAV server used in WebMail Pro and Aurora Corporate. It allows uploading and executing arbitrary files due to insufficient input validation when processing requests. Specifically, the vulnerability is related to path traversal and authentication bypass issues within the DAV server's handling of requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **Path Traversal:** The `exec()` function in `vendor/afterlogic/dav/lib/DAVServer.php` (for versions 8.5.3 and later) and `libraries/afterlogic/DAV/Server.php` (for older versions) lacks proper validation of the request URI, allowing attackers to potentially traverse directories using `../` sequences.
2.  **Authentication Bypass:** The `validateUserPass` function in `vendor/afterlogic/dav/lib/DAV/Auth/Backend/Basic.php` and `libraries/afterlogic/DAV/Auth/Backend/Basic.php`, as well as the `getDigestHash` function in `vendor/afterlogic/dav/lib/DAV/Auth/Backend/Digest.php` and `libraries/afterlogic/DAV/Auth/Backend/Digest.php` failed to restrict access to the DAV_PUBLIC_PRINCIPAL and DAV_TENANT_PRINCIPAL, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to:
*   Complete compromise of the webmail server.
*   Data breaches and unauthorized access to emails and other sensitive information.
*   Malware distribution to other users via the compromised server.
*   Denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploitable via HTTP requests to the DAV server.
*   An attacker can use crafted request URIs containing path traversal sequences (`../`) to upload malicious files outside of the intended directory.
*   Bypassing authentication by using the public or tenant principal, then using the DAV server to upload and execute arbitrary files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WebMail Pro or Aurora Corporate installation.
*   No specific user privileges are needed to exploit the authentication bypass.
*   The attacker should be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
