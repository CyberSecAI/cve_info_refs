### CVE-2021-26473

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the HTTP API endpoint `/sgwebservice_o.php` with the `Action=logFilePath` parameter, which allows an attacker to write arbitrary files to the web server's file system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated arbitrary file upload: The API does not require authentication, allowing anyone to upload files.
- Command execution: Uploaded files can be executed by accessing them via the web server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Complete system takeover: By uploading and executing malicious files, an attacker can gain full control over the vulnerable Vembu BDR system.
- Data access: Attackers can access data stored within the backup system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote exploitation: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network using HTTP requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable Vembu BDR system. No authentication is required.

**Additional Information**
- Affected Products: VembuBDR and VembuOffsiteDR before version 4.2.0.1
- The vulnerability was discovered during a pentest by a DIVD researcher.
- The vulnerability is part of a set of four critical vulnerabilities discovered in Vembu BDR Suite.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 9.8.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Vembu BDR version 4.2.0 update 2.
