{
  "CVE-2021-26931": {
    "Root cause": "The Xen block, net, and SCSI backend drivers incorrectly handle grant mapping errors, treating them as bugs and causing a kernel crash, instead of gracefully handling them.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect error handling in Xen backend drivers.",
      "Use of BUG() for non-bug conditions.",
      "Lack of proper consideration for out-of-memory conditions"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious guest can cause a denial-of-service (crash) in the backend domain (typically dom0), potentially affecting the entire system or other guests.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious guest triggering errors in the grant mapping process of the block, net, or SCSI backend drivers.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A malicious or buggy guest with the ability to interact with the affected backend drivers."
  }
