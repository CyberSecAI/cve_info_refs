Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26900:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error within the `CInteractionTrackerMarshaler` component of DirectComposition in Microsoft Windows.
*   The core issue is the lack of proper validation of an object's existence before performing operations on it. This can lead to the use of a freed object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free condition, where the program attempts to access memory that has already been freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a local attacker to escalate their privileges.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. This effectively gives the attacker full control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must be able to execute code on the target system with low privileges.
*   **DirectComposition:** The vulnerability lies within the DirectComposition component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Code Execution:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the targeted Windows system.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft on 2020-12-04
