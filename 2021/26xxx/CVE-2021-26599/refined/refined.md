Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `/include/findusers.php` script of ImpressCMS.
*   The `groups` POST parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.
*   Specifically, the `icms_member_Handler::getUserCountByGroupLink()` and `icms_member_Handler::getUsersByGroupLink()` methods use this unsanitized input to construct SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The lack of proper input sanitization allows for SQL injection attacks.
*   **Boolean-based SQL Injection:**  Attackers can use boolean-based SQL injection to extract sensitive data.
*   **Stacked SQL Queries:** The application allows stacked queries, increasing the impact of the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** Attackers can read sensitive data from the "users" database table.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The ability to execute stacked queries allows for more severe impacts such as:
    *   Creating a new admin user.
    *   Executing arbitrary PHP code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted POST request with malicious SQL code in the `groups` parameter to the `findusers.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable ImpressCMS instance.
*   **No Authentication:** It is not explicitly stated whether authentication is required, but based on the vulnerability description it would likely be exploitable by anyone who could access the page including unauthenticated users.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability was not correctly fixed in version 1.4.3, and required a subsequent patch in version 1.4.4.
