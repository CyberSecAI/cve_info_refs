CVE-2021-26356:
  - Root cause: A Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability exists in the AMD Secure Processor (ASP) bootloader.
  - Weaknesses: The vulnerability arises from a race condition where the SPI ROM data is read into memory, and then the SPI ROM can be tampered with before the data is used by the bootloader.
  - Impact: Exploitation could lead to System S3 data corruption, potentially leading to information disclosure.
  - Attack vectors: An attacker can tamper with the SPI ROM following the data read to memory, exploiting the TOCTOU condition.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: Attacker needs to be able to manipulate the SPI ROM after the data read.
