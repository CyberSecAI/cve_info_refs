Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2021-26835.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insecure handling of iFrames within the Zettlr application. Specifically, the application was vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks through malicious iFrame embeds, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure iFrame handling.
- Lack of sanitization or filtering of iFrame attributes, specifically the `srcdoc` attribute.
- Absence of a whitelist for allowed iFrame hostnames.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the user's machine.
- Attackers could take over users' computers using specially crafted iFrame-embed codes or Markdown documents containing such an iFrame.
- The provided example in the issue report shows that a malicious actor can execute `calc.exe` through the vulnerable iFrame injection within a markdown file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted .md files containing malicious iFrame code.
- iFrame embeds with the `srcdoc` attribute.
- Markdown documents with malicious iFrame embeds.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create a malicious .md file or craft malicious iFrame code.
- Ability to convince a user to open a malicious .md file with the vulnerable version of Zettlr.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was fixed by:
1. Omitting all iFrame attributes except `src` during rendering in the application, blocking the use of `srcdoc`.
2. Implementing a global whitelist of allowed iFrame hostnames (initially only YouTube and Vimeo).
3. Blocking the rendering of iFrames from non-whitelisted hostnames by default and providing a warning prompt to the user to either render it once or permanently whitelist it.
4. Option to completely disable iFrame pre-rendering

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was reported by the Japanese cybersecurity organization JPCERT.
- The developers published a postmortem of this incident on their blog.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Zettlr version 1.8.9.
