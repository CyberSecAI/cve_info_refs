| Thanks so much for opening up your first issue here on the repository! üéâ We would like to warmly welcome you to the community behind the app! ‚ò∫Ô∏è We'll check in soon and have a look at your issue. In the meantime, you can check your issue and make sure it aligns with our contribution guidelines! Here's the comprehensive list: Enhancements An enhancement takes a feature and improves or alters its behaviour. Please make sure to argue how your proposition will aid non-technical text workers, and why it can't be emulated easily with other features or apps! Feature requests Feature requests introduce whole new features into the app. This requires a lot of work, so these might be turned down if the implementation costs supersede the benefits we expect to see from implementing it. Please do not be disappointed if that happens. It likely has nothing to do with your great request but simply with us and our missing resources! You can of course always ask someone to implement this feature, because a PR with a working new feature has much higher chances of being merged! :) Bug reports Please note that one of the main reasons for why bug reports cannot be addressed is that there's not enough information for us to find and fix the bug you describe, so make sure you try to pinpoint the bug as close as possible. The ideal bug report for us has two qualities:   1. The bug is always reproducible, at least within a certain context. 2. We know exactly what specifically goes wrong, and there is consensus on    what should happen instead.   Please note that if you encounter behaviour that does not align with your expectations of what would happen, this might as well be simply intended behaviour and we need to simply *clarify* why the behaviour is the way it is. This is not to be considered a bug and such issues may be closed! Suggest an enhancement instead! But now, have a great day and thank you again! |

| Absolutely true, Abricotine worked around this using a whitelist of pages. I have to implement something similar. |

# HOTFIX FOR JVN#98239374 | Update Immediately!

> Read our [Postmortem](https://zettlr.com/post/postmortem-zettlr-first-security-incident) on this issue and the last one on our blog.

This is a hotfix that fixes a potentially severe security-issue, reported to us by the Japanese cybersecurity organisation JPCERT. It was reported that due to insecure iFrame handling on our side, malicious actors could take over users' computers using specially crafted iFrame-embed codes or Markdown-documents containing such an iFrame.

This release closes this vulnerability. Specifically, the following precautions were taken:

1. Now, whenever Zettlr renders an iFrame, it will omit all attributes except `src` -- in the security disclosure, the attribute `srcdoc` has been used to maliciously access the test system. While this means that certain features are not supported during preview (e.g., `allowfullscreen`), remember that the attributes will still be exported so that in HTML exports, they will work.
2. We have added a global whitelist that by default only contains the hostnames of YouTube and Vimeo players so that those embeds work out of the box. For all other hostnames, rendering of iFrames will be blocked by default. Instead, you will be presented with a warning and be asked whether or not you want to render content from the given hostname. You can then choose to render it *once*, or permanently add the named hostname to the whitelist.

> Note that you can completely disable any iFrame pre-rendering in your display preferences.

We would like to apologise for the inconvenience. If you are interested in how it came to this situation, please [read our Postmortem](https://zettlr.com/post/postmortem-zettlr-first-security-incident) on this issue.
