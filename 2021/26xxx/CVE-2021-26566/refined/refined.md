Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26566:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insertion of sensitive information into data sent by `synorelayd`, specifically within the inbound QuickConnect traffic. This process of including sensitive data in transit creates an exploitable condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Information Leakage:** Sensitive data is being included in the outbound data stream, making it vulnerable to interception.
-   **Insertion of Sensitive Information:** The core issue lies in how `synorelayd` processes and includes sensitive data when handling QuickConnect connections. This allows attackers to inject commands by manipulating this information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful attack can allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM).

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** The attacker needs to intercept network traffic between the client and the Synology server to exploit this vulnerability.
-   **QuickConnect Traffic:** The attack is specifically related to inbound traffic coming from QuickConnect connections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be in a position to perform a MitM attack, meaning they need to be able to intercept network traffic between the client (user) and the Synology QuickConnect server.
-   **Knowledge of QuickConnect:** An attacker needs to be aware of how QuickConnect is used to redirect traffic and how the system interacts with QuickConnect to leverage the insertion of sensitive data.
-   **Targeted User Interaction:** The victim needs to use the QuickConnect service, thus generating the vulnerable traffic for the attacker to exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `synorelayd` component of the Synology DSM.
- The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS v3 score of 8.3, which indicates a high severity.
- The vulnerability is fixed in DSM version 6.2.3-25426-3 and later.
- This vulnerability, when exploited together with TALOS-2020-1059 (likely related to HTTP redirection to unencrypted channel), could allow an attacker to get a valid cookie, which enhances the exploitability of CVE-2021-26566.
