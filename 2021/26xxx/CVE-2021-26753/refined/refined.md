Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26753:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is due to improper control of code generation. Specifically, the NeDi application allows authenticated users to inject PHP code into a system file via the `txt` POST parameter in the `/System-Files.php` endpoint. This allows for the execution of arbitrary PHP code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Code Injection (CWE-94):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code. The application fails to sanitize or validate the input provided through the `txt` parameter when editing system files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
- **Full System Compromise:** By executing arbitrary code, an attacker gains the same privileges as the web server process, potentially leading to complete control of the server, including access to all application data and the underlying operating system.
- **Data Breach:** This vulnerability can be exploited to access, modify, or delete data stored within the application's database.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious POST request to the `/System-Files.php` endpoint, including PHP code within the `txt` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid credentials to access the NeDi web interface.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the NeDi application.
- **Understanding of PHP:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of PHP to craft an effective payload.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content has a very detailed explanation and proof-of-concept of the exploit.
- The vulnerability is located in the file editing functionality (`System-Files.php`).
- The exploit bypasses a direct execution prevention mechanism by adding the injected code at the beginning of the file.
- The article also shows a scenario where it is possible to obtain a reverse shell by injecting a malicious perl script.
- The advisory details the responsible disclosure process and the vendor's prompt response to patch the issue.
