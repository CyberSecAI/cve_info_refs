Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-26324:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is related to a bug in the SEV-ES TMR (Trusted Memory Region) implementation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The SEV-ES TMR implementation has a flaw that can lead to potential memory integrity loss for SNP-active VMs (Secure Nested Paging Virtual Machines).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Exploitation can result in a potential loss of memory integrity for SNP-active virtual machines.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability affects SEV-ES TMR, which suggests that the attacker needs some level of access to the virtualized environment where SEV-ES is being used. The content does not explicitly state the required level of access but it is likely local access within the VM.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the capability to interact with the SEV-ES TMR (Trusted Memory Region). This would likely require some level of access to the system running the virtual machine. It is noted that the memory integrity loss affects SNP-active VMs.

**Additional Notes**
*  The provided document includes a list of other CVEs fixed in the same patch along with their individual details, impacts, and base scores.
*  The fix involves updating the AGESA firmware on the affected AMD EPYC processors.
* The vulnerability was reported by Google.
