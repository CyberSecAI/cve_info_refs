Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26544:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in the Apache Livy server, specifically affecting how session names are handled in the user interface. The session name was not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious HTML or JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization for session names. The application displayed user-supplied session names without proper escaping, which is necessary to prevent the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Access to other users' data:** A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability to access logs and results of other users' sessions. This could lead to information disclosure.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker could run jobs with the privileges of other users. By injecting malicious scripts, the attacker can potentially perform actions they are not authorized to do.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker would inject malicious code into the session name when creating a session. When other users view the list of sessions, this malicious code will be executed in their browsers, allowing the attacker to perform unauthorized actions.
- This is a stored XSS vulnerability because the malicious payload is stored in the application's data (the session name).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to create a session with a malicious session name in the vulnerable version of Apache Livy (0.7.0-incubating)

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.7.1-incubating of Apache Livy.
- The provided patch on GitHub shows that HTML escaping has been added to the session name display in the web UI, preventing the execution of injected scripts.
- Specifically, the fix adds the `escapeHtml` function to sanitize the session name before it is displayed.
