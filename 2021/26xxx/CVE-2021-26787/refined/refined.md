Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper sanitization of user-supplied input within the Genesys Workforce Management application. Specifically, the application fails to properly encode or sanitize user-provided data before using it in the context of deleting entries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application is susceptible to reflected XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session. This could lead to:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Defacing the application interface.
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a malicious payload being injected into fields like Holiday requests. When a user attempts to delete the crafted entry, the application renders the payload, triggering the XSS. The payload identified was  `<video src=1 onerror=alert(1)>`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to input the malicious payload into fields within the "Policies > Time-Off Types" or similar vulnerable sections of the Genesys Workforce Management application.
    - The attacker's payload must be triggered by a specific action such as deleting the crafted entry.
