  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `edit_user.php` file is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input being directly used in a SQL query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection vulnerability in the `id` parameter of `edit_user.php`.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially manipulate the database, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information, modifying data, or potentially taking control of the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting malicious SQL queries within the `id` parameter when accessing `edit_user.php`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable `edit_user.php` with a modified `id` parameter."
