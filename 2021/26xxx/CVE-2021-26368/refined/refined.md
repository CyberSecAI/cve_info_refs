Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-26368:

**CVE-2021-26368**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient check of the process type in the Trusted OS (TOS).
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper verification of process privileges within the Trusted OS.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with sufficient privileges can exploit this flaw to enable a lower-privileged process to unmap memory owned by a higher-privileged process. This leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker needs to have some level of elevated privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must have gained some level of privilege in the system to execute the attack.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is caused by the Trusted OS failing to properly check the privilege level of processes, which could be exploited to cause a denial of service.
