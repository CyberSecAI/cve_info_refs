- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Deserialization of untrusted data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Apache ShardingSphere-UI is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data. This allows an attacker to inject outer link resources.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject outer link resources. The message does not specify the specific impact of this injection.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing untrusted data that is then deserialized. The specific method of providing this data is not mentioned, other than it happens through ShardingSphere-UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the ShardingSphere-UI to provide the malicious data.

The message provides more information than the CVE description by specifying that the vulnerability involves injecting outer link resources through deserialization. It also mentions that the issue affects versions 4.1.1 and later but not versions equal or greater than 5.0.0
