    "root_cause": "The persistent platform private key may not be protected with a random IV.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The lack of a random Initialization Vector (IV) when protecting a persistent platform private key can lead to a vulnerability.",
       "This can enable a 'two-time pad attack' if the same key is used to encrypt data with the same IV."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploitation could compromise the security of the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "This is likely a local attack given the description of platform private key, which indicates the need for local access to the system where the vulnerability exists."

      "An attacker would likely need to have some level of access to the system where the key is stored."
