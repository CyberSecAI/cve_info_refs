- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing token check in the AJAX reordering endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially manipulate the order of items via an AJAX request without the victim's knowledge or consent. This may lead to disruption of website content, modification of information presentation, or other unintended consequences. The impact is considered low.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack is carried out through a CSRF attack, where a malicious website or email can trick an authenticated user into making an unintended request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into visiting a malicious webpage or clicking a malicious link, and knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint to perform a crafted request.
