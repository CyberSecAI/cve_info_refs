Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper permission control in the Wi-Fi module interface, which exposes sensitive device information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient access control:** The Wi-Fi module's interface lacks proper permission checks, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
*   **Information Leakage:** The vulnerability leads to the leakage of sensitive device information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality breach:** Exploitation results in the leakage of sensitive device information.
*   **No Integrity or Availability impact:**  The vulnerability does not affect data integrity or the availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local access:** The attack vector is local, indicated by "AV:L".
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required, indicated by "UI:R".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the device.
*   **User interaction:** The attacker must trick or convince a user to interact with the system in a specific way to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **No privileges required:** No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability, indicated by "PR:N".

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Devices using Android versions earlier than Android 10 are affected.
*   **Fixed Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in Android 11 and later.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.3 (Medium), with the vector string (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N), indicating Local access, low attack complexity, no privileges required, user interaction required, scope changed, high confidentiality impact, no integrity or availability impact.
