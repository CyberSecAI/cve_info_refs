Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described:

**Vulnerability 1: SQL Injection in `edit-sub.php` via `sid` parameter**

*   **Root cause:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization of the `sid` parameter in the `edit-sub.php` file.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Unsanitized user input in the `sid` parameter directly used in an SQL query.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Data exfiltration (retrieving sensitive information from the database).
    *   Data modification (altering or deleting data).
    *   Privilege escalation (gaining higher access levels).
    *   Denial of service (making the application unusable).
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to `edit-sub.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `sid` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application and have knowledge of SQL.

**Vulnerability 2: SQL Injection in `edit-course.php` via `cid` parameter**

*   **Root cause:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization of the `cid` parameter in the `edit-course.php` file.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Unsanitized user input in the `cid` parameter directly used in an SQL query.
*    **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Data exfiltration (retrieving sensitive information from the database).
    *   Data modification (altering or deleting data).
    *   Privilege escalation (gaining higher access levels).
    *   Denial of service (making the application unusable).
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to `edit-course.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `cid` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application and have knowledge of SQL.

**Vulnerability 3: SQL Injection in `edit-std.php` via `id` parameter**

*   **Root cause:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization of the `id` parameter in the `edit-std.php` file.
*  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter directly used in an SQL query.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Data exfiltration (retrieving sensitive information from the database).
    *   Data modification (altering or deleting data).
    *   Privilege escalation (gaining higher access levels).
    *   Denial of service (making the application unusable).
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to `edit-std.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `id` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application and have knowledge of SQL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes specific SQL injection payloads using `SLEEP(5)` for demonstrating the vulnerability. This can be used to verify the vulnerability by observing a delay in the server response.
*   The content suggests using `sqlmap` to exploit these vulnerabilities, which is a common tool for automated SQL injection exploitation.
*   The vulnerable software is "Student Record System 4.0", available at the provided link on phpgurukul.com.
