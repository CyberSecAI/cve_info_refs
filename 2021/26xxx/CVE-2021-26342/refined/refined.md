- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The CPU may fail to flush the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) following a specific sequence of operations, including the creation of a new virtual machine control block (VMCB).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stale TLB translations due to the failure to flush the TLB after VMCB creation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: This can lead to the disclosure of SEV guest memory contents, as the stale translations may allow access to incorrect memory locations.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered within SEV guest VMs during the creation of a new VMCB with a particular sequence of operations that causes the TLB flush to fail.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to have the ability to perform the specific sequence of operations within a SEV guest VM that triggers the TLB flush failure.
