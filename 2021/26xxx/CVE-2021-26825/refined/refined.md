Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26825:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `ImageLoaderTGA::load_image()` function when calculating the buffer size required to store an image. This occurs due to the multiplication of `tga_header.image_width`, `tga_header.image_height`, and `pixel_size`. If these values are large enough, the result can wrap around, leading to a smaller-than-required buffer allocation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The multiplication to calculate the `buffer_size` can overflow, leading to an incorrect (smaller) size.
- **Dynamic stack buffer overflow:**  The undersized buffer leads to a heap-based buffer overflow during image loading when data is written to the smaller-than-required buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Code execution:**  Depending on the context of the application, a specially crafted TGA file could lead to code execution.
- **System crash:** The buffer overflow can cause the application to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious TGA files:** The vulnerability is triggered by loading specially crafted TGA image files with large `image_width`, `image_height`, and/or `pixel_size` values designed to cause an integer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a crafted TGA file to the application using the vulnerable `ImageLoaderTGA` class. Depending on the application, this may be done locally or remotely.
- The attacker must have the ability to have the vulnerable application load the crafted TGA file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Godot Engine 3.2 (and later versions) through the pull request [godotengine/godot#45702](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/45702). This fix involved adding a check to ensure the size of the buffer is correct.
- The vulnerability is also referenced in a Gentoo commit that also provides details on the root cause and impact.
