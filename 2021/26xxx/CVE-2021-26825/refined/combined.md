## Description

An integer overflow issue exists in Godot Engine up to v3.2 that can be triggered when loading specially crafted.TGA image files. The vulnerability exists in ImageLoaderTGA::load\_image() function at line: const size\_t buffer\_size = (tga\_header.image\_width \* tga\_header.image\_height) \* pixel\_size; The bug leads to Dynamic stack buffer overflow. Depending on the context of the application, attack vector can be local or remote, and can lead to code execution and/or system crash.

An integer overflow issue exists in Godot Engine up to v3.2 that can
be triggered when loading specially crafted.TGA image files. The
vulnerability exists in ImageLoaderTGA::load_image() function at line:

const size_t buffer_size = (tga_header.image_width * tga_header.image_height) * pixel_size;

The bug leads to Dynamic stack buffer overflow. Depending on the
context of the application, attack vector can be local or remote,
and can lead to code execution and/or system crash.
