## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 419 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2809080.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 38 new security patches for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  30 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html#FMW)

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security updates are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the Critical Patch Update October 2021 to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update October 2021 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2796575.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2796575.1).

## CKEditor 4.9.2

**Security Updates:**

* Fixed XSS vulnerability in the [Enhanced Image](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/image2) (`image2`) plugin reported by [Kyaw Min Thein](https://twitter.com/kyawminthein99).

  Issue summary: It was possible to execute XSS inside CKEditor using the `<img>` tag and specially crafted HTML. Please note that the default presets (Basic/Standard/Full) do not include this plugin, so you are only at risk if you made a custom build and enabled this plugin.

We would like to thank the [Drupal security team](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-security-team) for bringing this matter to our attention and coordinating the fix and release process!

* The [UI Color](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/uicolor) plugin now uses a custom color picker instead of the `YUI 2.7.0` library which has some known vulnerabilities (it's a security precaution, there was no security issue in CKEditor due to the way it was used).

* [#17010](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/17010): The [`CKEDITOR.dom.range.shrink()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dom_range.html#method-shrink) method now allows for skipping bogus `<br>` elements.

The issue was originally reported as a security issue by [Sriramk21](https://twitter.com/sriramk21) from Pegasystems and was later downgraded by the security team into a normal issue due to the requirement of having ACF turned off. Disabling [Advanced Content Filter](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_advanced_content_filter.html) is against [security best practices](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_best_practices.html#security), so the problem described above has not been considered a security issue as such.

## CKEditor 4.5.11

**Security Updates:**

* [Severity: minor] Fixed the `target="_blank"` vulnerability reported by James Gaskell.

  Issue summary: If a victim had access to a spoofed version of ckeditor.com via HTTP (e.g. due to DNS spoofing, using a hacked public network or mailicious hotspot), then when using a link to the ckeditor.com website it was possible for the attacker to change the current URL of the opening page, even if the opening page was protected with SSL.

  An upgrade is recommended.

## CKEditor 4.5 Beta

New Features:

* Clipboard (copy&paste, drag&drop) and file uploading features and improvements ([#11437](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11437)).

  + Major features:

    - Support for dropping and pasting files into the editor was introduced. Through a set of new facades for native APIs it is now possible to easily intercept and process inserted files.
    - [File upload tools](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.fileTools.html) were introduced in order to simplify controlling the loading, uploading and handling server response, properly handle [new upload configuration](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-uploadUrl) options, etc.
    - [Upload Image](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/uploadimage) widget was introduced to upload dropped images. A base class for the [upload widget](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.fileTools.uploadWidgetDefinition.html) was exposed, too, to make it simple to create new types of upload widgets which can handle any type of dropped file, show the upload progress and update the content when the process is done. It also handles editing and undo/redo operations when a file is being uploaded and integrates with the [notification aggregator](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.notificationAggregator.html) to show progress and success or error.
    - All drag and drop operations were integrated with the editor. All dropped content is passed through the [`editor#paste`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-paste) event and a set of new editor events was introduced — [`dragstart`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-dragstart), [`drop`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-drop), [`dragend`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-dragend).
    - The [Data Transfer](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.clipboard.dataTransfer.html) facade was introduced to unify access to data in various types and files. [Data Transfer](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.clipboard.dataTransfer.html) is now always available in the [`editor#paste`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-paste) event.
    - Switched from the pastebin to using the native clipboard access whenever possible. This solved many issues related to pastebin such as unnecessary scrolling or data loss. Additionally, on copy and cut from the editor the clipboard data is set. Therefore, on paste the editor has access to clean data, undisturbed by the browsers.
    - Drag and drop of inline and block widgets was integrated with the standard clipboard APIs. By listening to drag events you will thus be notified about widgets, too. This opens a possibility to filter pasted and dropped widgets.
    - The [`editor#paste`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-paste) event can have the `range` parameter so it is possible to change the paste position in the listener or paste in the not selectable position. Also the [`editor.insertHtml()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-insertHtml) method now accepts `range` as an additional parameter.
    - [#11621](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11621): A configurable [paste filter](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-pasteFilter) was introduced. The filter is by default turned to `'semantic-content'` on Webkit and Blink for all pasted content coming from external sources because of the low quality of HTML that these engines put into the clipboard. Internal and cross-editor paste is safe due to the change explained in the previous point.
  + Other changes and related fixes:

    - [#12095](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12095): On drag and copy of widgets [the same method](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-getSelectedHtml) is used to get selected HTML as in the normal case. Thanks to that styles applied to inline widgets are not lost.
    - [#11219](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11219): Fixed: Dragging a [captioned image](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/image2) does not fire the [`editor#paste`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-paste) event.
    - [#9554](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/9554): [Webkit Mac] Fixed: Editor scrolls on paste.
    - [#9898](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/9898): [Webkit&Divarea] Fixed: Pasting causes undesirable scrolling.
    - [#11993](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11993): [Chrome] Fixed: Pasting content scrolls the document.
    - [#12613](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12613): Show the user that they can not drop on editor UI (toolbar, bottom bar).
    - [#12851](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12851): [Blink/Webkit] Fixed: Formatting disappears when pasting content into cells.
    - [#12914](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12914): Fixed: Copy/Paste of table broken in `div`-based editor.
  + Browser support.
    Browser support for related features varies significantly (see <http://caniuse.com/clipboard>).

    - File APIs needed to operate and file upload is not supported in Internet Explorer 9 and below.
    - Only Chrome and Safari on Mac OS support setting custom data items in the clipboard, so currently it is possible to recognize the origin of the copied content in these browsers only. All drag and drop operations can be identified thanks to the new Data Transfer facade.
    - No Internet Explorer browser supports the standard clipboard API which results in small glitches like where only plain text can be dropped from outside the editor. Thanks to the new Data Transfer facade, internal and cross-editor drag and drop supports the full range of data.
    - Direct access to clipboard could only be implemented in Chrome, Safari on Mac OS, Opera and Firefox. In other browsers the pastebin must still be used.
* [#12875](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12875): Samples and toolbar configuration tools.

  + The old set of samples shipped with every CKEditor package was replaced with a shiny new single-page sample. This change concluded a long term plan which started from introducing the [CKEditor SDK](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/examples/index.html) and [CKEditor Features Overview](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/features.html) section in the documentation which essentially redefined the old samples.
  + Toolbar configurators with live previews were introduced. They will be shipped with every CKEditor package and are meant to help in configuring toolbar layouts.
* [#10925](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/10925): The [Media Embed](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/embed) and [Semantic Media Embed](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/embedsemantic) plugins were introduced. Read more about the new features in the [Embedding Content](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_media_embed.html) article.
* [#10931](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/10931): Added support for nesting widgets. It is now possible to insert one widget into another widget's nested editable. Note that unless nested editable's [allowed content](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget_nestedEditable_definition.html#property-allowedContent) is defined precisely, starting from CKEditor 4.5 some widget buttons may become enabled. This feature is not supported in IE8. Included issues:

  + [#12018](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12018): Fixed and reviewed: Nested widgets garbage collection.
  + [#12024](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12024): [Firefox] Fixed: Outline is extended to the left by unpositioned drag handlers.
  + [#12006](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12006): Fixed: Drag and drop of nested block widgets.
  + [#12008](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12008): Fixed various cases of inserting a single non-editable element using the [`editor.insertHtml()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-insertHtml) method. Fixes pasting a widget with a nested editable inside another widget's nested editable.
* Notification system:

  + [#11580](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11580): Introduced the [notification system](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.notification.html).
  + [#12810](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12810): Introduced a [notification aggregator](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.notificationAggregator.html) for the [notification system](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.notification.html) which simplifies displaying progress of many concurrent tasks.
* [#11636](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11636): Introduced new, UX-focused, methods for getting selected HTML and deleting it — [`editor.getSelectedHtml()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-getSelectedHtml) and [`editor.extractSelectedHtml()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-extractSelectedHtml).
* [#12416](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12416): Added the [`widget.definition.upcastPriority`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget_definition.html#property-upcastPriority) property which gives more control over widget upcasting order to the widget author.
* [#12036](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12036): Initialize the editor in [read-only](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#property-readOnly) mode when the `<textarea>` element has a `readonly` attribute.
* [#11905](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11905): The [`resize` event](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-resize) passes the current dimensions in its data.
* [#12126](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12126): Introduced [`config.image_prefillDimensions`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-image_prefillDimensions) and [`config.image2_prefillDimensions`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-image2_prefillDimensions) to make pre-filling `width` and `height` configurable for the [Enhanced Image](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/image2).
* [#12746](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12746): Added a new configuration option to hide the [Enhanced Image](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/image2) resizer.
* [#12150](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12150): Exposed the [`getNestedEditable()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget.html#static-method-getNestedEditable) and `is*` [widget helper](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.widget.html) functions (see the static methods).
* [#12448](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12448): Introduced the [`editable.insertHtmlIntoRange`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editable.html#method-insertHtmlIntoRange) method.
* [#12143](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12143): Added the [`config.floatSpacePreferRight`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-floatSpacePreferRight) configuration option that switches the alignment of the floating toolbar. Thanks to [InvisibleBacon](http://github.com/InvisibleBacon)!
* [#10986](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/10986): Added support for changing dialog input and textarea text directions by using the *Shift+Alt+Home/End* keystrokes. The direction is stored in the value of the input by prepending the [`\u202A`](http://unicode.org/cldr/utility/character.jsp?a=202A) or [`\u202B`](http://unicode.org/cldr/utility/character.jsp?a=202B) marker to it. Read more in the [documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dialog_definition_textInput.html#property-bidi). Thanks to [edithkk](https://github.com/edithkk)!
* [#12770](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12770): Added support for passing [widget](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.widget.html)'s startup data as a widget command's argument. Thanks to [Rebrov Boris](https://github.com/zipp3r) and [Tieme van Veen](https://github.com/tiemevanveen)!
* [#11583](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11583): Added support for the HTML5 `required` attribute in various form elements. Thanks to [Steven Busse](https://github.com/sbusse)!

Changes:

* [#12858](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12858): Basic [Spartan](http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/03/30/introducing-project-spartan-the-new-browser-built-for-windows-10/) browser compatibility. Full compatibility will be introduced later, because at the moment Spartan is still too unstable to be used for tests and we see many changes from version to version.
* [#12948](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12948): The [`config.mathJaxLibrary`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-mathJaxLib) option does not default to the MathJax CDN any more. It needs to be configured to enable the [Mathematical Formulas](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/mathjax) plugin now.
* [#13069](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/13069): Fixed inconsistencies between [`editable.insertHtml()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editable.html#method-insertElement) and [`editable.insertElement()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editable.html#method-insertElement) when the `range` parameter is used. Now, the `editor.insertElement()` method works on a higher level, which means that it saves undo snapshots and sets the selection after insertion. Use the [`editable.insertElementIntoRange()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editable.html#method-insertElementIntoRange) method directly for the pre 4.5 behavior of `editable.insertElement()`.
* [#12870](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12870): Use [`editor.showNotification()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-showNotification) instead of `alert()` directly whenever possible. When the [Notification plugin](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/notification) is loaded, the notification system is used automatically. Otherwise, the native `alert()` is displayed.
* [#8024](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/8024): Swapped behavior of the Split Cell Vertically and Horizontally features of the [Table Tools](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/tabletools) plugin to be more intuitive. Thanks to [kevinisagit](https://github.com/kevinisagit)!
* [#10903](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/10903): Performance improvements for the [`dom.element.addClass()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dom_element.html#method-addClass), [`dom.element.removeClass()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dom_element.html#method-removeClass) and [`dom.element.hasClass()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dom_element.html#method-hasClass) methods. Note: The previous implementation allowed passing multiple classes to `addClass()` although it was only a side effect of that implementation. The new implementation does not allow this.
* [#11856](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11856): The jQuery adapter throws a meaningful error if CKEditor or jQuery are not loaded.

Fixed issues:

* [#11586](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11586): Fixed: [`range.cloneContents()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dom_range.html#method-cloneContents) should not change the DOM in order not to affect selection.
* [#12148](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12148): Fixed: [`dom.element.getChild()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dom_element.html#method-getChild) should not modify a passed array.
* [#12503](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12503): [Blink/Webkit] Fixed: Incorrect result of Select All and *Backspace* or *Delete*.
* [#13001](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/13001): [Firefox] Fixed: The `<br />` filler is placed in the wrong position by the [`range.fixBlock()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dom_range.html#method-fixBlock) method due to quirky Firefox behavior.
* [#13101](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/13101): [IE8] Fixed: Colons are prepended to HTML5 element names when cloning them.

## CKEditor 4.4.8

**Security Updates:**

* Fixed XSS vulnerability in the HTML parser reported by [Dheeraj Joshi](https://twitter.com/dheerajhere) and [Prem Kumar](https://twitter.com/iAmPr3m).

  Issue summary: It was possible to execute XSS inside CKEditor after persuading the victim to: (i) switch CKEditor to source mode, then (ii) paste a specially crafted HTML code, prepared by the attacker, into the opened CKEditor source area, and (iii) switch back to WYSIWYG mode.

## CKEditor 4.4

**Important Notes:**

* Marked the [`editor.beforePaste`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-beforePaste) event as deprecated.
* The default class of captioned images has changed to `image` (was: `caption`). Please note that once edited in CKEditor 4.4+, all existing images of the `caption` class (`<figure class="caption">`) will be [filtered out](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_advanced_content_filter.html) unless the [`config.image2_captionedClass`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-image2_captionedClass) option is set to `caption`. For backward compatibility (i.e. when upgrading), it is highly recommended to use this setting, which also helps prevent CSS conflicts, etc. This does not apply to new CKEditor integrations.
* Widgets without defined buttons are no longer registered automatically to the [Advanced Content Filter](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_advanced_content_filter.html). Before CKEditor 4.4 widgets were registered to the ACF which was an incorrect behavior ([#11567](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11567)). This change should not have any impact on standard scenarios, but if your button does not execute the widget command, you need to set [`allowedContent`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_feature.html#property-allowedContent) and [`requiredContent`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_feature.html#property-requiredContent) properties for it manually, because the editor will not be able to find them.
* The [Show Borders](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/showborders) plugin was added to the Standard installation package in order to ensure that unstyled tables are still visible for the user ([#11665](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11665)).
* Since CKEditor 4.4 the editor instance should be passed to [`CKEDITOR.style`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.style.html) methods to ensure full compatibility with other features (e.g. applying styles to widgets requires that). We ensured backward compatibility though, so the [`CKEDITOR.style`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.style.html) will work even when the editor instance is not provided.

New Features:

* [#11297](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11297): Styles can now be applied to widgets. The definition of a style which can be applied to a specific widget must contain two additional properties — `type` and `widget`. Read more in the [Widget Styles](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_styles.html#widget-styles) section of the "Syles Drop-down" guide. Note that by default, widgets support only classes and no other attributes or styles. Related changes and features:
  + Introduced the [`CKEDITOR.style.addCustomHandler()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_style.html#static-method-addCustomHandler) method for registering custom style handlers.
  + The [`CKEDITOR.style.apply()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_style.html#method-apply) and [`CKEDITOR.style.remove()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_style.html#method-remove) methods are now called with an editor instance instead of the document so they can be reused by the [`CKEDITOR.editor.applyStyle()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-applyStyle) and [`CKEDITOR.editor.removeStyle()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-removeStyle) methods. Backward compatibility was preserved, but from CKEditor 4.4 it is highly recommended to pass an editor instead of a document to these methods.
  + Many new methods and properties were introduced in the [Widget API](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.widget.html) to make the handling of styles by widgets fully customizable. See: [`widget.definition.styleableElements`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget_definition.html#property-styleableElements), [`widget.definition.styleToAllowedContentRule`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget_definition.html#property-styleToAllowedContentRules), [`widget.addClass()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget.html#method-addClass), [`widget.removeClass()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget.html#method-removeClass), [`widget.getClasses()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget.html#method-getClasses), [`widget.hasClass()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget.html#method-hasClass), [`widget.applyStyle()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget.html#method-applyStyle), [`widget.removeStyle()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget.html#method-removeStyle), [`widget.checkStyleActive()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget.html#method-checkStyleActive).
  + Integration with the [Allowed Content Filter](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_advanced_content_filter.html) required an introduction of the [`CKEDITOR.style.toAllowedContent()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_style.html#method-toAllowedContentRules) method which can be implemented by the custom style handler and if exists, it is used by the [`CKEDITOR.filter`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.filter.html) to translate a style to [allowed content rules](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.filter.allowedContentRules.html).
* [#11300](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11300): Various changes in the [Enhanced Image](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/image2) plugin:
  + Introduced the [`config.image2_captionedClass`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-image2_captionedClass) option to configure the class of captioned images.
  + Introduced the [`config.image2_alignClasses`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-image2_alignClasses) option to configure the way images are aligned with CSS classes.
    If this setting is defined, the editor produces classes instead of inline styles for aligned images.
  + Default image caption can be translated (customized) with the `editor.lang.image2.captionPlaceholder` string.
* [#11341](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11341): [Enhanced Image](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/image2) plugin: It is now possible to add a link to any image type.
* [#10202](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/10202): Introduced wildcard support in the [Allowed Content Rules](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_allowed_content_rules.html) format.
* [#10276](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/10276): Introduced blacklisting in the [Allowed Content Filter](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_advanced_content_filter.html).
* [#10480](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/10480): Introduced code snippets with code highlighting. There are two versions available so far — the default [Code Snippet](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/codesnippet) which uses the [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org) library and the [Code Snippet GeSHi](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/codesnippetgeshi) which uses the [GeSHi](http://qbnz.com/highlighter/) library.
* [#11737](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11737): Introduced an option to prevent [filtering](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_advanced_content_filter.html) of an element that matches custom criteria (see [`filter.addElementCallback()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_filter.html#method-addElementCallback)).
* [#11532](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11532): Introduced the [`editor.addContentsCss()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-addContentsCss) method that can be used for [adding custom CSS files](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/plugin_sdk_styles.html).
* [#11536](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11536): Added the [`CKEDITOR.tools.htmlDecode()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_tools.html#method-htmlDecode) method for decoding HTML entities.
* [#11225](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11225): Introduced the [`CKEDITOR.tools.transparentImageData`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_tools.html#property-transparentImageData) property which contains transparent image data to be used in CSS or as image source.

Other Changes:

* [#11377](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11377): Unified internal representation of empty anchors using the [fake objects](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/fakeobjects).

* [#5217](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/5217): Setting data (including switching between modes) creates a new undo snapshot. Besides that:
  + Introduced the [`editable.status`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editable.html#property-status) property.
  + Introduced a new `forceUpdate` option for the [`editor.lockSnapshot`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-lockSnapshot) event.
  + Fixed: Selection not being unlocked in inline editor after setting data ([#11500](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11500)).
* The [WebSpellChecker](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/wsc) plugin was updated to the latest version.

Fixed Issues:

* [#10190](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/10190): Fixed: Removing block style with [`editor.removeStyle()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-removeStyle) should result in a paragraph and not a div.

## CKEditor 4.3 Beta

New Features:

* [#9764](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/9764): Widget System.
  + [Widget plugin](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/widget) introducing the [Widget API](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.widget.html).
  + New [`editor.enterMode`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#property-enterMode) and [`editor.shiftEnterMode`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#property-shiftEnterMode) properties – normalized versions of [`config.enterMode`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-enterMode) and [`config.shiftEnterMode`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-shiftEnterMode).
  + Dynamic editor settings. Starting from CKEditor 4.3 Beta, *Enter* mode values and [content filter](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_advanced_content_filter.html) instances may be changed dynamically (for example when the caret was placed in an element in which editor features should be adjusted). When you are implementing a new editor feature, you should base its behavior on [dynamic](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#property-activeEnterMode) or [static](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#property-enterMode) *Enter* mode values depending on whether this feature works in selection context or globally on editor content.
    - Dynamic *Enter* mode values – [`editor.setActiveEnterMode()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-setActiveEnterMode) method, [`editor.activeEnterModeChange`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-activeEnterModeChange) event, and two properties: [`editor.activeEnterMode`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#property-activeEnterMode) and [`editor.activeShiftEnterMode`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#property-activeShiftEnterMode).
    - Dynamic content filter instances – [`editor.setActiveFilter()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-setActiveFilter) method, [`editor.activeFilterChange`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-activeFilterChange) event, and [`editor.activeFilter`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#property-activeFilter) property.
  + "Fake" selection was introduced. It makes it possible to virtually select any element when the real selection remains hidden. See the [`selection.fake()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dom_selection.html#method-fake) method.
  + Default [`htmlParser.filter`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.htmlParser.filter.html) rules are not applied to non-editable elements (elements with `contenteditable` attribute set to `false` and their descendants) anymore. To add a rule which will be applied to all elements you need to pass an additional argument to the [`filter.addRules()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_htmlParser_filter.html#method-addRules) method.
  + Dozens of new methods were introduced – most interesting ones:
    - [`document.find()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dom_document.html#method-find),
    - [`document.findOne()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dom_document.html#method-findOne),
    - [`editable.insertElementIntoRange()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editable.html#method-insertElementIntoRange),
    - [`range.moveToClosestEditablePosition()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dom_range.html#method-moveToClosestEditablePosition),
    - New methods for [`htmlParser.node`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.htmlParser.node.html) and [`htmlParser.element`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.htmlParser.element.html).
* [#10659](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/10659): New [Enhanced Image](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/image2) plugin that introduces a widget with integrated image captions, an option to center images, and dynamic "click and drag" resizing.
* [#10664](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/10664): New [Mathematical Formulas](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/mathjax) plugin that introduces the MathJax widget.
* [#7987](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/7987): New [Language](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/language) plugin that implements Language toolbar button to support [WCAG 3.1.2 Language of Parts](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning-other-lang-id.html).
* [#10708](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/10708): New [smileys](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/smiley).

**Important Notes:**

* Dropped compatibility support for Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 3.6.
* Both the Basic and the Standard distribution packages will not contain the new [Indent Block](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/indentblock) plugin. Because of this the [Advanced Content Filter](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_advanced_content_filter.html) might remove block indentations from existing contents. If you want to prevent this, either [add an appropriate ACF rule to your filter](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_allowed_content_rules.html) or create a custom build based on the Basic/Standard package and add the Indent Block plugin in [CKBuilder](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/builder).

    current configuration can handle.
  + Based on [`config.allowedContent`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-allowedContent) rules - the data

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 497 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [January 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2832416.1).

**Please note that on December 10, 2021, Oracle released a Security Alert for Apache Log4j vulnerabilities [CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2021-44228.html). Customers should review the Alert if they have not already done so.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 342 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2788740.1).

### Affected Products and Patch Information

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.
