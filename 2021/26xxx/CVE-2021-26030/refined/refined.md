- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Inadequate escaping of the logo parameter in the default templates used for error pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into error pages, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the logo parameter, which is used in the rendering of error pages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the logo parameter used by the application on error pages. The specific method is not detailed.
