Package        : openexr
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-3598 CVE-2021-3605 CVE-2021-3933 CVE-2021-3941
                 CVE-2021-23215 CVE-2021-26260 CVE-2021-45942
Debian Bug     : 992703 990450 990899 1014828 1014828

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been found in OpenEXR, command-line
tools and a library for the OpenEXR image format. Buffer overflows or
out-of-bound reads could lead to a denial of service (application crash) if a
malformed image file is processed.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5.4-2+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openexr packages.

For the detailed security status of openexr please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openexr>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Debian Bug     : 986796 992703 990450 990899 1014828

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been found in OpenEXR, command-line
tools and a library for the OpenEXR image format. Buffer overflows or
out-of-bound reads could lead to a denial of service (application crash) if
a malformed image file is processed.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.2.1-4.1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your openexr packages.

For the detailed security status of openexr please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openexr>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

Debian Bug     : 986796 990450

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenEXR, a library and
tools for the OpenEXR high dynamic-range (HDR) image format. An
attacker could cause a denial of service (DoS) through application
crash and excessive memory consumption.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.2.0-11+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your openexr packages.

For the detailed security status of openexr please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openexr>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
