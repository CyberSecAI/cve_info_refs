Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26260:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an integer overflow within the `Imf_2_5::DwaCompressor::initializeBuffers` function in the OpenEXR library. This overflow occurs when calculating the buffer size needed for DWA compression, potentially leading to a heap buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The calculation of the buffer size for the DWA compressor is vulnerable to integer overflow. Specifically, the code was using `int` type, which has limited size and can wrap around, and also performing type casting between size_t and int, where it loses size bits.
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** If the integer overflow occurs, it can lead to allocation of smaller-than-required buffer. When data is later written to the undersized buffer, a heap buffer overflow can occur.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service. An attacker can craft a malformed OpenEXR image file that triggers the integer overflow. This leads to a heap buffer overflow during the buffer allocation process within the `DwaCompressor` which causes the application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Image File:** An attacker needs to provide a specifically crafted OpenEXR image file to the vulnerable application or library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File Injection:** The attacker must be able to supply a specially crafted OpenEXR file to a program using the vulnerable OpenEXR library.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects OpenEXR versions prior to 3.0.1.
*   **Fix:** The fix involves using `size_t` and `size_t` calculation instead of `int`, preventing the integer overflow. The fix has been implemented in commit 36ea55a362558b08e7f5c3b04c6724eaad47b4e8.
*   **Patches:** Patches have been backported to older versions of the library in several distributions, including Fedora and Debian.
*   **Upstream Fix:** The vulnerability was addressed in upstream commit https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/894/commits/36ea55a362558b08e7f5c3b04c6724eaad47b4e8
*   The issue was originally identified through oss-fuzz.
*   The fix was also made in https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/901 where size_t was used for calculation.
