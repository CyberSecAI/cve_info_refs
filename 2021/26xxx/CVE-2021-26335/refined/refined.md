- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input and range checking in the AMD Secure Processor (ASP) boot loader image header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient validation of attacker-controlled values in the ASP boot loader image header before signature validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Attacker-controlled values in the ASP boot loader image header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to control the values present in the ASP boot loader image header.
