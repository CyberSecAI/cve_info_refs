Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-26372:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient bound checks related to PCIE (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) in the System Management Unit (SMU).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of proper validation of PCIE related data within the SMU. This allows the possibility of accessing memory outside of the intended bounds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Access to an invalid address space, potentially leading to a denial of service. The system may become unresponsive, preventing normal operation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests or data to the SMU.
- The vulnerability is within the System Management Unit and could be triggered through an interface exposed to software or firmware components.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker needs to have the ability to communicate with the SMU, likely through software or firmware level access, to trigger the insufficient bounds check.
-  Potentially a malicious or compromised User Application (UApp) or AGESA Boot Loader (ABL) could exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
-  The vulnerability affects 2nd and 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processors.
-  The vulnerability was reported by Shawn Hoffman from Microsoft Offensive Security Research.
-  Mitigation involves updating to specific AGESA PI package versions.
