-   **Input Validation Failure:** The module fails to properly validate the contents of the `Cookie` header leading to the dereference.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of this vulnerability results in a server crash due to the NULL pointer dereference, leading to a potential denial of service attack.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

-   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request containing a malicious `Cookie` header.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network Access:** An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
