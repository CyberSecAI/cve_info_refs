Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information from the provided content, specifically focusing on CVE-2021-26691:

**1.  Gentoo Security Advisory:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The advisory mentions a heap overflow in `mod_session`. This implies a memory management issue where a specially crafted session header can lead to writing beyond allocated buffer in the heap.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: Heap overflow in `mod_session`.
*  **Impact of Exploitation**:  Could result in a Denial of Service condition.
*   **Attack Vectors**: Remote.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A remote attacker can send a crafted Session Header to exploit this vulnerability.

**2. Fedora Project Update Notifications:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: Identifies the vulnerability as a "Heap overflow in mod\_session."
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: Heap overflow.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: (Not explicitly stated but implied) A heap overflow can lead to crashes and denial of service.
*  **Attack Vectors**: Not explicitly stated.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** (Not explicitly stated) A remote attacker that can send HTTP requests.

**3. Debian Security Advisory:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: Refers to "Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTP server" that could lead to a denial-of-service.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:  Does not give specific details but includes CVE-2021-26691 in the list of CVEs to address.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**:  Denial of Service.
*   **Attack Vectors**: Not explicitly stated.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: Not explicitly stated.

**4. Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: Oracle lists `CVE-2021-26691` as a vulnerability in their `Oracle Construction and Engineering Suite` with the component being `Core (Apache HTTP Server)`. This indicates that the underlying Apache HTTP Server used by their product is affected and specifically the `mod_session` component.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: Heap overflow
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: (Not explicitly stated) A heap overflow can lead to crashes and denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors**: HTTP.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A remote attacker can send a crafted Session Header to exploit this vulnerability.

**5. Apache HTTP Server Vulnerabilities Page:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: Describes a  "mod\_session response handling heap overflow" caused by a "specially crafted SessionHeader sent by an origin server".
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: A heap overflow in the `mod_session` module.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: (Not explicitly stated) A heap overflow vulnerability can lead to denial-of-service or potentially more serious impacts.
*   **Attack Vectors**: HTTP requests with a specially crafted `SessionHeader`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A malicious origin server sending a crafted response, with the vulnerable server acting as a proxy, could trigger this vulnerability.

**6. Openwall Mailing List:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: States "A specially crafted SessionHeader sent by an origin server could cause a heap overflow".
*    **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: Heap overflow.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: (Not explicitly stated) A heap overflow can lead to crashes and denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors**: Origin server sends a specially crafted Session header to the vulnerable server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A malicious origin server sending a crafted response.

**7. NetApp Security Advisory:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**:  States that `CVE-2021-26691` is related to a vulnerability in Apache httpd versions prior to 2.4.48, which when exploited could lead to DoS.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:  Not explicitly stated, but it's implied to be in the Apache httpd itself.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**:  Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Attack Vectors**: Not explicitly stated.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: Not explicitly stated.

**Summary of Findings**

The information across multiple sources consistently points to a heap overflow vulnerability within the `mod_session` module of Apache HTTP Server, identified as CVE-2021-26691. This vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted session header, which can be sent by a malicious client or a compromised backend server. The most common impact is a denial of service due to the server crashing. While the description is consistent across sources, the level of detail varies.  The oracle advisory points out that this affects the underlying Apache HTTP Server, used as a component within its products.

The Gentoo advisory provides the most direct description of the vulnerability and a general impact. The Apache HTTP Server page describes the root cause involving malicious origin server responses.
