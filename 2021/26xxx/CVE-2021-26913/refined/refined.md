The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in NetMotion Mobility Server related to deserialization of untrusted data, and it is related to CVE-2021-26913 as it is one of the listed CVEs in the document.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerabilities is the unsafe deserialization of untrusted data within several servlets of the NetMotion Mobility Server. The server uses `ObjectInputStream.readObject()` on data directly or indirectly controlled by the attacker without proper validation, leading to remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Deserialization of untrusted data. Specifically, the `readObject` method is called on attacker-controlled data without any validation.
- Multiple vulnerable endpoints exist:
    - `com.nmwco.server.support.SupportRpcServlet`: Directly deserializes the input stream.
    - `com.nmwco.server.events.EventRpcServlet`: Uses a dispatcher to read an `RpcData` object from the input stream.
    - `com.nmwco.server.mvc.MvcServlet` combined with `MvcUtil.valueStringToObject`: Deserializes data from the `Mvc_x_Form_x_Name` request parameter after base64 decoding and gzip inflation.
    - `com.nmwco.server.webrepdb.StatusServlet`: Deserializes data in the dispatcher for GET or POST requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with SYSTEM privileges. This could lead to complete compromise of the server and the network it is part of.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted serialized Java object to the vulnerable endpoints:
    - `POST` request to `/SupportRpcServlet` with the payload in the request body.
    - `POST` request to `/EventRpcServlet` with the payload in the request body.
    - `GET` or `POST` request to `/mobility/Menu/isLoggedOn` with the payload (base64 encoded and gzip compressed) in the `Mvc_x_Form_x_Name` parameter.
    - `POST` request to `/WebRepDb/status` with the payload in the request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have network access to the NetMotion Mobility Server and be able to send HTTP requests.
- No authentication is required to exploit these vulnerabilities.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious serialized Java object using tools like `ysoserial`.
