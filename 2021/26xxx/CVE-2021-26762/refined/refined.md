Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** This content is related to a vulnerability, but it is not associated with a specific CVE ID. The exploit-db page lists **CVE: N/A**.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `edit-course.php` page of the Student Record System 4.0 application. This vulnerability exists due to improper sanitization or validation of the `cid` parameter passed in the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Specifically, a time-based blind SQL injection is identified.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Access:** An attacker can gain access to the underlying database by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability. This allows them to read sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and other data stored in the database.
- **Data Modification:**  The attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database user's privileges, an attacker might escalate their privileges within the database server, potentially gaining access to the operating system.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can extract sensitive information such as the database name, current user, etc., as shown in the provided sqlmap output.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector is through manipulation of the `cid` parameter in the HTTP GET request to the `edit-course.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft the malicious queries for the injection.
- **Familiarity with Tools:** Knowledge of SQL injection tools like sqlmap is beneficial for automating exploitation.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is demonstrated using a time-based blind SQL injection payload:
   ```
   cid=7' AND (SELECT 9265 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))ljCB) AND 'yXjI'='yXjI
   ```
- The sqlmap tool is used to confirm the exploitability, which identifies a time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability.
- The sqlmap output shows that the tool was able to:
    - Identify the vulnerability
    - Confirm that the database is MySQL
    - Extract the current database user (root@localhost)
    - Extract the current database (schoolmanagement)
