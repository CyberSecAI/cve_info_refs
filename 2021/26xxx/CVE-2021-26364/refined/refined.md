The content is related to CVE-2021-26364.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient bounds checking in the System Management Unit (SMU) mailbox register.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A lack of proper bounds checking on the SMU mailbox register. This allows an attacker to potentially read outside of the intended SRAM address range.

**Impact of exploitation:** Reading outside the SRAM address range could trigger an exception handling routine, potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through a malicious request via the SMU mailbox interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need the ability to send a crafted request through the SMU mailbox to exploit the insufficient bounds checking. The exact nature of this access is not detailed, but it is implied to be a privilege level that can interact with the SMU.
