- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `Deserializer::read_vec()` function in the `cdr` crate created an uninitialized buffer and then passed it to a user-provided `Read` implementation, specifically `Deserializer.reader.read_exact()`. This is undefined behavior in Rust as `read_exact` expects a fully initialized buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the use of an uninitialized buffer with the `read_exact` function, leading to undefined behavior. This violates the assumptions of the `Read` trait in Rust, which requires the buffer to be initialized before reading into it.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The undefined behavior can lead to various consequences, including reading uninitialized memory, data corruption, crashes, and potentially other unpredictable issues. The severity of the impact depends on the specific usage and the nature of the uninitialized memory.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when `Deserializer::read_vec()` is called with a user-provided reader implementation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need the ability to provide input that triggers `Deserializer::read_vec` and have control over the reader implementation in order to exploit the vulnerability. However, since the CVSS score is 9.8 with no required privileges, the attacker may not need specific access or high privileges.
