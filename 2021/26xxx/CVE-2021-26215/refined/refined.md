{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The SeedDMS application does not properly validate the origin of requests to the out.EditDocument.php endpoint, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can modify a victim's documents by tricking them into submitting a crafted request. This includes changing the document's name, comment, keywords, categories, and other editable fields.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to host a malicious HTML page and trick a victim user into visiting the page while logged into SeedDMS.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to host an HTML page and trick a victim user into visiting the page while logged into SeedDMS. The attacker does not need any prior access or valid credentials other than victim's current session."
