Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal issue within the WebDAV endpoint of AfterLogic Aurora and WebMail Pro products. Specifically, the `dav/server.php` script does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling file requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Directory Traversal:** The application fails to sanitize the URI, allowing an attacker to use `..` sequences to navigate outside the intended directory and access arbitrary files within the webroot.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `exec` function in `\libraries\Sabre\DAV\server.php` does not sanitize the provided parameters before using them to access files.
*   **Publicly Accessible Credentials:** The built-in user `caldav_public_user@localhost` with the password `caldav_public_user` is used by the WebDAV endpoint, allowing unauthenticated access to the vulnerable functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read arbitrary files within the webroot, including sensitive configuration files containing database credentials, admin panel credentials, and license keys.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Access to sensitive information could facilitate further attacks, such as gaining administrative access to the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the WebDAV endpoint (`/dav/server.php`).
*   **Path Traversal:** The request includes directory traversal sequences (`..`) to access files outside the intended directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Exploitation does not require prior authentication due to the use of default, public credentials.

**Affected Products:**
* AfterLogic Aurora versions 7.7.9 and below.
* AfterLogic WebMail Pro versions 7.7.9 and below.

**More Details:**
The provided content goes into greater detail than the standard CVE description, outlining the exact vulnerable code path:

1. `dav\server.php` handles the request, creating an instance of `afterlogic\DAV\Server`.
2. `\libraries\Sabre\DAV\server.php` passes the request method and URI to the `exec` function.
3. `exec` passes the request to `invokeMethod`
4. `invokeMethod` passes the request to `httpGet`
5. The directory traversal issue is triggered in `exec`, due to the lack of input sanitation, allowing the attacker to read arbitrary files using `httpGet`.

The content also explicitly states that an attacker can use the built in `caldav_public_user@localhost` account with the password `caldav_public_user` to gain unauthenticated access, further highlighting the severity of the vulnerability.
