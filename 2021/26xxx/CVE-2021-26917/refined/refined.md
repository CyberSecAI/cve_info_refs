  "CVE-2021-26917": {
    "related": true,
    "information": [
      {
        "type": "vulnerability",
        "detail": "The vulnerability stems from the `apinotifypath` setting in `keys.dat`, which allows users to specify a script to be executed upon certain API events. The provided script, when interpreted by bash instead of Python due to a misconfiguration or oversight, triggers unexpected behavior.\n\nSpecifically, the script imports Python libraries, which results in the execution of `import-im6.q16` (an ImageMagick component), leading to attempts to capture the screen. This is caused by ImageMagick's attempt to write to a file with a specific extension that triggers a screen capture operation, with file names matching the name of the imported python modules.\n\nThis behavior is unexpected and could be exploited to take screenshots of the user's desktop. The Poal.co content indicates that this behavior is triggered by mouse clicks, as each `import` statement within the specified script will cause a new attempt to capture the screen and create a file. The user reported that while testing in a sandboxed environment, the files created were empty, but outside of a sandbox the newly generated files might be PostScript or Bitmap images of the captured screen. The user also reported the GUI is unresponsive and a crosshair replaces the mouse pointer, suggesting that an active capture process occurs each time."
      },
      {
        "type": "impact",
        "detail": "An attacker can potentially capture screenshots of the victim's desktop. Though there is no evidence that these screen captures were transported away from the local host, it is possible to have the script write to a file and exfiltrate the file later if the security sandbox does not block it. The unexpected behavior can also cause a denial of service, making the application unresponsive and interrupting the user's workflow."
      },
       {
        "type": "attack vector",
         "detail": "The primary attack vector involves an attacker controlling the `apinotifypath` setting within the `keys.dat` configuration file. This can be achieved if the attacker has access to the file system and can modify this configuration or if the attacker can trick the user into modifying the configuration or using a malicious configuration file."
      },
      {
        "type": "attacker capabilities",
        "detail":"The attacker must have the ability to modify the `keys.dat` file in the PyBitmessage configuration folder, either through direct access to the file system or by social engineering to trick the user into using a malicious configuration. The attacker will also need to provide the malicious script to be executed."
      },
     {
        "type": "weaknesses",
         "detail": "The primary vulnerability is due to a misconfiguration or oversight in how PyBitmessage handles the `apinotifypath` setting, leading to unintended execution of an external script by bash instead of python. Additionally, the application's lack of proper sandboxing or input sanitization allows the arbitrary execution of commands. The reliance on ImageMagick for screen capture also contributes to the attack vector."
