# Screen Capture

Adversaries may attempt to take screen captures of the desktop to gather information over the course of an operation. Screen capturing functionality may be included as a feature of a remote access tool used in post-compromise operations. Taking a screenshot is also typically possible through native utilities or API calls, such as `CopyFromScreen`, `xwd`, or `screencapture`.[[1]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.graphics.copyfromscreen?view=netframework-4.8)[[2]](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2017/01/new-mac-backdoor-using-antiquated-code/)

## Mitigations

This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since
it is based on the abuse of system features.

## Detection

| ID | Data Source | Data Component | Detects |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [DS0017](/datasources/DS0017) | [Command](/datasources/DS0017) | [Command Execution](/datasources/DS0017/#Command%20Execution) | Monitor executed commands and arguments that may attempt to take screen captures of the desktop to gather information over the course of an operation. |
| [DS0009](/datasources/DS0009) | [Process](/datasources/DS0009) | [OS API Execution](/datasources/DS0009/#OS%20API%20Execution) | Monitoring for screen capture behavior will depend on the method used to obtain data from the operating system and write output files. Detection methods could include collecting information from unusual processes using API calls used to obtain image data, and monitoring for image files written to disk, such as `CopyFromScreen`, `xwd`, or `screencapture`.[[1]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.graphics.copyfromscreen?view=netframework-4.8)[[2]](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2017/01/new-mac-backdoor-using-antiquated-code/). The sensor data may need to be correlated with other events to identify malicious activity, depending on the legitimacy of this behavior within a given network environment. |

[Emergency release to fix an exploitable bug](/Bitmessage/PyBitmessage/releases/tag/v0.6.3)
[Latest](/Bitmessage/PyBitmessage/releases/latest)

[Latest](/Bitmessage/PyBitmessage/releases/latest)

Version 0.6.2 has a bug that can be exploited for remote code execution. This is an emergency release, and 0.6.4 will be released in a couple of days with cleanup originally intended for 0.6.3, and full release notes. Everyone who uses 0.6.2 should upgrade (or, if upgrade is not possible, downgrade).

Apart from the emergency fix, this release contains a new network subsystem which requires less resources (CPU and memory) and the Dandelion++ protocol extension for enhanced privacy.

Windows and OSX binaries follow soon.

[More strict exploit mitigation](/Bitmessage/PyBitmessage/releases/tag/0.6.3.2)

This version is an update on 0.6.3 with a more strict exploit mitigation code. Users of 0.6.2 should either upgrade to 0.6.3.2 or downgrade to 0.6.1.

February 16th: Windows binary available, signed both with a code signing key and a GPG key. Note: there won't be a 64bit Windows binary for 0.6.3.2 due to a lack of time. The new network subsystem has significantly improved CPU and memory requirements so you shouldn't be running low on memory even with the 32bit binary.

February 17th: OSX binary available, only GPG signed, will be released code signed in the near future.

February 19th: OSX code signing delayed for a couple of days for technical reasons.

================================================================================
UPDATE FOR: Potential Security Bug in PyBitmessage and/or Python2 Interpreter
================================================================================
Monday, February 8, 2021

This addendum to the prior report supplies additional data on how to replicate the bug events mentioned in the report.

Place this script in the PyBitmessage /src directory or subfolder of /src.
================================================================================
#!/usr/bin/env python2

# 'apinotifypath' in keys.dat calls this script.

import xmlrpclib
import json
import time
import base64
import api
import os
import random
import subprocess
from time import gmtime, strftime

exit()
================================================================================

2. Set the API notify path 'apinotifipath = /full/path/to/script/file
3. Start the PyBitmessage client.
4. The effects will be observed, with ImageMagick screen capture invoked and files with names of python modules generated in the directory when clicking with the mouse.
5. Outside of a security policy sandbox, on some systems the newly generated files may be PostScript or Bitmap images of the captured screen.

In the prior report, it was reported that this bug event occurs with the PyBitmessage GUI interface. In additional testing, the bug is also replicated if PyBitmessage is invoked as a daemon without the QT graphical interface. The results are the same, with screen capture invocation and creation of files named after Python modules. This means that a PyBitmessage daemon instance without a GUI is also vulnerable to the screen capture bug.

================================================================================
END OF UPDATE. PRIOR REPORT FOLLOWS.
================================================================================

================================================================================
PRIOR REPORT
================================================================================
Potential Security Bug in PyBitmessage and/or Python2 Interpreter
================================================================================

Environment: Linux Mint LDME, AKA "LinuxMint 4 Debbie", Debian base system.
This was replicated on other LinuxMint Versions, and presumably may occur on other Linux Distros.

Scenario: Command line invocation of graphical PyBitmessage client in a jail that catches security violations, seccomp calls, etc. A python script is activated by API notify path.

================================================================================
POTENTIALLY EXPLOITABLE SECURITY EVENT
================================================================================

mport-im6.q16: attempt to perform an operation not allowed by the security policy `PS' @ error/constitute.c/IsCoderAuthorized/408.

================================================================================
BEHAVIOR AND RESULTS
================================================================================

Problem: The Python2 module imports activate ImageMagick screen capture which attempts to save ImageMagic / PostScript screenshots to files named after the python modules.

When: Immediately as the PyBitmessage QT interface appears on the screen during startup.

What: A crosshairs appears and replaces the mouse cursor. It appears to be a imagemagick-type screenshot pointer. This is bizarre and unexpected behavior that has nothing to do with the purpose of the application or any component thereof.

In the right conditions the screen captures could happen completely invisibly to the user outside a sandbox setup.

Behavior: Interface stops responding to clicks. Entire desktop interface no longer responds to clicks at site of mouse cursor. After about a half dozen clicks the crosshairs disappear. The mouse pointer cursor re-appears and then gui elements are able to respond.

Several new files are surreptitiously created in a subfolder during this interaction: the filenames are:

api
base64
json
random
subprocess
time
os
xmlrpclib

The screen capture occurs for each import statement, and hangs application execution, and after a mouse click the next import statement hangs the interface, until all the imports are processed--one mouse click for each import.

The files are created as empty files with no content. It appears the security sandbox prevents screen images from being captured and written to the files. Although ImageMagick is installed on the test system, the security sandbox in this scenario blocks all calls to the screen capture functions. More analysis is necessary to determine exactly what is happening. Whether or not this bug event is malicious or accidental is yet to be determined.

It appears that calls to import some python2 libraries are a contributing factor to this event. The filenames are names of python modules.

================================================================================
RELATED EVENTS
================================================================================

In some other tests in different conditions imagemagick screenshot images were automatically generated in a subfolder, with the files being named after imported python modules. These screenshot images were full-resolution screenshots of the graphical user interface at the time of the event. In this current instance it appears that no actual image data was written to the files due to sandbox security policy.

================================================================================
SEVERITY RATING
================================================================================

Not yet determined.

================================================================================
MITIGATION
================================================================================

Security mitigation may not be necessary as there is no evidence yet that these screen intercepts are actually transported away from the local host. This needs to be looked into. It may be a bug in Python and not the PyBitmessage codebase. However it has exploit potential.

1. Confine the PyBitmessage application to a secure sandbox that blocks all calls to the screen.
2. Run PyBitmessage sandboxed in daemon mode and use a alternative, trusted interface to connect to the API.
3. Deploy Bitmessage protocol interface using a graphics system that is segregated from Python, ImageMagick and Muffin WM, the latter being heavily dependent upon Python.
4. Do not use the apinotifypath feature of PyBitmessage for any Python application. The Pythonic recursion of import calls contributes to the erratic behavior.

Notes: Python interpreter does a lot of memory mapping access. It is possible that recursive import calls from subscripts may open up access to memory, making it writable from within a Python module or application.

================================================================================
RELATED EVENTS
================================================================================
In some other tests in different conditions imagemagick screenshot images were automatically generated in a subfolder, with the files being named after imported python modules. These screenshot images were full-resolution screenshots of the graphical user interface at the time of the event. In this current instance it appears that no actual image data was written to the files due to sandbox security policy.
================================================================================
SEVERITY RATING
================================================================================
Not yet determined.
================================================================================
MITIGATION
================================================================================
Security mitigation may not be necessary as there is no evidence yet that these screen intercepts are actually transported away from the local host. This needs to be looked into. It may be a bug in Python and not the PyBitmessage codebase. However it has exploit potential.
1. Confine the PyBitmessage application to a secure sandbox that blocks all calls to the screen.
2. Run PyBitmessage sandboxed in daemon mode and use a alternative, trusted interface to connect to the API.
3. Deploy Bitmessage protocol interface using a graphics system that is segregated from Python, ImageMagick and Muffin WM, the latter being heavily dependent upon Python.
4. Do not use the apinotifypath feature of PyBitmessage for any Python application. The Pythonic recursion of import calls contributes to the erratic behavior.
Notes: Python interpreter does a lot of memory mapping access. It is possible that recursive import calls from subscripts may open up access to memory, making it writable from within a Python module or application.

Currently waiting to hear back from the CVE people at MITRE Corporation.

I recommend running Bitmessage inside a security sandbox that blocks all access to video and screencap, just to be on the safe side.

It was pointed out to me that the behaviour can be explained by the script being interpreted through bash rather than python. This sounds like a reasonable interpretation. So in the worst case, this is a non-security bug, but I'm not even sure it's a bug at this moment. It certainly isn't an exploit as all code needs to be provided by user. apinotify script takes an argument, which is one out of a couple of fixed strings.

It looks to me like something attacked the submitter's computer, and left backdoors that affected PyBitmessage. Possibly, the submitter installed an already compromised copy of PyBitmessage from somewhere.

I'm skeptical that this report represents an exploit against the current version of PyBitmessage.

The source wishes to remain anonymous. Kinda the whole point of Bitmessage.

I'm not talking about the source of the message, I'm talking about the source to fork and commit where that security update is supposedly from.
