  "CVE-2021-26117": {
    "description": "The optional ActiveMQ LDAP login module can be configured to use anonymous access to the LDAP server.",
    "root_cause": "The ActiveMQ LDAP login module could be configured to use anonymous access to the LDAP server, which allows verification of a user's password using an anonymous context, skipping password checks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure authentication mechanism",
      "Use of anonymous context for authentication"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access by leveraging the misconfigured LDAP login module.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to the vulnerable ActiveMQ instance",
      "Configuration of the ActiveMQ LDAP login module for anonymous access"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs network access to the ActiveMQ instance and knowledge that the LDAP login module has been misconfigured to use anonymous access. No user credentials needed for exploitation."
