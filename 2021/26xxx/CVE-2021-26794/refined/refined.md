Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:** The root cause is a lack of proper file type validation in the file upload functionality of Frog CMS 0.9.5.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to upload files without sufficient validation of their types. Specifically, the `AllowedFiletype()` function does not perform any file type checking, allowing the upload of arbitrary file types.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP script, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to complete server compromise, including data theft, modification, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File Upload Form:** The attacker utilizes the file upload form within the Frog CMS application to upload a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to the CMS:** The attacker needs to be able to access the file upload functionality of the Frog CMS application, which is likely restricted to authenticated users.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability in the file upload process.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided links to images illustrate the steps of the attack: navigating to the upload function, uploading a PHP script, and demonstrating successful execution.
*   The issue was reported in May 2018, indicating that the vulnerability has been known for some time.
*   The specific location of the vulnerability is within the file upload logic, specifically in the `AllowedFiletype()` function as described in the comment.
