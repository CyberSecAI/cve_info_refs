Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26935:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `event_id` parameter of the `requests.php` file. This parameter is not filtered, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL Injection (SQLi) flaw. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `event_id` parameter, making it possible for an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass normal access controls and directly query the database.
- **Data Breach:** The attacker can potentially access all tables and data stored within the database, which may contain sensitive information, including private user data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a GET request to the `requests.php` file.
- **`event_id` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected via the vulnerable `event_id` parameter in the query string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** An attacker only requires network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic understanding of how to craft HTTP GET requests and how to inject SQL payloads.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in versions of WoWonder Social Network Platform prior to 3.1.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Security For Everyone team.
- The vulnerable parameter `event_id` is used in the `requests.php` page, which handles various function requests.
- The exploit-db entry provides a sample SQLMap command to exploit the vulnerability.
- The vendor has released version 3.1 to address this vulnerability.
