### @ron-checkmarx **[ron-checkmarx](/ron-checkmarx)** commented [Dec 17, 2020](#issue-769943610)

I made the necessary changes to use `execFile` and `execFileSync` instead of `exec` and `execSync` and also added a test to avoid regression.

closes: [#64](https://github.com/domharrington/node-gitlog/issues/64)

# node-gitlog

Git log parser for Node.JS

## Installation

```
npm install gitlog --save
```

## Usage

```
import gitlog from "gitlog";

const options = {
  repo: __dirname + "/test-repo-folder",
  number: 20,
  author: "Dom Harrington",
  fields: ["hash", "abbrevHash", "subject", "authorName", "authorDateRel"],
  execOptions: { maxBuffer: 1000 * 1024 },
};

const commits = await gitlog(options);
```

`gitlog` comes with full typescript support!

```
import gitlog, { GitlogOptions } from "gitlog";

// Option 1: Just use the function, returned commit type has specified fields
gitlog({
  repo: "foo",
  fields: ["subject", "authorName", "authorDate"],
});

// Option 2: Use Options type to create options
const options: GitlogOptions<"subject" | "authorName" | "authorDate"> = {
  repo: "foo",
  fields: ["subject", "authorName", "authorDate"],
};

gitlog(options);

// Option 3: Typescript Magic
const options = {
  repo: "foo",
  fields: ["subject", "authorName", "authorDate"] as const,
};

gitlog(options);

// NOT SUPPORTED: Without "as const" gitlog can't create a good return type
const options = {
  repo: "foo",
  fields: ["subject", "authorName", "authorDate"],
};

gitlog(options);
```

## Options

See [git log](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-log)

### repo

The location of the repo, required field.

### number

The number of commits to return, defaults to 10.

### since/after

Show commits more recent than a specific date.

### until/before

Show commits older than a specific date.

### author/committer

Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer header lines that match the specified pattern.

### nameStatus

Below fields was returned from the log:

* files - changed files names (array)
* status - changed files status (array)

This option is enabled by default.

### findCopiesHarder

Much more likely to set status codes to 'C' if files are exact copies of each other.

This option is disabled by default.

### includeMergeCommitFiles

Pass the `-m` option to includes files in a merge commit.

This option is disabled by default.

### follow

Pass the --follow option to follow files across renames.

This option is disabled by default.

### all

Find commits on all branches instead of just on the current one.

This option is disabled by default.

### branch ([revision range](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#git-log-ltrevisionrangegt))

Show only commits in the specified branch or revision range.

By default uses the current branch and defaults to `HEAD` (i.e. the whole history leading to the current commit).

### fileLineRange

Optional field for getting only the commits that affected a specific line range of a given file.

### file

Optional file filter for the `git log` command

### execOptions

Type: `Object`

Specify some options to be passed to the [.exec()](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback) method:

* `cwd` String *Current working directory of the child process*
* `env` Object *Environment key-value pairs*
* `setsid` Boolean
* `encoding` String *(Default: 'utf8')*
* `timeout` Number *(Default: 0)*
* `maxBuffer` Number *(Default: 200\*1024)*
* `killSignal` String *(Default: 'SIGTERM')*

### optional fields

An array of fields to return from the log, here are the possible options:

* `hash` - the long hash of the commit e.g. 7dd0b07625203f69cd55d779d873f1adcffaa84a
* `abbrevHash` - the abbreviated commit hash e.g. 7dd0b07
* `treeHash` - the tree hash of the commit
* `abbrevTreeHash` - the abbreviated commit hash
* `parentHashes` - the parent hashes
* `abbrevParentHashes` - the abbreviated parent hashes
* `authorName` - author name of the commit
* `authorEmail` - author email of the commit
* `authorDate` - author date of the commit
* `authorDateRel` - relative author date of the commit
* `committerName` - committer name
* `committerEmail` - committer email
* `committerDate` - committer date
* `committerDateRel` - relative committer date
* `subject` - commit message (first line)
* `body` - commit body
* `rawBody` - raw body (subject + body)
* `tag` - raw tag information of commit

Defaults to 'abbrevHash', 'hash', 'subject' and 'authorName'.

## How it works

This module works by executing a child process (using `child_process.exec()`) to the `git` executable, then parsing the stdout into commits. This is done using the `--pretty` command line option which allows you to provide a custom formatter to `git log`. To enable easy parsing the format is delimited by a tab (`\t`) character.

## Example

The following is an example of what a parsed commit might look like.

```
{
  "hash": "6a7ef5e3b3d9c77743140443c8f9e792b0715721",
  "abbrevHash": "6a7ef5e",
  "treeHash": "f1bf51b15b48a00c33727f364afef695029864c0",
  "abbrevTreeHash": "f1bf51b",
  "parentHashes": "cfe06dbdb8d0a193640977e016a04678f8f3b04f",
  "abbrevParentHashes": "cfe06dbdb8d0a193640977e016a04678f8f3b04f",
  "authorName": "Dom Harrington",
  "authorEmail": "dom@harringtonxxxxx",
  "authorDate": "2015-04-09 09:39:23 +0100",
  "authorDateRel": "6 days ago",
  "committerName": "Dom Harrington",
  "committerEmail": "dom@harringtonxxxxx",
  "committerDate": "Thu Apr 9 09:39:23 2015 +0100",
  "committerDateRel": "6 days ago",
  "subject": "1.0.0",
  "status": ["M"],
  "files": ["package.json"]
}
```
