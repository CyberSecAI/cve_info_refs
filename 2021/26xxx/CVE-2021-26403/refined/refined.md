**Summary:**
This document is an AMD Security Bulletin detailing multiple vulnerabilities found in AMD products.  It provides details on the vulnerabilities, affected products, and mitigation steps.

**CVE-2021-26403 Details:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Insufficient checks in SEV (Secure Encrypted Virtualization) may allow a malicious hypervisor to disclose the launch secret, potentially compromising VM confidentiality.
*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability stems from inadequate checks during the SEV launch process, allowing a malicious hypervisor to gain access to sensitive launch secrets.
*  **Impact:** This could lead to a compromise of the confidentiality of the virtual machine. A malicious hypervisor can potentially gain access to the VM's sensitive data and code.
*   **Attack vector:**  A malicious hypervisor can exploit the inadequate checks during the SEV launch process.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have control over the hypervisor to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Severity:** Medium

**Affected Products:**

*   1st Gen AMD EPYC™ Processors
*   2nd Gen AMD EPYC™ Processors

**Mitigation:**
*   Update to the following minimum AGESA™ versions or later:
    *  NaplesPI 1.0.0.E for 1st Gen AMD EPYC™ Processors
    *  RomePI 1.0.0.9 for 2nd Gen AMD EPYC™ Processors
