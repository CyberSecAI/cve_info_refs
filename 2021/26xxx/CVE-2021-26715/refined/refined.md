Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-26715:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of the `logo_uri` parameter in the dynamic client registration process of MITREid Connect. The server fetches the image from the provided URL during the authorization process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The server makes an HTTP request to the URL specified in the `logo_uri` without proper validation, allowing an attacker to make the server request any URL accessible from it.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Because the server does not enforce any image "Content-Type" header, the attacker can provide a URL that returns HTML containing malicious JavaScript code, which will be executed within the context of the authorization server's domain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **SSRF:** An attacker can make the server perform arbitrary HTTP requests to internal or external services, potentially revealing sensitive information or further compromising the system.
- **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that can steal user sessions, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deface the authorization page.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  An attacker registers a new OAuth client application using the dynamic client registration endpoint and provides a malicious URL in the `logo_uri` parameter.
2.  A user attempts to access a resource protected by the newly registered client application which triggers the server to access the malicious URL in the `logo_uri`.
3. The server then makes an HTTP request to the attacker-controlled URL.
4. The response from the malicious URL is processed by the server and either leads to an SSRF or XSS vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the dynamic client registration endpoint, which is publicly accessible.
- The attacker needs a low-privileged user account to access the "/api/clients/{client.id}/logo" endpoint and trigger the SSRF/XSS. This account can be obtained via registration.
- The attacker could also exploit already authenticated users by injecting malicious JavaScript into the authorization flow.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `org.mitre.openid.connect.web.ClientAPI#getClientLogo` method in the MITREid Connect codebase.
- The `client.id` is an incremental integer that is assigned during the client registration process.
- The `logo_uri` is not validated properly prior to being used to make HTTP requests by the server.
