- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Inadequate escaping in the Rules field of the JForm API.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the affected application, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is present in the JForm API's rules field. An attacker would need to input malicious code into this field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would require the ability to input data into the JForm rules field, which would likely require a level of authorization or access to a vulnerable form.
