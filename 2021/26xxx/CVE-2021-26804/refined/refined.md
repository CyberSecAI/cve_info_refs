The provided content describes a vulnerability in Centreon software, specifically version 19.04.0, where arbitrary files can be uploaded to the server by renaming them to a `.gif` extension. This vulnerability is likely related to CVE-2021-26804, which is described as an unrestricted file upload vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly validate file extensions during the upload process in the Administration/Parameters/Images section, allowing users to bypass restrictions by renaming files to have a `.gif` extension.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Unrestricted file upload: The application fails to properly validate uploaded file types.
*   Missing input sanitization: File uploads aren't checked for malicious content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Arbitrary file upload: Attackers can upload malicious scripts, exploits, or other files to the server.
*   Potential privilege escalation: Attackers with limited access can upload files that can then be used to escalate privileges (e.g. by uploading scripts and then executing them).
*   Remote code execution: If an attacker manages to upload a script and execute it they could achieve code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Web interface: The vulnerability is exploited through the application's web interface in the Administration/Parameters/Images section.
*   File upload: The attacker uploads the file through the image upload functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Access to the Centreon administrative console: The attacker must have access to the application's administration console to upload files.
*   Ability to navigate to the Administration/Parameters/Images section: the attacker needs to be authorized to access the vulnerable page of the application.
