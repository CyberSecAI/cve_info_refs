Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `MediaHelper::canUpload` function in Joomla! CMS was missing "html" in its list of blocked file extensions. This oversight allowed users to upload HTML files, which could then be executed by the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to the lack of proper sanitization of uploaded files.
- Inadequate filtering of executable file types.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could upload malicious HTML files containing JavaScript code.
- When a user accessed the uploaded HTML file, the malicious JavaScript could be executed within the user's browser.
- This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, redirect the user to a malicious site, deface the website, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- Uploading a specially crafted HTML file through the media manager or other file upload interfaces.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to upload files to the Joomla! server through a component that utilizes `MediaHelper::canUpload`.
- They do not need to be authenticated as an administrator. A user with sufficient upload privileges in an exploited extension is sufficient.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Joomla! CMS versions 3.0.0 through 3.9.26.
- The fix was implemented in version 3.9.27 by adding `html` to the list of blocked extensions.
- The reported impact was "Low" and Severity was "Low".
- The content provides more information than the basic CVE description.
