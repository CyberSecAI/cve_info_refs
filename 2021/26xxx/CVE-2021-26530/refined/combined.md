### **[cve-reporting](/cve-reporting)** commented [Jan 23, 2021](#issue-792621378) • edited Loading

| Mongoose HTTPS server (compiled with OpenSSL support) is vulnerable to remote OOB write attack via connection request after exhausting memory pool.  Incorrect handling of the value returned by calloc in mg\_tls\_init may lead to:   * out-of-bound write attempt and segmentation fault error in case of restrictive memory protection, * near NULL pointer overwrite in case of limited memory restrictions (e.g. in embedded environments).   Memory allocations are triggered during handling of each HTTPS requests, so the allocation error can be caused remotely by flooding with requests until exhausting the memory. In some embedded environments near zero memory areas are used to store device configuration, so in this case such configuration can be overwritten remotely.  Vulnerable code (mongoose.c):  ``` 3421: struct mg_tls { 3422:   SSL_CTX *ctx; 3423:   SSL *ssl; 3424: };  3442: int mg_tls_init(struct mg_connection *c, struct mg_tls_opts *opts) { 3443:   struct mg_tls *tls = (struct mg_tls *) calloc(1, sizeof(*tls)); printf("tls = %p %ld\n", tls, (long)(&tls->ctx));  3444:   const char *id = "mongoose"; 3445:   static unsigned char s_initialised = 0; 3446:   int rc; 3447:   if (!s_initialised) { 3448:     SSL_library_init(); 3449:    s_initialised++; 3450:   }  3455:   tls->ctx = c->is_client ? SSL_CTX_new(SSLv23_client_method()) 3456:                           : SSL_CTX_new(SSLv23_server_method()); 3457:   if ((tls->ssl = SSL_new(tls->ctx)) == NULL) { 3458:     mg_error(c, "SSL_new"); 3459:     goto fail; 3460:   }  ```  See following recommendations for details (especially the calloc example): [https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/ERR33-C.+Detect+and+handle+standard+library+errors](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/ERR33-C.%2BDetect%2Band%2Bhandle%2Bstandard%2Blibrary%2Berrors)  The issue can be reproduced and tested using ErrorSanitizer (<https://gitlab.com/ErrorSanitizer/ErrorSanitizer>).  Reproduction steps:   0. Install gdb 1. Download and unpack code of ErrorSanitizer (<https://gitlab.com/ErrorSanitizer/ErrorSanitizer>) 2. Perform compilation of ErrorSanitizer according to the manual (<https://gitlab.com/ErrorSanitizer/ErrorSanitizer#compilation>)  cd ErrorSanitizer; make 3. Set ESAN to the path of ErrorSanitizer directory  export ESAN=/opt/... 4. Download and unzip attached map temp\_2.cur\_input    [temp\_2.cur\_input.zip](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose/files/5860691/temp_2.cur_input.zip) 5. Install OpenSSL library 6. Download, unzip and compile mongoose example "http-restful-server" with define OPENSSL\_DIR set for OpenSSL directory and debug symbols (-g) 7. Run Mongoose "http-restful-server" example with ErrorSanitizer in gdb using:  gdb -batch -ex='run' -ex='backtrace' --args env LD\_PRELOAD="$ESAN/error\_sanitizer\_preload.so" ./example temp\_2.cur\_input 8. Open in the browser following URL (where <MONGOOSE\_ADDR> is address of tested Mongoose instance):  https://<MONGOOSE\_ADDR>:8000   You should receive similar output:  ``` process 10544 is executing new program: mongoose/examples/http-restful-server-openssl/example [Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled] Using host libthread_db library "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libthread_db.so.1". 2021-01-21 00:00:00  I sock.c:461:mg_listen      1 accepting on https://localhost:8000  Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. 0x0000555555560d6a in mg_tls_init (c=0x555555768780, opts=0x7fffffffdbf0) at src/tls.c:209 209	src/tls.c: No such file or directory. #0  0x0000555555560d6a in mg_tls_init (c=0x555555768780, opts=0x7fffffffdbf0) at src/tls.c:209 #1  0x0000555555563860 in fn (c=0x555555768780, ev=4, ev_data=0x0, fn_data=0x0) at main.c:28 #2  0x0000555555557d11 in mg_call (c=0x555555768780, ev=4, ev_data=0x0) at src/event.c:9 #3  0x000055555555fa1d in accept_conn (mgr=0x7fffffffdd10, lsn=0x555555769500) at src/sock.c:398 #4  0x00005555555603bd in mg_mgr_poll (mgr=0x7fffffffdd10, ms=1000) at src/sock.c:551 #5  0x00005555555639bb in main () at main.c:49  ``` |
