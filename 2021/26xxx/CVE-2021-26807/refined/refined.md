Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26807:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a DLL load order hijacking issue in GOG Galaxy version 2.0.35. The application attempts to load the `ZLIB1.dll` library from a user-writable directory: `C:\Users\(username)\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **DLL Load Order Hijacking:** GOG Galaxy searches for the `ZLIB1.dll` in a predictable order, including a location where a standard user can write files. This allows a malicious actor to place a specially crafted DLL in this directory and have it loaded by the GOG Galaxy application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By placing a malicious `ZLIB1.dll` file, the attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the GOG Galaxy process.
- **Privilege Escalation (Potentially):**  While the initial exploitation occurs at the user level, the document mentions that the GOG update service runs with SYSTEM level permissions. The researchers hypothesized that if the malicious DLL could be triggered by the update service, it could lead to privilege escalation, although they couldn't achieve it directly in their tests.
- **Malware Delivery:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to deliver malware, including ransomware, that would run with the privileges of the logged-in user.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **File System Write:** The attacker needs write access to the directory `C:\Users\(username)\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\`. This is a standard user-writable location on Windows.
- **DLL Placement:** The attacker must create a malicious DLL file (named `ZLIB1.dll`) and place it in the vulnerable directory before GOG Galaxy loads it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Standard User Access:** The attacker needs to have a standard user account on a system where the vulnerable version of GOG Galaxy is installed.
- **Ability to write to the file system**: The attacker must be able to write to the `C:\Users\(username)\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\` directory.
- **Malicious DLL creation**: The attacker must be able to create a malicious DLL that would be executed by the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was discovered while attempting to remove the "Folding at Home" client.
- The vendor was notified of the vulnerability on Jan 25, 2021, and released a patch (version 2.0.37) on March 30, 2021.
- The researchers were unable to find a way to elevate to SYSTEM level but note that this does not make the vulnerability any less severe, because it still allows for malware to be executed.
