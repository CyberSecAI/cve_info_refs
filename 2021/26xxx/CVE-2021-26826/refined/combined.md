| Hello [@hpvb](https://github.com/hpvb) [@akien-mga](https://github.com/akien-mga) As Godot Engine is a leading open source project for game development, I was thinking it would be appropriate to provide some additional assurance to the community regarding quality and security best practices of the project. Recently, this is a key factor for companies/development teams when choosing their technology stack.  As an initial step the project could adopt something like <https://securitytxt.org>, do and document security reviews and other activities.  What do you think? I am myself willing to support these initiatives. Looking forward to hear your thoughts. |
