Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by an SQL injection flaw in the login functionality of the Library System version 1.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `student` parameter in the `login.php` script. This allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query used for authentication.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** By injecting a crafted SQL payload (`'or 1 or'`), an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain access to the application as a privileged user.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker access to the student area as a privileged user, potentially gaining access to sensitive student information and system functionalities.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `login.php` endpoint with the vulnerable `student` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application server where the Library System is hosted.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must know the vulnerable parameter ('student') in the login form.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests, which can be accomplished through tools like `curl` or with a script like the python one provided.

**More Details than CVE:**
*   The provided information gives details on the specific SQL injection payload and how to exploit the vulnerability using a python script to automate the process.
