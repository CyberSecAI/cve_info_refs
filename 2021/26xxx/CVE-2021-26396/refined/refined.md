The provided content is related to CVE-2021-26396.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient validation of address mapping to I/O in the AMD Secure Processor (ASP).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient validation of address mappings.
- Improper handling of I/O address mappings.

**Impact of exploitation:** Loss of memory integrity in the Secure Nested Paging (SNP) guest.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation of the vulnerability would require a malicious actor to have control over the address mapping within the ASP.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to manipulate or influence the I/O address mapping within the ASP.
- The attacker needs to be in a position to control aspects of the system related to the AMD Secure Processor (ASP). This likely means the attacker has to have some level of privilege or control over the system's firmware or hypervisor.

**Additional notes:**
- This vulnerability affects systems using AMD's Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP) technology.
- The vulnerability is mitigated in the AGESA MilanPI-SP3_1.0.0.9 package.
