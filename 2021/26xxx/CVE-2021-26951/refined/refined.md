- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `Sectors::get` function in the calamine crate uses `Vec::set_len` to increase the length of a vector without allocating new memory. Subsequently, it reads from this uninitialized memory using a user-provided `Read` operation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Accessing uninitialized memory
    - Use of `Vec::set_len` to expand a vector beyond its allocated capacity without allocating more memory.
    - Calling user provided Read on uninitialized memory which is undefined behaviour (UB) in Rust.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Overwriting of active entities in adjacent heap memory leading to potential corruption of data structures
    - General undefined behavior
    - High impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Network based attack, exploiting an application that uses a vulnerable version of the calamine crate.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No special privileges or user interaction is needed. An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted input (an excel file) to a service using the vulnerable calamine crate to trigger the vulnerability.
