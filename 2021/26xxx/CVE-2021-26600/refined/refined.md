Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-26600

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `autologin.php` script within ImpressCMS.
- The script uses the `!=` operator for comparing a generated hash with a provided hash from a cookie. This operator performs type coercion before comparison, unlike the strict `!==` operator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The use of the loose comparison operator (`!=`) instead of the strict comparison operator (`!==`) in the password verification logic allows an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially log in as any user without knowing the user's password.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to the system, data breaches, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through specially crafted `autologin_uname` and `autologin_pass` cookie values.
- The vulnerable code is located in the `/plugins/preloads/autologin.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to set cookie values in the user's browser to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker must be aware of the target system using ImpressCMS 1.4.2 or prior.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is due to the comparison operator `!=` allowing for type juggling during comparison, which can be exploited.
- The fix involves changing the comparison operator to the strict comparison operator `!==`.
- The vulnerability was fixed in ImpressCMS version 1.4.3.
