Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-26472:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the HTTP API located at `/consumerweb/secure/download.php` in VembuBDR and VembuOffsiteDR products installed on Windows.
- The `Action` parameter within the `download.php` script is vulnerable to command injection. Specifically, the `ResellerTemplate` action can be manipulated to execute arbitrary operating system commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands without needing to authenticate to the application.
- **Command Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input (`accountID` parameter), allowing the attacker to inject OS commands.
- **Lack of Input Validation:**  The `accountID` parameter does not undergo sufficient input validation or sanitization to prevent command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- **Full System Compromise:** Due to the commands being executed with SYSTEM privileges, attackers gain complete control over the affected machine.
- **Data Access:** Attackers can access data backed up by the Vembu BDR system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `/consumerweb/secure/download.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Vembu server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable URL is `/consumerweb/secure/download.php`.
- The `Action` parameter should be set to `ResellerTemplate`.
- The `accountID` parameter is used to inject OS commands.
- The injected commands are executed with SYSTEM privileges.

**Example Exploit (from provided content):**

```
curl 'http://local/consumerweb/secure/download.php?Action=ResellerTemplate&accountID=%26whoami'
```
This example injects the `whoami` command, demonstrating successful RCE.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- VembuBDR before 4.2.0.1
- VembuOffsiteDR before 4.2.0.1
- It is also likely other related Vembu products are affected

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Vembu BDR version 4.2.0 update 2 or later.
- Limit the exposure of Vembu products, and do not expose them to the public internet. Use a VPN or access gateway for access.
