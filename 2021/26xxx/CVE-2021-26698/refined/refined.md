Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-26698:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **MWB-838:** A legacy component ("dataretrieval"), disabled by default, lacked proper sanitization and output filtering, allowing the execution of script code.
*  **MWB-839:** A URL parameter could be used to bypass existing sanitization and output handling, when downloading user-generated content.
*  **OXUIB-645:** The "app loader" mechanism in the frontend component could be abused to load content from relative URLs, outside of the intended code loading API path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-80):** Multiple instances of XSS vulnerabilities were identified due to improper sanitization and filtering of user-provided data in different components.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Script Execution:** Attackers can inject and execute malicious script code within a user's context.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Successful exploitation could lead to session hijacking, allowing attackers to take over user accounts.
*  **Unwanted Actions:** Attackers can trigger unwanted actions via the web interface, such as redirecting users to third-party sites or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct References:** Attackers can distribute direct references to vulnerable endpoints or content.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers may use social engineering tactics to trick victims into clicking on malicious links.
*   **Malicious Links:** Embedding malicious script code in a URL or crafting malicious links to be followed by a victim.
*   **Uploaded Content:** Uploading malicious content such as files containing script code

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **MWB-838:** Requires operator access to enable the vulnerable "dataretrieval" component. Attacker also needs to upload malicious binary data and distribute a reference to it
*   **MWB-839:** Requires the attacker to upload content and create a sharing link, then modify the URL parameters to exploit the vulnerability.
*  **OXUIB-645**: Requires the attacker to upload content and create a sharing link, then modify the "app loader" URL to include a relative reference to the shared code snippet.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation often requires the victim to click on a link or view specially crafted content.
*   **Privileges:** Some vulnerabilities require low privilege access or no privileges

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerabilities were fixed in versions 7.10.3-rev32, 7.10.4-rev18 for the backend components, and 7.10.3-rev27, 7.10.4-rev19 for the frontend component
*   The vulnerabilities were publicly disclosed on 2021-07-15.
