- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `postscript` crate passes an uninitialized buffer to a user-provided `Read` implementation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Reading from an uninitialized buffer can lead to memory exposure, where the user-provided `Read` implementation can access arbitrary data from the buffer.
    - The `Read` implementation can also return an incorrect number of bytes read, which could cause further issues.
    - Reading from uninitialized memory results in undefined behavior.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Exploitation can lead to memory exposure and potentially other undefined behaviors. Specifically, the confidentiality of the application's memory can be compromised through the exposure of the uninitialized buffer.
- **Attack vectors**: Network. The vulnerability can be triggered via a network request that invokes the vulnerable function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction to trigger the vulnerability. The attack has low complexity and can be carried out remotely.
