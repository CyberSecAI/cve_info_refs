Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-26833:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The TimelyBills application for both iOS (<= 1.7.0) and Android (<= 1.21.115) stores JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication tokens in a local file within the app directory without sufficient cache clearing mechanisms. These tokens are used for authentication and authorization.
*   The tokens do not expire and remain in the local directory even after the user logs out of the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Storage:** The JWT tokens are stored in cleartext on the file system, making them easily accessible to anyone with access to the device's file system.
*   **Insufficient Cache Clearing:** The application fails to properly clear or invalidate the stored JWT tokens upon logout, leaving them vulnerable even after a user is no longer actively using the application.
*   **Lack of Encryption:** The tokens are not encrypted, only signed and encoded, which means the information within the token can be easily decoded and read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who gains local access to the device's file system can read the stored JWT tokens.
*   **Account Hijacking:**  By using the stolen JWT tokens, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the victim's TimelyBills account and perform actions as the victim without requiring the user's credentials again.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The attacker can decode the JWT token and potentially reveal sensitive user information contained within it.
*   **Malicious App Abuse:** If a malicious application is installed on the same device, it could potentially access the TimelyBills appâ€™s directory and steal the JWT tokens.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local File System Access:** The primary attack vector is through local access to the device's file system, either by physical access or through malware.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs local access to the device's file system. This could be achieved through:
    *   Direct physical access to the device.
    *   Compromising the device through malware.
    *   Gaining access through a rooted or jailbroken device.
*   The attacker needs the ability to read files within the TimelyBills application's directory.

**Additional Information:**

*   The article also highlights other security flaws in the TimelyBills application, including an account takeover vulnerability through password reset manipulation and the ability to upload malicious files to the server, but these issues are unrelated to CVE-2021-26833.
*   The vendor was notified of these issues but did not respond or apply fixes in a timely manner, leading to public disclosure after the CVE was assigned.
