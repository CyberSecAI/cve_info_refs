### **[renniepak](/renniepak)** commented [Feb 5, 2021](#issue-802105883)

| Hi!  I've found a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in Oncall's search bar. I've reported this issue to the LinkedIn Information Security Response Center back in September 2020 but Oncall still seems vulnerable to this date. Therefore I decided to report it here. Reproduction  1. Navigate to `http://[OnCallHost]/query/%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=alert(document.domain)%3E/all` 2. Click on the search bar where it now says `<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>`  Result By clicking the search bar, a search will be done to the search API endpoint. Because nothing can be found a `No results found for "<img src="x" onerror="alert(document.domain)">"` message will be shown. Because this message includes the search query and lacks the proper HTML output encoding, the query is interpreted as HTML/JS and an alert containing the `document.domain` is shown.  [Screenshot 2021-02-05 at 12 38 22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26874824/107029951-29e96a00-67b0-11eb-99bc-62bde5931a2a.png) Impact If an attacker can control a script that is executed in the victim's browser, then they can typically fully compromise that user. Amongst other things, the attacker can:   * Steal the user's credentials by altering the working of the displayed login form. * Perform any action within the application that the user can perform. * View any information that the user is able to view. * Modify any information that the user is able to modify.  Mitigation In general, effectively preventing XSS vulnerabilities is likely to involve a combination of the following measures:   * **Filter input on arrival.** At the point where user input is received, filter as strictly as possible based on what is expected or valid input. * **Encode data on output.** At the point where user-controllable data is output in HTTP responses, encode the output to prevent it from being interpreted as active content. Depending on the output context, this might require applying combinations of HTML, URL, JavaScript, and CSS encoding. * **Content Security Policy.** As a last line of defense, you could use a (default) Content Security Policy (CSP) to reduce the severity of any XSS vulnerabilities that still occur. |
