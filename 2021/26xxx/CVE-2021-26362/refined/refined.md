Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-26362:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A malicious or compromised User Application (UApp) or AGESA Boot Loader (ABL) can exploit a vulnerability in the system call handling of the AMD Secure Processor (ASP) bootloader.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation when processing system calls by the ASP bootloader.
- Specifically, a malformed system call can be crafted by a compromised UApp or ABL, leading to incorrect mapping of sensitive System Management Network (SMN) registers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation can lead to a loss of integrity and availability of the system.
- By mapping sensitive SMN registers, an attacker could potentially manipulate or interfere with critical system functions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves using a malicious or compromised UApp or AGESA Boot Loader (ABL) running on the system.
- The attacker would need to inject a crafted system call to the ASP bootloader.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have compromised a User Application (UApp) or the AGESA Boot Loader (ABL).
- This implies the attacker may require elevated privileges or the ability to inject code into these components.
