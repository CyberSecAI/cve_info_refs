Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-26843:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of `strcpy` within the `de_dotdot` function of `libhttpd.c` in `sthttpd`. Specifically, when `strcpy` is implemented using `memcpy` (as is the case on GLIBC and macOS), it can lead to memory corruption or a crash due to overlapping memory ranges being passed to `memcpy`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper use of `strcpy`:** The `strcpy` function is used with potentially overlapping source and destination memory regions.
- **Reliance on `memcpy` Implementation:** The vulnerability is triggered because certain systems implement `strcpy` using `memcpy`, which is not safe for overlapping memory ranges.
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** Although not directly stated as such in the description, the overlapping memory copy can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow and memory corruption.
- **CWE-119**: This vulnerability relates to improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate and likely impact is a denial-of-service, causing the `sthttpd` daemon to crash. This can disrupt the service provided by the server.
- **Memory corruption:** Overlapping memory copies can lead to unpredictable program behavior, and potentially to remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request with a malicious filename containing sequences like `//../`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable server.
- **No Authentication Required:**  The vulnerability can be triggered without any form of authentication.
- **Low Attack Complexity:** The vulnerability is easy to exploit with basic network tools, crafting the payload in the GET request.
