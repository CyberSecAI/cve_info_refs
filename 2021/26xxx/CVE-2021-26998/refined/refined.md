- **Root cause of vulnerability:** NetApp Cloud Manager versions prior to 3.9.9 log sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive information disclosure through logging.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access, potentially through the web interface of the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the NetApp Cloud Manager. It also requires a high level of access complexity with some user interaction.
