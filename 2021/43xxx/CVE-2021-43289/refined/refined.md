{
  "CVE-2021-43289": {
    "Root cause": "Path Traversal vulnerability due to insufficient validation of the `stageCounter` parameter during artifact upload.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary file write on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution. Attackers could overwrite existing files, modify existing application files to include backdoors, leak API keys to external services, steal private source code, and get access to production environments.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "By impersonating a build agent, attackers can send a crafted HTTP PUT request to the `/go/remoting/files/` endpoint with malicious values for `stageCounter`, leading to writing files to arbitrary locations outside of intended artifact directory."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Requires the ability to impersonate a GoCD build agent (CVE-2021-43287)."
  }
