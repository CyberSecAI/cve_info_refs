Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-43810

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper validation of the `url` parameter within the `redirect.php` file. The application attempts to validate the URL using `filter_var($getUrl, FILTER_VALIDATE_URL)`, but this check is insufficient to prevent XSS attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where a malicious script is injected through the URL parameter.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application's input validation logic does not adequately sanitize or validate the URL, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code. Specifically, the code failed to consider javascript://%0A as an invalid URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable Admidio web application. This can lead to various malicious actions such as:
  - Stealing user session cookies or other sensitive information.
  - Defacing the website.
  - Redirecting users to phishing sites.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL Parameter:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in the url parameter, which is then reflected in the response without proper sanitization. For example, using the payload `javascript://%0A`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and deliver a malicious URL to a user of the Admidio application. This could be achieved through various means such as:
  - Sending a malicious link via email or social media.
  - Embedding the link on a compromised website.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by @P0cas
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.0.12 of Admidio.
- The commit `fcb0609abc1d2f65bc1377866bd678e5d891404b` introduced a change in the validation of URLs in the `adm_program/system/classes/StringUtils.php` file and `adm_program/system/redirect.php` file.
- The commit `c043267d362f7813543cc2785119bf3e3e54fe21` merged the fix.
- The fix involved modifying the regex used for validating URL strings in the `StringUtils::strValidCharacters` function, and changing the order of validation in `redirect.php`.
