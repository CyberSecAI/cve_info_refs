Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue in the `/static-files/{path}` endpoint. The application uses `os.path.join` to construct the path to static files based on user-supplied input, without proper sanitization or validation. This allows attackers to inject path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files outside of the intended `ui/build` directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper path sanitization, which allows an attacker to manipulate the `{path}` parameter to navigate the file system beyond the webroot.
*   **Insecure Path Construction:** The use of `os.path.join` without validation in the original vulnerable code makes it susceptible to path traversal attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** A successful path traversal attack can allow an attacker to read any file on the server that the web server process has permission to access. This includes sensitive files such as application source code, configuration files, and potentially critical system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`). This could lead to information disclosure or further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious HTTP request to the `/static-files/{path}` endpoint with a manipulated `path` parameter containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `/static-files/../../../../etc/passwd`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special privileges or user interaction are required, meaning any user with network access to the application can exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was identified by `haby0` and the fix was implemented by `mihran113`.
*   The fix involves checking if the resolved path is within the intended `ui/build` directory.
*   The issue was resolved by replacing the usage of `os.path.join` with `str.join` which appears to be a separate issue related to the behavior of `os.path.join` when the input starts with `/` or `\`.
*  The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2021-43775 with a CVSS score of 7.1 (High)
* The vulnerability is also tracked as GHSA-8phj-f9w2-cjcc.
* The affected versions were <=3.0.6 and patched in 3.1.0
