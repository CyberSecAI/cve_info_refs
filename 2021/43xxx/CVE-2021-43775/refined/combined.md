### Impact

A path traversal attack aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. By manipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system including application source code or configuration and critical system files.

Vulnerable code:

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Fix security issue when incorrect path is given to the endpoint that serves static files which can lead to a leak of files (e.g. `/static-files/../../../../etc/passwd`)

| If you use `os.path.join(static_file_root, path)` to join the path, the `path` parameter value cannot have `/` or `\\`, Otherwise, the request will definitely make the result of `if` judgment as `True`. |

I think you meant that if the `path` starts with `/` or `\\` then `os.path.join` won't work as expected. Yeah, that's a valid concern, but our UI handles that. Anyways will change that with usual join to avoid any failures. Thanks for the comment. |
