Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a change in how `PathAndQuery` handles `%2F` (encoded `/`) in version 1.12.0 of the Armeria library. This change, introduced in pull request #3855, intended to prevent decoding `%2F` into `/` in request paths. However, it inadvertently created a loophole in the double-dot (`..`) detection logic. Specifically, the library did not correctly handle cases where double dots were combined with encoded forward slashes like `..%2F`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue. The improper handling of `%2F` in conjunction with double-dot sequences allowed attackers to bypass directory restrictions and access files outside the intended scope.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker could access sensitive files on the server's local filesystem that were meant to be protected by the Armeria server's file service. This would allow an attacker to potentially read configuration files, source code, or other sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is through specially crafted HTTP requests. The attacker sends a request with a path that includes double-dots (`..`) and URL-encoded forward slashes (`%2F`), such as `/files/..%2Fsecrets.txt`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Armeria server. No special privileges or user interaction are required.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Abdallah Zaher ([elcayser-0x0a](https://hackerone.com/elcayser-0x0a?type=user)).
- The vulnerability is fixed in Armeria version 1.13.4 and later, which includes a fix to harden the double-dot detection logic in `PathAndQuery`.
- A workaround was suggested: adding a decorator to the file service that checks for the presence of `%2F` or `%2f` in the request path and return a 400 error.
- The fix involved splitting `ArmeriaHttpUtil.decodePath()` into `decodePath()` and `decodePathParam()`. `decodePath()` no longer decodes `%2F`, while `decodePathParam()` does.
