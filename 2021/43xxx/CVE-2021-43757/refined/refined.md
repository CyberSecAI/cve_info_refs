Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-43757:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The software reads data past the end of the intended buffer. This is a classic out-of-bounds read vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution. An attacker could potentially leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs local access to the vulnerable system.
- No special privileges are required (PR:N), and user interaction is required (UI:R), implying that the user would likely need to open a malicious file or perform some other triggering action.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the vulnerable system. The attacker also needs to be able to entice the user to perform a triggering action, such as opening a specially crafted malicious file.

**CVSS Vector:**
