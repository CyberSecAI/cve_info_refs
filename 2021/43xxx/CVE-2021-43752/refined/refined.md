- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the program tries to access memory outside of the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), and requires user interaction (UI:R). The attacker needs to have some form of access to the system but does not need privileges (PR:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system and needs to convince the user to open a malicious file, triggering the vulnerability.
