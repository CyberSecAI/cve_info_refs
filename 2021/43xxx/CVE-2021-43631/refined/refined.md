Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is an SQL injection in the `payment.php` file. The `appointment_no` parameter is used directly in an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application constructs a SQL query by directly concatenating user-supplied input (`appointment_no`) into a query string, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data in the database, including patient information, appointment details, and potentially other confidential data.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could modify or delete data, causing disruptions and potentially altering the integrity of the system.
*   **System Control:** In some cases, SQL injection can lead to the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker could extract information about the database structure and version.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP GET request to `payment.php` with a crafted `appointment_no` parameter.
*   **Parameter Injection:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `appointment_no` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server where the vulnerable application is hosted.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs some knowledge of SQL and SQL injection techniques to craft malicious payloads.
*   **Authentication (Clerk Level):** The attacker needs valid credentials to log in as a clerk in the application to reach the vulnerable functionality
* **Request Interception:** The attacker intercepts and modifies the request to insert malicious payloads into the value of the `appointment_no` parameter.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable code in `payment.php` directly includes the `appointment_no` parameter in the SQL query.
*   The file `library.php` is also mentioned, which contains a function used in the vulnerable code. However, the vulnerability is a result of the use of the parameter in the SQL query, not specifically the function itself.
*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) includes examples of boolean-based, time-based, and UNION-based SQL injection payloads.
*   The PoC demonstrates how an attacker can extract database version information using a UNION-based SQL injection.
