  "CVE-2021-43546": {
    "Description": "It was possible to recreate previous cursor spoofing attacks against users with a zoomed native cursor.",
    "Root cause": "The browser's defense against large spoofed cursors did not account for users who have increased their OS cursor size for accessibility reasons.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate input validation",
      "UI spoofing vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "A spoofed cursor could overlay the user interface, potentially misleading the user about the location of clicks and actions.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious website could craft a large custom cursor and use the OS scaling to make it overlay the browser chrome or address bar.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to serve the malicious website to the victim."
