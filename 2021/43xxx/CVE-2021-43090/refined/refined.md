Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the XXE vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the usage of `XMLInputFactory` to parse XML files (specifically WSDL files). By default, `XMLInputFactory` allows the loading of Document Type Definitions (DTDs), which can lead to XML External Entity (XXE) injection.

**Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses:**
- The code was using `XMLInputFactory.newInstance().createXMLStreamReader(resource)` directly, without disabling external entity processing.
- The `Include.groovy` file in `core/src/main/groovy/com/predic8/schema/` and `AbstractParser.groovy` in `core/src/main/groovy/com/predic8/soamodel/` were vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform an XXE attack, potentially leading to:
  - Information disclosure by reading local files on the server.
  - Denial of Service (DoS) by triggering excessive processing of external entities.
  - Potentially other impacts depending on the server configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker provides a malicious WSDL file. The WSDL file includes a doctype that references an external DTD. This DTD is hosted on a server controlled by the attacker. The DTD contains entity definitions to read local files and send the file content to an attacker controlled server.
- Specifically, the parsing of the WSDL file using `WSDLParser` is the entry point for the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious WSDL file to be parsed by the vulnerable application. In the provided example the attacker hosts the malicious WSDL file on a server and the vulnerable code parses the remote WSDL file.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in `soa-model-core` versions prior to 1.6.4
- The vulnerable code snippets are located in `core/src/main/groovy/com/predic8/schema/Include.groovy` and `core/src/main/groovy/com/predic8/soamodel/AbstractParser.groovy`.
- The fix involves creating a new `XMLInputFactory`, disabling `IS_REPLACING_ENTITY_REFERENCES` and `IS_SUPPORTING_EXTERNAL_ENTITIES` properties and then creating the XMLStreamReader with this new factory.
- The vulnerable code in `Include.groovy` was:
   ```groovy
   def incToken = XMLInputFactory.newInstance().createXMLStreamReader(resource)
   ```
- The fix in `Include.groovy` is:
    ```groovy
     def inputFactory = XMLInputFactory.newInstance()
     inputFactory.setProperty(XMLInputFactory.IS_REPLACING_ENTITY_REFERENCES, false)
     inputFactory.setProperty(XMLInputFactory.IS_SUPPORTING_EXTERNAL_ENTITIES, false)
     def incToken = inputFactory.createXMLStreamReader(resource)
    ```
- The vulnerable code in `AbstractParser.groovy` was:
   ```groovy
    XMLInputFactory.newInstance().createXMLStreamReader(res)
   ```
- The fix in `AbstractParser.groovy` is:
    ```groovy
    def inputFactory = XMLInputFactory.newInstance()
    inputFactory.setProperty(XMLInputFactory.IS_REPLACING_ENTITY_REFERENCES, false)
    inputFactory.setProperty(XMLInputFactory.IS_SUPPORTING_EXTERNAL_ENTITIES, false)
    inputFactory.createXMLStreamReader(res)
   ```
