Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user input when registering an account in the iResturant ERP system. Specifically, the application does not sanitize the `name` field during user registration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS because it stores user-provided data (specifically the name field) in a database without sanitizing it. When this data is later displayed to other users or the same user, the malicious script is executed within the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Theft:** Successful exploitation can lead to the theft of a user's cookies.
*   **Account Hijacking:** By stealing cookies, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the victim's account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the user registration form. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `name` field when creating a new account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to access the user registration form. No special privileges or network position is needed to carry out the attack.
*   The attacker needs to be able to create an account using a crafted name field, they only require access to the user registration page.

**Additional details:**
The provided write-up shows the steps to reproduce the vulnerability, by injecting a script tag as the username, thus demonstrating the stored XSS.
