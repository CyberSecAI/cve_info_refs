# Code injection via unsafe YAML loading

Moderate

[mjdenkowski](/mjdenkowski)
published
GHSA-ggmr-44cv-24pm
Dec 8, 2021

## Package

pip

sockeye
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.3.24

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

Sockeye uses YAML to store model and data configurations on disk. Versions below 2.3.24 use unsafe YAML loading, which can be made to execute arbitrary code embedded in config files.

An attacker can add malicious code to the config file of a trained model and attempt to convince users to download and run it. If users run the model, the embedded code will run locally.

### Patches

The issue is fixed in version 2.3.24 and above by [#964](https://github.com/awslabs/sockeye/pull/964).

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [awslabs/sockeye](https://github.com/awslabs/sockeye)
* Email us at sockeye-dev

### Attribution

This vulnerability was reported by Masatoshi Yoshizawa of yamory Security Team.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-43811

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

With this change we make use of the safe yaml loader that only accepts our own defined types and the standard yaml types. Additionally, we make sure to be able load tuples (which are used for buckets and some other parts of the config).
