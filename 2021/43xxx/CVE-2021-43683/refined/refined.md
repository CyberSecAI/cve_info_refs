Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-43683:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `api/info.php` file of pictshare v1.5. Specifically, the `exit` function is used to terminate the script, and it directly prints the value of `$_REQUEST['hash']` within a JSON encoded response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The script directly outputs user-supplied input (`$_REQUEST['hash']`) into the JSON response without proper sanitization or encoding. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when accessing the vulnerable `api/info.php` endpoint. This could lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Stealing cookies
  - Defacing the website
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript in the `hash` parameter of a GET request to `api/info.php`.
    - Example: `https://pictshare.net/api/info.php?hash=<script>alert('xss')</script>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL with malicious code in the `hash` parameter.
- The attacker can be an external, unauthenticated user as the endpoint is publicly accessible.
- No specific user privileges are required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists because the application directly prints the `$_REQUEST['hash']` value without encoding it for safe output within a JSON context.
- The initial report mentioned that if a valid hash was not provided, a file not found error would be returned.  However, it was later shown that specific crafted values could bypass this and trigger the XSS.
- The vulnerability was present in pictshare v1.5, which was released in 2018.
