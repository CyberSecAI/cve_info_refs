# AppResponse User Credentials Included in Log Files (CVE-2021-43271)

* Print

Categories:

[AppResponse Cloud](index?page=browsecategory&cat=STEELCENTRAL_APPRESPONSE_CLOUD), [AppResponse 11](index?page=browsecategory&cat=STEELCENTRAL_APPRESPONSE_11)

Solution Number:

S35806

Last Modified:

2022-06-03

![](apps/infocenter/resources/images/uirevamp/issue.svg)
###### Issue

**Description**

Riverbed AppResponse (when configured to use local, RADIUS, or TACACS authentication) logs usernames and passwords if either is entered incorrectly. If a user enters an incorrect username and/or password when logging into the WebUI, these attempted credentials are included in an error message that is logged in the WebUI log file. A log entry does not appear if the username and password provided correctly match a valid set of credentials. This also does not happen if AppResponse is configured to use SAML authentication. The WebUI log file is included in subsequent diagnostic system dumps that are generated. (Only users with Full Control access to the System Configuration permission can generate system dumps. By default, only System Administrators have Full Control access to the System Configuration permission.)

[CVE-2021-43271](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-43271)

**Severity**: Low

**Vulnerablity Type**: Insecure Permissions

**Versions Affected**: 11.8.0, 11.8.5, 11.8.5a, 11.9.0, 11.9.0a, 11.10.0, 11.11.0, 11.11.0a, 11.11.1, 11.11.1a, 11.11.5, and 11.11.5a

**Affected Component**: system diagonostic log files

**Impacts**: Escalation of Privileges and Information Disclosure

**Attack Vectors**: after a failed login, someone must generate and collect a system dump, which by default requires admin access, and then look in the log files for the mistyped username and/or password

![](apps/infocenter/resources/images/uirevamp/solution.svg)
###### Solution

**Mitigation**

The vulnerability has been fixed in Riverbed AppResponse versions 11.11.6 and 11.12.0 and later. They are available for download on the [Riverbed Support Portal](https://support.riverbed.com/content/support/software/steelcentral-npm/appresponse-ar11.html).

**Credit**

None

**Environment**

Riverbed AppResponse appliances (including virtual appliances) and AppResponse Cloud
