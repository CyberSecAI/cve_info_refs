- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect handling of failed login attempts, where the system logs the entered (incorrect) username and password in the WebUI log file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure logging practices, specifically including sensitive user credentials in log files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure of user credentials, potentially leading to privilege escalation if the disclosed credentials are used on other systems.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - A failed login attempt to the WebUI of AppResponse.
    - An attacker needs to generate a system diagnostic dump that includes the web UI log file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    -  The attacker needs to cause a failed login attempt to the system.
    - The attacker needs to have system admin or equivalent access to generate system diagnostic dumps.
    - The attacker needs to access and inspect log files within the diagnostic dump.
