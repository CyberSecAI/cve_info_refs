  "CVE-2021-43141": {
    "description": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Sourcecodester Simple Subscription Website 1.0 via the id parameter in plan_application and users_application. The attacker can use SQL - Injection bypass Authentication method to log in to the admin account of the system and then he can exploit this account by using XSS-Stored to attack and exploit the account, and then he can use remote requests to hijack PHPSESSID and can exploit this account and users into it by using an XSS-Stored method! Conclusion: The status of this system is CRITICAL and awful, and this must be stopped immediately for distribution!",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of the `id` parameter in the `plan_application` and `users_application` pages, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
         "SQL Injection (for admin bypass)"

      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities. Additionally, they can bypass admin authentication, gain access to the admin panel, and then further exploit XSS vulnerabilities to take over accounts.",
      "attack_vectors": [
       "The XSS vulnerability is exploitable via a crafted request to the vulnerable pages with malicious scripts in the id parameter.",
        "SQL Injection to bypass admin authentication."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable website. Additionally, they need SQL injection skills to bypass admin login.",
      "attacker_position": "Remote attacker"
    },
    "affected_product": {
      "name": "Sourcecodester Simple Subscription Website",
      "version": "1.0"
    },
  "remediation": "Proper sanitization of input parameters, especially in the `id` parameter in the `plan_application` and `users_application` pages, is needed. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. Implement strong password policies, session management, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) prevention techniques"
