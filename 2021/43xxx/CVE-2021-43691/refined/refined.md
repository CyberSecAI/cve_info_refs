{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in the `file system/helpers/dompdf/load_font.php` file of the `tripexpress` application. The script uses the `$_SERVER['argv']` variable to obtain the source file path for font installation. This allows attackers to manipulate the file path and potentially overwrite arbitrary files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path manipulation vulnerability (CWE-22)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially overwrite arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the `src` variable in the `copy()` function.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker would need to pass malicious input to the `$_SERVER['argv']` variable, which is typically accessible when running a PHP script from the command line.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to execute the PHP script with the ability to control command-line arguments."
