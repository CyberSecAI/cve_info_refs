Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-43024:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an "Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer". This indicates a buffer overflow or out-of-bounds write condition where the program attempts to access memory beyond the allocated buffer.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is the "Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer" (CWE-788).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution. This means an attacker could potentially run malicious code on the affected system, gaining control and potentially causing significant harm.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The document doesn't specify the exact attack vector. However, it's implied that a crafted input to Adobe Premiere Rush can trigger the buffer overflow.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need to be able to supply the crafted input that leads to the out-of-bounds memory access. This could likely occur through malicious files or potentially network-based attacks, though not specified here.

In summary, CVE-2021-43024 involves a critical buffer overflow vulnerability in Adobe Premiere Rush that could enable arbitrary code execution.
