The content is related to CVE-2021-43156.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `admin_delete.php` script lacks CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to trigger a book deletion by crafting a malicious link.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. The application does not implement any anti-CSRF tokens or checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can delete any book from the online book store if they can entice a logged-in admin user to visit a malicious link.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a link to the `admin_delete.php` script with a specific `bookisbn` parameter and then tricks a logged-in admin into visiting the page. The link can be embedded within an <a> tag and automatically clicked using Javascript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page and to trick a logged-in admin user of the online book store to visit that web page.
