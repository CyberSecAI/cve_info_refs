# Unititialized memory access in HTTP/3 server-side implementation

Moderate

[kazuho](/kazuho)
published
GHSA-f9xw-j925-m4m4
Jan 31, 2022

## Package

h2o
(C)

## Affected versions

93af138..8c0eca3

## Patched versions

8c0eca3

## Description

### Impact

When receiving QUIC frames in certain order, HTTP/3 server-side implementation of h2o can be misguided to treat uninitialized memory as HTTP/3 frames that have been received. When h2o is used as a reverse proxy, an attacker can abuse this vulnerability to send internal state of h2o to backend servers controlled by the attacker or third party. Also, if there is an HTTP endpoint that reflects the traffic sent from the client, an attacker can use that reflector to obtain internal state of h2o.

This internal state includes traffic of other connections in unencrypted form and TLS session tickets.

### Patches

This vulnerability exists in h2o server with HTTP/3 support, between commit [93af138](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/commit/93af1383b248e9284ba5f63211b4fbb4c828d060) and [d1f0f65](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/commit/d1f0f65269917a2d20945f93461a29c11a2ae960). None of the released versions of h2o are affected by this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

There are no known workarounds. Users of unreleased versions of h2o using HTTP/3 are advised to upgrade immediately.

### Acknowledgement

This vulnerability was reported by Emil Lerner

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
