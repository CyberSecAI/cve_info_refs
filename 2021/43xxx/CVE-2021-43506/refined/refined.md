- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `password` parameter of the login form.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability in the `Login.php` file
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the admin panel.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious SQL payload into the password field during login.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the web application and knowledge of the vulnerable parameter (`password` in `Login.php`). They also need to be able to manipulate form data.
