# SQL injection in OpenProject budgets reassignment

High

[oliverguenther](/oliverguenther)
published
GHSA-f565-3whr-6m96
Dec 14, 2021

## Package

OpenProject

## Affected versions

>= 12.0.0, < 12.0.4

## Patched versions

12.0.4

## Description

### Impact

OpenProject versions >= 12.0.0 are vulnerable to a SQL injection in the budgets module. For authenticated users with the "Edit budgets" permission, the request to reassign work packages to another budget unsufficiently sanitizes user input in the `reassign_to_id` parameter.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been fixed in version 12.0.4. Versions prior to 12.0.0 are not affected. If you're upgrading from an older version, ensure you are upgrading to at least version 12.0.4.

### Workarounds

If you are unable to upgrade in a timely fashion, the following patch can be applied: <https://github.com/opf/openproject/pull/9983.patch>

### References

* [#9983](https://github.com/opf/openproject/pull/9983)
* <https://www.openproject.org/docs/release-notes/12-0-4/>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Release date: 2021-12-14

We released [OpenProject 12.0.4](https://community.openproject.com/versions/1502).

The release contains several bug fixes and we recommend updating to the newest version.

### CVE-2021-43830

OpenProject versions >= 12.0.0 are vulnerable to a SQL injection in the budgets module. For authenticated users with the "Edit budgets" permission, the request to reassign work packages to another budget unsufficiently sanitizes user input in the reassign\_to\_id parameter.

#### Patches

The vulnerability has been fixed in version 12.0.4. Versions prior to 12.0.0 are not affected. If you're upgrading from an older version, ensure you are upgrading to at least version 12.0.4.

#### Workaround

If you are unable to upgrade in a timely fashion, the following patch can be applied: <https://github.com/opf/openproject/pull/9983.patch>
