```
Root cause of vulnerability: When invoking protocol handlers for external protocols, a supplied parameter URL containing spaces was not properly escaped.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper input sanitization, specifically, lack of proper escaping of spaces in URLs passed to external protocol handlers. This allows for potential command injection if the external protocol handler doesn't handle spaces properly.
Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary command execution by a malicious website due to improper handling of URL parameters passed to external protocol handlers on Windows.
Attack vectors: A malicious website can craft a URL with spaces in its parameters that, when opened by the browser, triggers an external protocol handler on Windows. If the external protocol handler doesn't handle spaces correctly, it can lead to command injection.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to get the user to open a crafted URL via a website, email or other method.
