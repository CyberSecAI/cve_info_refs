The provided content contains information about CVE-2021-43812.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `@auth0/nextjs-auth0` library not properly filtering the `returnTo` parameter in the login URL. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary URLs into the `returnTo` parameter, leading to an open redirect vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Open redirect vulnerability: The application redirects users to a URL specified by the `returnTo` parameter without proper validation, potentially leading users to a malicious site.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious link that, when clicked by a user, will redirect them to a site controlled by the attacker after a successful authentication. This could be used for phishing attacks or other malicious purposes.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL that includes a `returnTo` parameter pointing to an attacker-controlled website. When a user logs in using this crafted URL, they are redirected to the attacker's site after successful authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the `returnTo` parameter and trick the user into clicking on that URL to initiate the authentication process.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of `@auth0/nextjs-auth0` `<=1.6.1`.
- The fix involves sanitizing the `returnTo` parameter to ensure it redirects to a safe location by comparing the origin with the configured base URL.
- The fix was implemented in commit `0bbd9f8a0c93af51f607f28633b5fb18c5e48ad6`.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" severity.
