Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43008:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper access control within Adminer, a web-based database management tool. It allows an attacker to perform arbitrary file reads by manipulating Adminer's connection to a remote MySQL database. The core issue lies in the `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` SQL command, which can be triggered remotely by a crafted MySQL server, causing Adminer to read files from the server on which it's running and send their content to the attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** Adminer fails to adequately control access when connecting to external MySQL servers, allowing malicious servers to trigger file read actions.
*   **Abuse of `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE`:** The `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` SQL command is not properly restricted. This command is intended to load data from a local file on the *client* to the server but can be abused to read arbitrary files on the server machine when the client is vulnerable (like older versions of Adminer).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** Attackers can read any file accessible to the user running the Adminer instance on the server.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as configuration files (e.g., database credentials stored in configuration files like `local.xml`), application code, private keys, and other confidential data.
*   **Database Compromise:** Once the attacker gains access to database credentials, they can take control of the database, potentially stealing private data or injecting malicious content.
*   **Full System Compromise:** In some cases, reading specific files might lead to more widespread system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote MySQL Server:** The attacker needs to control a malicious MySQL server that can issue `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` requests to the Adminer client.
*   **Web Access to Adminer:** The attacker must be able to access the Adminer login page on the vulnerable server.
*   **SQL Injection (Indirect):** Although not a direct SQL injection vulnerability in Adminer, the vulnerability is triggered via crafted SQL commands sent from the attacker's malicious MySQL server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the server running Adminer to access the login page.
*   **Malicious MySQL Server:** The attacker must control a MySQL server that can respond to connection attempts with specially crafted requests that exploit the `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` vulnerability.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL and Adminer's usage to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Adminer versions up to and including 4.6.2.
*   Version 4.6.3 and later versions have fixed this issue, primarily by disabling `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE`.
*   The issue was not necessarily fixed intentionally initially.

The content provides a good explanation of how the vulnerability can be exploited, including the specific SQL command and how an attacker would use it to read sensitive files. It also gives advice on mitigation.
