Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-43985:

**CVE-2021-43985: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel**

*   **Root Cause:** The myPRO application allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass authentication and gain access.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, allowing unauthorized access.
    *   **Alternate Path/Channel:** The vulnerability is specifically triggered through an alternative path or channel, suggesting that standard authentication checks are not being applied to all access points.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to completely compromise the products. While the CVSS vector string indicates High Confidentiality and Integrity impacts, Availability is not impacted.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely, meaning they do not need physical access to the system.
    *   **Network:** The attack occurs over the network.
    *   **Low Attack Complexity**: The attack is easy to execute.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs network access to the affected myPRO system.
    *   No specific user privileges or prior authentication is needed.
