The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-43000, found in the Eltima SDK and its derivatives used in various cloud services.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerabilities stem from insecure handling of user-supplied buffers within the `wspvuhub.sys` and `wspusbfilter.sys` drivers, specifically in the IOCTL handlers 0x22005B and 0x22001B. These handlers use `METHOD_NEITHER` for data transfer, which requires the driver to perform its own buffer validation, probing, and locking. However, the code lacks proper checks, leading to vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** Insecure arithmetic operations on user-controlled data when calculating the copy size for `memmove` can lead to integer overflows. This happens because the driver doesn't validate if the `copy_size` is smaller than the allocated `alloc_size`, causing a heap overflow.
- **Lack of Buffer Verification:** The IOCTL handler does not properly validate or probe the user-supplied buffer, resulting in the possibility of double fetches, and arbitrary pointer dereference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows a local, unprivileged user to escalate to kernel-level privileges.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The heap overflow can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution in kernel mode.
- **Bypassing Security Products:** The ability to execute code in kernel mode enables attackers to disable security products.
- **System Corruption:** Attackers can overwrite system components, potentially corrupting the operating system.
- **Broader Network Compromise:** Attackers can gain access to execute code on unpatched systems and then use this vulnerability to gain local elevation of privilege and then move laterally within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Exploitation:** An attacker with local access to a vulnerable machine can exploit the flaw.
- **Sandboxed Environments:** Due to lack of ACL enforcements on the device, exploitation is possible from sandboxes.
- **Browser-Based Attacks:** While less likely due to modern browser restrictions, it is potentially exploitable as a second-stage attack from browsers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the machine with the vulnerable driver.
- **Ability to Send IOCTLs:** The attacker needs the capability to send crafted IOCTL requests to the vulnerable device.

**Additional Details:**
- The article provides a detailed breakdown of the vulnerable code and includes a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) example showing how to trigger a Blue Screen of Death (BSoD) by sending a crafted IOCTL request.
- The vulnerability affects both the client and server sides of the affected applications because of code reuse.
- The article lists multiple affected products from different vendors (Amazon, NoMachine, Accops, etc.), all of which use the vulnerable Eltima SDK.
- The research mentions that while the team only tested a subset of cloud providers, itâ€™s likely that other cloud services using the same vulnerable libraries are affected.
