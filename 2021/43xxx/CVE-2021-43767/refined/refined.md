The provided content does not contain information about CVE-2021-43767. It describes a vulnerability, CVE-2021-23222, affecting PostgreSQL, where a man-in-the-middle attacker can inject false responses to the client's first few queries despite the use of SSL, potentially leading to exfiltration of sensitive data.

The vulnerability described in the provided text is:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-23222

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `libpq` client library processes unencrypted bytes from a man-in-the-middle attacker, even when SSL encryption is in use. This allows the attacker to inject false responses during the initial handshake.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The client is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks due to processing unencrypted data during the initial connection stages even if SSL is enabled.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   A man-in-the-middle attacker can inject false responses.
*   With additional preconditions, the attacker can exfiltrate sensitive data like client passwords if the server configuration is vulnerable to CVE-2021-23214 (trust authentication with clientcert or cert authentication).
*   The attacker must have access to the server to retrieve exfiltrated data.

**Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attack on the network connection between client and server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker needs to be positioned as a man-in-the-middle to intercept the network traffic between the PostgreSQL client and server.
* To exfiltrate sensitive information, the attacker needs a vulnerable server configuration (specifically, one that uses `trust` authentication with `clientcert` or `cert` authentication as described in CVE-2021-23214) and a way to retrieve the exfiltrated data (e.g. valid unprivileged login account).
