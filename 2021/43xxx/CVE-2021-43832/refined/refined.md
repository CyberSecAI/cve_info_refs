- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An incorrect wildcard match for the favorite icon in Spinnaker leads to improper permissions, allowing pipeline creation and execution by unauthenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control due to the incorrect wildcard match.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An arbitrary unauthenticated user with API access can create and execute pipelines. This can enable remote execution and access to deploy resources if RBAC is not properly configured on all accounts and applications within Spinnaker.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the Spinnaker API is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the Spinnaker API and does not require any prior authentication or privileges.
