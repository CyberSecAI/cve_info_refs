# Improper Access Control in spinnaker

Critical

[jasonmcintosh](/jasonmcintosh)
published
GHSA-9h7c-rfrp-gvgp
Jan 3, 2022

## Package

spinnaker
(Spinnaker)

## Affected versions

<1.25.8, <1.26.7, <1.27.0

## Patched versions

1.25.8, 1.26.7, 1.27.0

## Description

### Impact

Spinnaker has improper permissions allowing pipeline creation & execution due to an incorrect wildcard match for the favorite icon. This lets an arbitrary unauthenticated user with access to the API to create and execute a pipeline. If users haven't setup RBAC with-in spinnaker on all accounts and applications, this enables remote execution and access to deploy resources.

### Patches

1.25.8

1.26.7

1.27.0

### Workarounds

Enable RBAC on all accounts and applications. Restrict application creation. This mitigates the ability of a pipeline to affect any accounts.

Block application access unless permission are enabled. See:

<https://docs.armory.io/armory-enterprise/armory-admin/fiat-create-permissions/>

ALL application creation would need to be restricted via appropriate wildcards.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N
