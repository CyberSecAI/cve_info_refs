Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-43531

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the `contextMenus.onClicked` event in WebExtensions handled the `info.srcUrl` property. Instead of returning the original URL of the image, it returned the final URL after any redirects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Same-Origin Policy Violation:** This behavior could lead to a same-origin policy violation. Web extensions lacking the `WebRequest` permission for hosts involved in a redirect could access the post-redirect URL, effectively exposing data they shouldn't have access to.
- **Data Leakage:** By accessing the post-redirect URL, a malicious extension could potentially retrieve sensitive data such as authentication tokens or other private information present in the redirected URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Malicious web extensions could access and leak sensitive information contained within the redirected URL.
- **Potential Account Takeover:** If authentication tokens are exposed through the redirected URL, a malicious extension could potentially use them to take over a user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Extension:** An attacker could create a malicious Web Extension that exploits this vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to trigger the Web Extension's context menu on an image that redirects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create and Distribute Malicious Extension:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious web extension and distribute it to users, e.g. through the official add-on store or other channels.
- **Extension Must Be Installed:** The user needs to install the malicious Web Extension.
- **User Must Interact with Context Menu:** The user must right-click on an image that is subject to a redirect and use the extension's context menu.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability is related to CVE-2021-43532, which was a similar issue in the "Copy Image Link" context menu.
- The vulnerability was fixed by changing the `info.srcUrl` to return the pre-redirect URL instead of the post-redirect URL.
- The fix was implemented in Firefox 94.
- The issue existed in Firefox since the implementation of bug 1406253 which changed the behavior of `info.srcUrl`
- The fix also aligns Firefox with Chrome, which always returned the initial URL.
