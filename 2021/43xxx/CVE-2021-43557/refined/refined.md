Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The `uri-block` plugin in Apache APISIX uses the `$request_uri` variable without proper verification or normalization. `$request_uri` contains the full original request URI.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The lack of normalization of the `$request_uri` variable allows for path traversal bypass. Specifically, the use of multiple slashes (`//`) in the URI can bypass block lists that rely on a specific path format.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** By crafting URIs with unnormalized paths, attackers can bypass intended restrictions defined in the block list, potentially gaining access to restricted resources or functionality.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests containing URIs with unnormalized paths.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to an Apache APISIX instance.

**More details:**

The vulnerability is not limited to the `uri-block` plugin; other plugins using the `$request_uri` variable without proper verification are also affected. Additionally, custom plugins developed by users might also be vulnerable if they use the `$request_uri` without sanitization.
The fix involves upgrading to version 2.10.2 of Apache APISIX and also reviewing custom code for similar insecure usage of `$request_uri`.
