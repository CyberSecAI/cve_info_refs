https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L&version=3.1
Metric Value Comments
Attack Vector Network The vulnerable component is IKE which bound to the network stack, The attacker can exploit crafted IKE packet to trigger the vulnerability across a wide area network
Attack Complexity Low The attacker just needs construct specialized IKE packet
Privileges Required None The attacker can exploit the vulnerability as long as he is able to send packet to the IKE service.
User Interaction None No user interaction needed from any user
Scope Unchanged Only IKE itself would be affected.
Confidentiality None No information would be returned to attached after a successful exploited vulnerability
Integrity Low In most of scenario, the specifically crafted packet lead to reading beyond the end of a buffer, there is no change of anything. while in a specific scenario, it may lead double-free which will modify data in theory. this is limited in IKE component, no impact to whole system
Availability Low The impact is only limited to IKE component while VxWorks is still in service when attack happened

| [CVE-2025-23113](https://support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=cve&on=view&id=CVE-2025-23113) | An issue was discovered in REDCap 14.9.6. It has an action=myprojects&logout=1 CSRF issue in the alert-title while performing an upload of a CSV file containing a list of alert configuration. An attacker can send the victim a CSV file containing an HTML injection payload in the alert-title. Once the victim uploads the file, he automatically lands on a page to view the uploaded data. If the victim click on the alert-title value, it can trigger a logout request and terminates their session, or redirect to a phishing website. This vulnerability stems from the absence of CSRF protections on the logout functionality. | -- | Jan 10, 2025 |

It allows HTML Injection via the Survey field name, exposing users to a redirection to a phishing website. An attacker can exploit this to trick the user that receives the survey into clicking on the field name, which redirects them to a phishing website. Thus, this allows malicious actions to be executed without user consent. | -- | Jan 10, 2025 |

A Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the email-subject field exists while performing an upload of a CSV file containing a list of alert configurations. An attacker can send the victim a CSV file containing the XSS payload in the email-subject. Once the victim uploads the file, he automatically lands on a page to view the uploaded data. If the victim clicks on the email-subject value, it triggers the XSS payload. | -- | Jan 10, 2025 |

| [CVE-2025-23042](https://support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=cve&on=view&id=CVE-2025-23042) | Gradio is an open-source Python package that allows quick building of demos and web application for machine learning models, API, or any arbitrary Python function. Gradio\'s Access Control List (ACL) for file paths can be bypassed by altering the letter case of a blocked file or directory path. This vulnerability arises due to the lack of case normalization in the file path validation logic. On case-insensitive file systems, such as those used by Windows and macOS, this flaw enables attackers to circumvent security restrictions and access sensitive files that should be protected. This issue can lead to unauthorized data access, exposing sensitive information and undermining the integrity of Gradio\'s security model. Given Gradio\'s popularity for building web applications, particularly in machine learning and AI, this vulnerability may pose a substantial threat if exploited in production environments. This issue has been addressed in release version 5.6.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | -- | Jan 14, 2025 |

| [CVE-2025-23026](https://support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=cve&on=view&id=CVE-2025-23026) | jte (Java Template Engine) is a secure and lightweight template engine for Java and Kotlin. In affected versions Jte HTML templates with `script` tags or script attributes that include a Javascript template string (backticks) are subject to XSS. The `javaScriptBlock` and `javaScriptAttribute` methods in the `Escape` class do not escape backticks, which are used for Javascript template strings. Dollar signs in template strings should also be escaped as well to prevent undesired interpolation. HTML templates rendered by Jte\'s `OwaspHtmlTemplateOutput` in versions less than or equal to `3.1.15` with `script` tags or script attributes that contain Javascript template strings (backticks) are vulnerable.

This user can then insert \*\*script rendering macros\*\* that are executed for those users in the realtime session that have script or programming rights. The inserted scripts can be used to gain more access rights. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.10.2, 16.4.1 and 16.6.0-rc-1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may either disable the realtime WYSIWYG editing by disabling the ``xwiki-realtime`` CKEditor plugin from the WYSIWYG editor administration section or uninstall the Realtime WYSIWYG Editorextension (org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-realtime-wysiwyg-ui). | -- | Jan 14, 2025 |

However, guessing or brute-forcing resource UUIDs are generally hard to impossible and access to listing or adding comments isn\'t same as access to CloudStack resources, making this issue of very low severity and general low impact. CloudStack admins may also disallow listAnnotations and addAnnotation API access to non-admin roles in their environment as an interim measure. | -- | Jan 13, 2025 |
