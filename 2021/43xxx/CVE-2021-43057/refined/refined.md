Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43057:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2021-43057 and includes details about its impact, affected products, and remediation. Therefore, the content is relevant.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Linux Kernel related to the handling of subjective and objective credentials in the SELinux and Smack security modules. Specifically, some LSM (Linux Security Module) hooks were incorrectly accessing the subjective credentials of a task other than the currently executing task. This is unsafe and can lead to issues. Additionally, the `smack` LSM had similar issues with incorrect credential usage.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Incorrect access to subjective credentials of other tasks.
    *   Improper handling of objective credentials when accessing other tasks.
    *   Potential information disclosure, data modification, or denial-of-service due to flawed security checks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Disclosure of sensitive information.
    *   Addition or modification of data.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Attack Vectors:** Local access, according to the CVSS vector string in NetApp advisory which is `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Local access to the system.
    *   Low privileges are sufficient.
    *   No user interaction is required.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   The NetApp advisory clarifies that the vulnerability affects Linux Kernel versions prior to 5.14.8.
*   The NetApp advisory lists specific affected products, including:
    *   NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault)
    *   NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H300S/H500S/H700S/H300E/H500E/H700E/H410S
    *   NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H410C
*   The advisory also lists numerous NetApp products that are *not* affected.
*   The NetApp advisory states that there are no workarounds at this time.

The Linux kernel patch addresses the issue by restoring the use of the task's objective credentials in those cases where the task is not the currently executing task. This resolves the security issues reported by Jann Horn.
