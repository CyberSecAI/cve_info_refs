Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43855:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of file uploads, specifically SVG files. The application relied solely on the MIME type provided in the request header to determine if a file was an SVG and should be sanitized. This could be bypassed by using a custom request with a fake MIME type while still uploading a malicious SVG file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate MIME type validation:** The application trusted the client-provided MIME type, which is easily spoofed, instead of verifying the actual file content.
- **Missing file extension verification:**  The code did not verify the file extension of the uploaded file in addition to the MIME type.
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows for injecting malicious JavaScript code into SVG files, which are then stored on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Stored XSS:** Successful exploitation enables the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of other users who view the malicious SVG file directly. This can lead to a range of malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Custom HTTP Request:** An attacker needs to craft a custom HTTP request with a fake MIME type while uploading the malicious SVG.
- **File Upload:** The attacker leverages the file upload functionality of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Malicious User:** The attacker needs to be a user capable of uploading files.
- **Custom HTTP request creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a custom request with a modified header (specifically the Content-Type/MIME type).

**Additional Details from the provided context:**
- The vulnerability affects Wiki.js versions prior to 2.5.264.
- The patch ([57b56d3](https://github.com/requarks/wiki/commit/57b56d3a5b9c00358814e76f3ee5b4bb353ad62f)) introduces a check on the file extension in addition to the MIME type during the SVG sanitization process.
-  The vulnerability is considered to be of "Moderate" severity.
- The malicious script is not executed when the SVG is loaded via an <img> tag, but is executed when it is directly viewed.
- A workaround is to disable file uploads for untrusted users.
