## CVE-2021-43566.html:

```

===========================================================
== Subject:     Symlink race error can allow directory creation
==              outside of the exported share.
==
== CVE ID#:     CVE-2021-43566
==
==
== Versions:    All versions of the Samba file server prior to
==              4.13.16
==
== Summary:     A malicious client can use a symlink race to
==              create a directory in a part of the server file
==              system not exported under the share definition.
==              The user must have permissions to create the
==              directory in the target directory.
===========================================================

===========
Description
===========

All versions of Samba prior to 4.13.16 are vulnerable to a malicious
client using an SMB1 or NFS symlink race to allow a directory to be
created in an area of the server file system not exported under the
share definition. Note that SMB1 has to be enabled, or the share
also available via NFS in order for this attack to succeed.

Clients that have write access to the exported part of the file system
under a share via SMB1 unix extensions or NFS can create symlinks that
can race the server by renaming an existing path and then replacing it
with a symlink. If the client wins the race it can cause the server to
create a directory under the new symlink target after the exported
share path check has been done. This new symlink target can point to
anywhere on the server file system. The authenticated user must have
permissions to create a directory under the target directory of the
symlink.

This is a difficult race to win, but theoretically possible. Note that
the proof of concept code supplied wins the race only when the server
is slowed down and put under heavy load. Exploitation of this bug has
not been seen in the wild.

==================
Patch Availability
==================

Patches addressing this issue has been posted to:

    https://www.samba.org/samba/security/

Samba 4.13.16 has been issued as a security releases to correct the
defect. Samba administrators are advised to upgrade to this release as
soon as possible.

==================
CVSSv3.1 calculation
==================

CVSS:2.2/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C/CR:L/IR:L/AR:L/MAV:N/MAC:H/MPR:L/MUI:N/MS:U/MC:L/MI:N/MA:N

base score of 2.6.

=================================
Workaround and mitigating factors
=================================

Do not enable SMB1 (please note SMB1 is disabled by default in Samba
from version 4.11.0 and onwards). This prevents the creation of
symbolic links via SMB1. If SMB1 must be enabled for backwards
compatibility then add the parameter:

unix extensions = no

to the [global] section of your smb.conf and restart smbd. This
prevents SMB1 clients from creating symlinks on the exported file
system.

However, if the same region of the file system is also exported using
NFS, NFS clients can create symlinks that potentially can also hit the
race condition. For non-patched versions of Samba we recommend only
exporting areas of the file system by either SMB2 or NFS, not both.

Reported by Michael Hanselmann of Google.
Jeremy Allison of Google and the Samba Team provided the fix.

| [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=14842#c11)  Jeremy Allison    2021-10-21 15:57:18 UTC  ``` Comment from Jim @ SuSE.  We're going to do like RH and mark earlier versions as unsafe with SMB1 (or in our oldest case, unix extensions/NFS), and update our latest two releases (SLES12SP5 and SLES15SP3) to 4.15. ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=14842#c12)  Jeremy Allison    2021-10-21 15:58:07 UTC  ``` OK, as agreed upon, I'm now opening this bug up to Samba vendors. ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=14842#c13)  Stefan Metzmacher    2021-10-25 14:56:02 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jeremy Allison from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=14842#c12))  Please make sure that [https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14846](show_bug.cgi?id=14846 "RESOLVED FIXED - new Kerberos options of client tools behave quite weird") (and also possible other regressions) gets fixed before telling the world to upgrade to 4.15. ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=14842#c14)  Jeremy Allison    2021-10-27 16:09:53 UTC  ``` Release date for this has been set as January 10th 2022. ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=14842#c15)  Matt McDonald    2021-10-27 16:16:31 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jeremy Allison from [comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=14842#c14))  Is January 10th, 2022 the same date the vulnerability will be publicly announced? ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=14842#c16)  Jeremy Allison    2021-10-27 16:19:42 UTC  ``` Yes, the plan is to announce on January 10th 2022. Let me know if this works for everyone please. ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=14842#c17)  Arvid Requate    2022-01-05 17:32:09 UTC  ``` Any news for samba-vendor? ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=14842#c18)  Jeremy Allison    2022-01-05 18:09:27 UTC  ``` January 10th will be the announcement date. What more for samba-vendor do you need ? ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=14842#c19)  Arvid Requate    2022-01-05 18:30:07 UTC  ``` Usually there are patches available about two weeks ahead of the public release. But maybe I'm misunderstanding the term "announcement". ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=14842#c20)  Jeremy Allison    2022-01-05 18:34:13 UTC  ``` The "patch" for this is 4.15.0 and above. It was a 2-3 year rewrite to fix the VFS layer to make everything handle based and remove any possibility of symlink escape.  There are only mitigations possible for releases below 4.15. ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=14842#c21)  Jule Anger    2022-01-10 15:03:02 UTC  ``` Removing vendor CC (so that any public comments don't need to be broadcast so widely) and opening these bugs to the public.   If you wish to continue to be informed about any changes here please CC individually. ``` |  |

| [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c1)  Jeremy Allison    2019-05-30 01:19:56 UTC  ``` Ah, I see the problem. The non_widelink_open() code that protects us from this in the open/creat code path isn't being used in the mkdir case.  Rename will suffer from the same problem for the destination path specifier. I'll try and fix both cases for this bug.  Ultimately we need to modify the VFS to use the syscallAT() varients of all the system calls, but that's a VFS rewrite we will have to schedule for another day. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c2)  Andrew Bartlett    2019-05-30 02:45:08 UTC  ``` Michael,  Can you please confirm you are happy to be identified as the reporter of this issue (in the same was as your previous reports)?  Thanks! ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c3)  Jeremy Allison    2019-05-30 03:19:37 UTC  ``` OK, I think I can see a way to fix this (on Linux at least) without breaking the ABI.  It's really ugly though, but will at least fix the problems with the syscalls that take 2 pathnames (rename and link are the two I can think of). ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c4)  Jeremy Allison    2019-05-30 17:09:59 UTC  ``` I'm planning on creating a patchset that will fix uses of  mkdir rename symlink mknod  which can be done in the same way as we handled the previous 'open' case (chdir).  rename link  are harder to fix, as the method used in the open case won't fully work here as they take 2 pathnames, both of which can by symlink raced.  To fix them, I'm planning to fix the 'src' component by doing the chdir method we use for open, and then inside vfs_default.c add code in the default rename/link syscall layer to open a temporary file handle to the parent directory of the target (using open(name, O_DIRECTORY|O_RDONLY, 0) - which is guaranteed not to conflict with locks (for the POSIX lock case) or leases, and then use the syscall variants of renameat(AT_CWD, src, fd, dst), linkat(AT_CWD, src, fd, dst) to implement these safely. This way we keep the VFS ABI and can easily back-port these changes.  Going forward we *really* need to remove the SMB1 server code, which will prevent any client instigated symlink races (only SMB1 extensions creates server-side symlinks) and modify the VFS to use the XXXat() syscal versions.  Sound like a plan ? ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c5)  hansmi    2019-05-30 21:42:03 UTC  ``` > Can you please confirm you are happy to be identified as the reporter of this issue (in the same was as your previous reports)?  Yes, I am happy with that.  Jeremy, I agree that the *at syscalls appear to be the most appropriate way where available. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c6)  Jeremy Allison    2019-05-31 22:38:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 15212](attachment.cgi?id=15212 "git am for master - prototype fix for mkdir") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=15212&action=edit "git am for master - prototype fix for mkdir") git am for master - prototype fix for mkdir  OK Michael, can you try to reproduce with this patch added.  I was able to reproduce your race without it, but once I added this patch I can't reproduce the issue anymore.  It adds wrapper functions:  safe_pathname_start() safe_pthname_end()  which I should be able to use to fix mkdir, symlink, mknod.  As I said, I need to do more work for symlink and link, but I think this shows how it can be done. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c7)  Jeremy Allison    2019-05-31 22:58:06 UTC  ``` Oh thank goodness, we still pass TESTS=raw.mkdir and TESTS=samba3.blackbox.shadow_copy2 with this patchset :-).  At SambaXP I'll see about making sure it passes on a private gitlab or catalyst CI run. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c8)  Jeremy Allison    2019-05-31 23:27:08 UTC  ``` Ah, hang on a minute. I am getting some crashes with this patch. Investigating.. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c9)  Jeremy Allison    2019-06-01 05:04:51 UTC  ``` Ah, OK - I think the crashes are the correct thing here.  What is happening is the python thread itself has a race where the "dest" directory sometimes doesn't exist:      if os.path.islink(dest):       os.unlink(dest)     elif os.path.isdir(dest):       shutil.rmtree(dest)  <---- Here "dest" doesn't exist for a time      os.mkdir(dest)     ev.set()     os.rename(dest, fordel)  <---- Here "dest" doesn't exist for a time      os.symlink("/tmp", dest)  Wht can happen is that we chdir() into "dest" (storing conn->cwd_fname = "/srv/data/dest") which exists, start doing the operation and then after the mkdir call succeeds call become_root()/unbecome_root() as part of the created directory post processing.  The unbecome_root() code then tries to chdir("/srv/data/dest") on popping the connection context stack (after all, we just created /srv/data/dest/shouldnotexist.timestamp, right !) and at this point "src/data/dest" doesn't exist (it's been deleted or moved etc.).  pop_conn_ctx() treats this as a panic error - see below:         /*          * Check if the current context did a chdir_current_service()          * and restore the cwd_fname of the previous context          * if needed.          */         if (current_user.done_chdir && ctx_p->need_chdir) {                 int ret;                  ret = vfs_ChDir(ctx_p->conn, ctx_p->conn->cwd_fname);                 if (ret != 0) {                         DBG_ERR("vfs_ChDir() failed!\n");                         smb_panic("vfs_ChDir() failed!\n");                 }         }  which IMHO is a reasonable decision. If the chdir() back to where we were we fails we don't know where we are in the filesystem and can't continue to process calls.  Looks like a self-inflicted wound at this point and it's reasonable to panic.  So I think my fix is good for the mkdir case (even though it causes an smbd crash), smbd is simply not designed for this kind of simultaneous manipulation of the tree by the same user. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c10)  Jeremy Allison    2019-06-01 05:12:53 UTC  ``` Yep, confirmed my suspicions by adding extra debug in the vfs_ChDir code:  [2019/05/31 22:10:21.639048,  0] ../../source3/smbd/vfs.c:811(vfs_ChDir)   vfs_ChDir: vfs_ChDir to /srv/data/dest No such file or directory [2019/05/31 22:10:21.639898,  0] ../../source3/smbd/uid.c:586(pop_conn_ctx)   pop_conn_ctx: vfs_ChDir() failed!

It depends on become_root()/unbecome_root() pairs only wrapping code that saves/restores any directory changes before returning.  Which luckily I think all of them do. Still looking at the usages. ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c14)  hansmi    2019-06-02 19:42:01 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 15213](attachment.cgi?id=15213 "Race reproduction script from June 2, 2019") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=15213&action=edit "Race reproduction script from June 2, 2019") Race reproduction script from June 2, 2019  > OK Michael, can you try to reproduce with this patch added.

Can't currently see how that can be happening once we've chdir()'ed into the target directory, checked it's under the share export and then do a "mkdir("./shouldnotexist.<timestamp>") only from within the chdir()'ed directory.  We are no longer doing mkdir() calls with anything but a single element path from inside the current directory.  Being inside the current $cwd should prevent a rename and symlink of the path above from having any effect.  Can you think of any way this can occur ? ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c16)  Jeremy Allison    2019-06-03 17:07:31 UTC  ``` I can add some test code into smbd that checks inside the mkdir syscall wrapper for the string "shouldnotexist", and if it finds it, checks for any "/" component in the given filename and calls abort() if found.  That would confirm we're never doing a multi-path mkdir call.  If we still get escapes after that, isn't it a kernel bug ? ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c17)  hansmi    2019-06-03 21:51:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 15214](attachment.cgi?id=15214 "Minor patch to address use-after free in May 31, 2019 patch from Jeremy") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=15214&action=edit "Minor patch to address use-after free in May 31, 2019 patch from Jeremy") Minor patch to address use-after free in May 31, 2019 patch from Jeremy ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c18)  hansmi    2019-06-03 22:16:41 UTC  ``` > I can add some test code into smbd that checks inside the mkdir syscall wrapper for the string "shouldnotexist", and if it finds it, checks for any "/" component in the given filename and calls abort() if found.  I did just that and can confirm that mkdir is never called with "/" in its path argument. I'm still investigating. Unfortunately running smbd through strace appears to modify timing such that the race no longer occurs. ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c19)  hansmi    2019-06-03 22:22:24 UTC  ``` And as I was writing my previous comment the reproduction was successful:  22:16:36.567227 chdir("/srv/data/dest") = 0 <0.000038> 22:16:36.567373 stat(".", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|S_ISVTX|0777, st_size=800, ...}) = 0 <0.000030> 22:16:36.567502 stat("/tmp", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|S_ISVTX|0777, st_size=800, ...}) = 0 <0.000038> 22:16:36.567806 mkdir("shouldnotexist.1559600196.1234279", 0755) = 0 <0.000119>  So what happens is that chdir(2) itself is redirected via the symlink. I've seen other programs essentially walking the whole path from "/" via fchdir(2), though that seems quite excessive.  Could we rely on getcwd(3) and friends to check whether chdir(2) ended up in the correct place?

Figured it out trying to get to sleep on the plane :-), so had to buy wifi to report this.  We should not be calling the chdir() just before the mkdir(), the reason we are is a bug in unbecome_root() which is triggering a chdir() which should be skipped.  I actually have a fix for this on my laptop, but will have to wait until I'm on the ground with full connectivity again to upload.

That created the new race you found, as the inheritance calculations call a code path that uses become_root()/unbecome_root().  The initial check for being under the share path using realpath inside safe_pathname_start() is actually good, and does catch a symlink racer, but the problem is in the unbecome-root() code it can call chdir(conn->old_cwd) *again*, after the correct check. That then opens up the symlink redirect race again that we just protected ourselves against.  My new patch eliminates that chdir() in the unbecome root code, leaving the initial check as a  direct check.  I think this is the correct fix, as become_root()/unbecome_root() pairs should only be changing credentials, not directories. We only didn't notice it was doing so before as a side effect of code reuse as it was doing a (considered harmless) chdir($cwd).  As I say, I have an updated fix I'll upload once I'm on the ground. Should fix the smbd crashes we've been seeing too. ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c22)  Jeremy Allison    2019-06-04 00:51:13 UTC  ``` (In reply to hansmi from [comment #19](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c19))  FYI O_NOFOLLOW is a horrible misnomer as it never does what you need it to :-).

After reading a bit more code I suspect all or most cases where more than a mere filename is passed to system calls is susceptible, e.g.:  * SMB_VFS_CHMOD used by file_set_dosmode calls chmod(smb_fname->base_name, mode). * Most xattr functions, also used by file_set_dosmode, are similar in that they don't operate on file descriptors.

We may not be able to fully harden the XATTR calls. ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c34)  Jeremy Allison    2019-06-06 13:59:14 UTC  ``` OK, I think I have a plan to proceed. I'm planning to remove all use of VFS_CHMOD() calls from Samba, due to it being unsafe to use on Linux (fchmod requires a real file descriptor, which would break the kernel oplocks) by restructuring some code to insist on file handles instead of pathnames.  Also remove the set_acl_XXXX() calls and use fset_acl_XXX() calls instead as we can insist that opening a handle for WRITE_DAC|READ_CONTROL|WRITE_OWNER open a real fd underneath (these access masks already break oplocks, so it's safe for kernel oplocks).  Secondly I think we can change all the get/set/listxattr calls with their lget/lset/llist alternatives *below* the VFS layer (at the syscall layer). The reason for this is that we already don't work on Windows calls made against symlink last-component targets - as we never call VFS_CHOWN, we only *ever* call VFS_LCHOWN which doesn't follow symlinks on last component.  Given that, I think I can start to bleed fixes into the master tree as 'normal' bugfixes to do preparatory work for the security fix.  Eventually, get to the point where I can add in the safe_pathname_start()/safe_pathname_end() calls to wrap the multiple-component paths and really fix this.  This is going to take a while I think, so I'll start to send in the first preparatory patches in the next few weeks, and keep building towards a complete fix. ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c35)  Jeremy Allison    2019-06-13 16:56:56 UTC  ``` I think I'm going to log bugs for the prerequisite patches, and make this bug a dependency on them.

Essentially the design we came up with was SMB_VFS_CREATE_FILE() saving us by returning an fsp for the containing directory for any pathname that we then pass to all existing pathname-based calls such as ret = LSTATAT(fsp, smb_fname);  However, SMB_VFS_CREATE_FILE() itself can't take an fsp for the containing directory, as we then have a chicken and egg problem - it still has to operate on paths relative to the current $cwd.  So the pathname calls we use in the codepaths called from inside SMB_VFS_CREATE_FILE() can't take an fsp, as we don't have one yet. This isn't a problem with the code inside there to open the file descriptor, as it's written to be symlink safe.  So we have to SMB_VFS_CHDIR() (which will be a remaining pathname based call with no fsp) to the containing directory, and then use the fd_open wrapper call (again, not taking an fsp as it's symlink safe) in order to get a fd on the "." directory, then fake up an fsp pointer to pass into the pathname calls.  The POSIX syscalls fix this by having a special AT_CWD parameter to be used meaning current directory when an application has no file descriptor to be relative to.  Should we create the fake-fsp for "." inside SMB_VFS_CREATE_FILE(), or pass in a special pointer value (possibly not NULL so we can better detect programming errors) that is the equivalent of FSP_AT_CWD ?  This adding complexity which I was hoping to avoid, but I don't see any other way around the chicken-and-egg issue with SMB_VFS_CREATE_FILE(), can you all ?

That means walking the pathname component by component every time, which I was hoping to avoid. If we have to, we have to though.  It would mean doing the inital stat-cache lookup given the client passed-in pathname, to try and avoid any directory searches, then starting from the fake fsp share root open directories step by step down the path, no enumerating them unless an open on the next path component fails, returning the last parent directory handle fsp as well as the last component.  Means a rewrite of unix_convert though, but I'm guessing that's going to be on the cards whatever we chose :-(.  We could cache the open directory handles on the connection struct for the share. We'd have to have some heuristic for closing them though, otherwise we're going to drown in opened fsp handles. As most filesystem access tends to be localized in a single directory (except for special cases like tree traveral for backup or ACL modificaion) that shouldn't be so bad.  That would mean SMB_VFS_CREATE_FILE() takes a parent_fsp pointer, always. We then pass in only the last component name to SMB_VFS_CREATE_FILE(), relative to parent_fsp. To keep the logic around fsp->fsp_name untouched we'd then need to store the combination of:  parent_fsp->fsp_name + last_component name as the fsp_name of the being created fsp.

Thinking a little more, to create a fake fsp for the share root we still need to be able to do:  int fd = SMB_VFS_OPENAT(conn, SMB_AT_CWD, smb_fname, mode);  inside the 'create_fake_fsp' code.  - the SMB_AT_CWD removes the chicken and egg problem when creating the fake_share_root_fsp->fh->fd value.

I'm also adding Jeff Layton to the CC list, who's the Linux CephFS maintainer. Regarding the lack of ceph_fdopendir(). We may be able to instead use the "low-level" cephFS API to pin parent directories before child creation. Both ceph_ll_create() and ceph_ll_mkdir() accept a parent inode pointer alongside the child name. The ceph_ll_walk() AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW flag looks like it also might be helpful, but there's next to no documentation for these low-level functions, so I'll need some time to take a closer look. ```  [Comment 62](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c62)  Jeremy Allison    2019-07-08 17:43:54 UTC  ``` > Regarding the lack of ceph_fdopendir().

This is too large to do in private, so I'm doing this in public under the guise of "modernising the VFS to use handle-based operations" (without saying explicitly *why* I'm doing so).  Table stakes here is to move all our VFS operations to the XXXXAT() style of interface, so that's what I'm trying to do as rapidly as possible.  What I need right now is help and review on these code changes (which are explicitly *not* changing our current pathname logic, just migrating the interfaces from things like : SMB_VFS_RENAME -> SMB_VFS_RENAMEAT whilst using the magic SMB_VFS_AT_FDCWD value as the srcfsp or dstfsp pointer value to mean the same as the syscall AT_FDCWD value which means "do this in the current directory".  Once all our VFS operations are updated to use this approach, then we have the ability to actually go on and fix the problem.  But make no mistakes, fixing it is going to be really hard as there is so much existing code in existing VFS modules like shadow_copy2, fruit, virusscanner, recycle, streams_depot etc. that expects incoming pathnames to be $CWD + smb_fname_share_relative_path.  Changing this to work and keep all our tests working to cope with :  cwd_fsp + smb_fname_last_component_path  is going to be really difficult. As smb_fname already has a value for:          char *original_lcomp;  I'm thinking of maybe keeping the existing smb_fname_share_relative_path in:          char *base_name;         char *stream_name;  and using original_lcomp as the last component relative pointer to the component in "base_name" after any last '/' character in order to avoid all the horrendous extra string manipulations we'll need.  But without SMB_VFS_XXXXXAT() we're not even in the place where we can start on that yet.  So right now the help I really want is doing the boilerplate VFS code updates (or even just rapid code review, I know what needs doing and can crank out this code myself if needed) to get us to SMB_VFS_XXXXXAT(). -------------------------------------------------------------- ```  [Comment 69](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c69)  Jeremy Allison    2019-09-04 00:07:03 UTC  ``` Just an update - migration of the VFS in master to XXXat() calls is ongoing.

SMB_VFS_CHOWN (pathname based) removal is the next one awaiting review.  I have one design decision I'd like to make though.  Currently we have a parameter "widelinks = [yes|no]" which we use to allow symlinks to escape from a share definition or not.  Yes I know it's insane, but there are existing customers out there using this, and I'd like to break as little as possible going forward.  What I'd like to do is remove the "widelinks =" parameter and replace it with a non-stackable VFS module vfs_widelinks.  This would then remove the AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW flags on any passed in SMB_VFS_XXXAT() calls which will implicitly make symlinks become invisible to the upper layer code.  I'd need to also change the SMB_VFS_REALPATH call to always return the absolute path created by appending the share definition path with the path passed in to realpath (again making it appear that symlinks don't exist and are always followed).  If I can confine this to one VFS module, then I can change the rest of the server to never follow  symlinks outside the share without having to add lots of 'unless widelinks = yes' logic all over the place (look at the existing code inside the fd_open() code inside source3/smbd/open.c for an example of the what effect this has).  Essentially I can then ignore the little-used widelinks option whilst still allowing people who depend on this to add a VFS module that closely (probably not 100% identically) reproduces the old behavior.  This will simplify the make all pathnames safe logic immensely.  I'd need to (soon, before next release) mark the 'widelinks' parameter as deprecated and soon for removal if everyone agrees with this.

Because I'm not suggesting that the widelinks vfs module be loaded by default, that would be a very bad idea. The widelinks module I'm proposing will touch the core functionality inside fstatat, realpath and readdirplus which I really don't want in the 'normal' VFS code paths.  So when I move the widelinks behavior into the module and out of the core smbd code (which is the only sane way to fix this thing) then having the parameter as well is an extra switch controling exactly what loading the module already does.  Allowing wide links is a very strange behavior, I wish we'd never allowed it.  The number of sites that use/need wide links IMHO is small enough that on upgrade asking them to add a vfs objects entry to shares that require it instead seems to be a small mandatory change to insist on.  If we leave the parameter alone, then the sites that used it won't understand why the functionality stops working when the parameter is set because they didn't notice they also need to add 'vfs objects = widelinks'.

There are a lot of them. I think this is a bad idea and adds extra complexity, not to mention the extra code / time added for these tests and if statements on every VFS call.  It's extra complexity we simply don't need if we make this an optional module. Complexity is the enemy of security.  That way the default is complete symlink safety.  1). All smbd logic is written such that smbd refuses to allow access outside the share. I can't stress this enough being the correct design in terms of long-term maintainability. Compromise here is not a good idea.  2). For people who want insecurity, all of the logic that allows insecurity is concentrated in one optionally loaded module which causes the upper layer smbd to be blind to the existence of underlying symlinks, vfs_widelinks.  This is (IMHO) much clearer and simpler to code and to maintain in the long run. It isolates the logic on one place, not smearing it out all over the core smbd code.  Backwards parameter compatibility for insane parameters like this will kill us for maintainability and code simplicity in the long run.  We are already changing a lot for this fix, insisting on a new module being added only for people who want insecurity is not IMHO unreasonable.  Adding this module as part of the default stack I also disagree with, again due to the extra code being added into every VFS call.  The ability to compromise security like this isn't something that should be built into the default code path, it really needs to be an optional loaded module.  I really don't want to code this up the way you both have suggested, I think it's a bad idea for maintainability.  It isn't worth it for the number of people affected by this change.  This decision doesn't have to be made now, as the VFS code changes are still going in. But once they are done and the shape of the new VFS is done, at that point we have to make the changes to fix the symlink escapes.  I disagree with keeping the widelinks parameter and logic inside smbd so much I'm unwilling to do further work on this bug if I'm required to maintain it. It's simply costing me too much stress in coming up with a working design. Removing widelinks from the core code paths allowed me to see a way forward to a complete and clean fix in core smbd. It really does have to be in a vfs module simply to isolate the problem.

Aha ! Looking carefully the above is not correct. In MS-DFS it depends on unix_convert() returning ENOENT -> NT_STATUS_OBJECT_PATH_NOT_FOUND to trigger the MS-DFS component search. That means vfs_widelinks *would* still work with MS-DFS so long as we have the extra VFS call SMB_VFS_MSDFS_READLINKAT() that has an  implementation inside vfs_widelinks that does the LSTAT()/READLINK() calls internally to check for MS-DFS objects stored in links.  The initial pathname conversion on a MS-DFS symlink foo where (foo -> msdfs:\\dfs\redirect\path) does an unconditional STAT() call, gets ENOENT which then triggers the DFS pathname walk using SMB_VFS_MSDFS_READLINKAT() to check for MS-DFS components.  The vfs_widelinks module design is looking better and better :-). Seems like we can still have our cake and eat it :-). ```  [Comment 84](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c84)  Andrew Bartlett    2019-10-13 22:40:05 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jeremy Allison from [comment #82](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c82)) I think fundamentally changing a parameter into a warning message is the same as removing it, so I don't think our historical practice permits that.   The AD DC sets different default VFS objects based on a parameter, why can't we do that?  But better still would be having this be an implicit top-level module (or such) that becomes a no-op if the option is unset. ```  [Comment 85](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c85)  Jeremy Allison    2019-10-13 23:02:33 UTC  ``` (In reply to Andrew Bartlett from [comment #84](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c84))  > The AD DC sets different default VFS objects based on a parameter, why can't we > do that?  I will take a look, that might be possible.  > But better still would be having this be an implicit top-level module (or such) > that becomes a no-op if the option is unset.  No, sorry I fundamentally disagree with that. Having "break all security" as an implicit top-level module is *NOT* a good idea going forward. It makes far more sense to have it as a completely optional loaded module for the small number of users who depend on it.  I don't understand why I can't just remove this parameter - deprecating it first as I suggested. This is going to be a massive security release - the biggest one we've ever had to do. It's a fileserver *rewrite*. Please think about the implications of that.  As I said, I'm coming to the conclusion that I need to do this, and just break backwards compatibility.  This is difficult enough to do as it is, please don't make it worse by adding additional hoops to jump through to keep old insane options working without change. I'm getting to the point of just walking away from this I'm afraid. ```  [Comment 86](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c86)  Jeremy Allison    2019-10-13 23:03:28 UTC  ``` Separate email from Volker:  Haven't read all of the discussion in every detail, but you have my full support for removing the wide links parameter and putting that into a module. Even without deprecating it first, this is just a big security release that everybody will be aware of.

I don't think this will work if the user already has vfs objects set.  I'm also ok with making this an optional module that has to be explicitly enabled. And then it indeed makes no sense to keep the "wide links" option as it won't work as advertized unless the module is in the stack.  So +1 on deprecating and the module. ```  [Comment 88](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c88)  Andrew Bartlett    2019-10-21 06:08:21 UTC  ``` I attended Kawaiicon this year and watched as a "safe" limited shell was escaped via a symlink from the restricted directory to the root.  Not directly Samba, but the same idea.  It was enough to make me rethink my position here.    I think that the use case for 'wide links' can be reimplemented with bind mounts if really needed, so we should deprecate 'wide links' and strongly discourage even the use of the replacement module. ```  [Comment 89](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c89)  Björn Jacke    2019-10-21 11:27:57 UTC  ``` On 21.10.19 08:08, samba-bugs@samba.org wrote: > I think that the use case for 'wide links' can be reimplemented with bind > mounts  have in mind that bind mounts are a Linux feature and there are definetely other Unix-like flavours which do not have something like that.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=14000#c0)  Jeremy Allison    2019-06-17 16:20:05 UTC  ``` This got introduced as a part of code reuse, which is a good thing :-). However it introduced an additional vfs_ChDir($cwd_fname) in unbecome_root() due to consolidating the restore code in pop_sec_ctx().  This is unexpected behavior (although harmless as it's doing a chdir to where the calling code thinks it already is).  become_root()/unbecome_root() should only change security contexts, not filesystem directory position - it's certainly not expected by callers of the API (and indeed no callers expect or depend on this).  Discussed with Metze at SambaXP. Patch to follow. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=14000#c1)  Jeremy Allison    2019-06-17 19:58:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 15253](attachment.cgi?id=15253 "git-am fix for master.")

I just noticed that we have          current_user.need_chdir = false;         current_user.done_chdir = false;  in smbd_change_to_root_user().  I think we should add that also at the end of smbd_become_root(), which would have the same effect as your patch.  In addition I'd like to see asserts that we never call change_to_{user,user_by_fsp,guest,root_user}() from within a become_{user,root}() section.  And a single become_root() would generate an error if vfs_ChDir() or smb_vfs_call_chdir() is called before the matching unbecome_root().

Having assertions for the invalid API usage feels be much better (at least for master).  I haven't tested the patches, so maybe there are off by one errors...

| [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c1)  Jeremy Allison    2019-05-30 01:19:56 UTC  ``` Ah, I see the problem. The non_widelink_open() code that protects us from this in the open/creat code path isn't being used in the mkdir case.  Rename will suffer from the same problem for the destination path specifier. I'll try and fix both cases for this bug.  Ultimately we need to modify the VFS to use the syscallAT() varients of all the system calls, but that's a VFS rewrite we will have to schedule for another day. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c2)  Andrew Bartlett    2019-05-30 02:45:08 UTC  ``` Michael,  Can you please confirm you are happy to be identified as the reporter of this issue (in the same was as your previous reports)?  Thanks! ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c3)  Jeremy Allison    2019-05-30 03:19:37 UTC  ``` OK, I think I can see a way to fix this (on Linux at least) without breaking the ABI.  It's really ugly though, but will at least fix the problems with the syscalls that take 2 pathnames (rename and link are the two I can think of). ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c4)  Jeremy Allison    2019-05-30 17:09:59 UTC  ``` I'm planning on creating a patchset that will fix uses of  mkdir rename symlink mknod  which can be done in the same way as we handled the previous 'open' case (chdir).  rename link  are harder to fix, as the method used in the open case won't fully work here as they take 2 pathnames, both of which can by symlink raced.  To fix them, I'm planning to fix the 'src' component by doing the chdir method we use for open, and then inside vfs_default.c add code in the default rename/link syscall layer to open a temporary file handle to the parent directory of the target (using open(name, O_DIRECTORY|O_RDONLY, 0) - which is guaranteed not to conflict with locks (for the POSIX lock case) or leases, and then use the syscall variants of renameat(AT_CWD, src, fd, dst), linkat(AT_CWD, src, fd, dst) to implement these safely. This way we keep the VFS ABI and can easily back-port these changes.  Going forward we *really* need to remove the SMB1 server code, which will prevent any client instigated symlink races (only SMB1 extensions creates server-side symlinks) and modify the VFS to use the XXXat() syscal versions.  Sound like a plan ? ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c5)  hansmi    2019-05-30 21:42:03 UTC  ``` > Can you please confirm you are happy to be identified as the reporter of this issue (in the same was as your previous reports)?  Yes, I am happy with that.  Jeremy, I agree that the *at syscalls appear to be the most appropriate way where available. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c6)  Jeremy Allison    2019-05-31 22:38:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 15212](attachment.cgi?id=15212 "git am for master - prototype fix for mkdir") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=15212&action=edit "git am for master - prototype fix for mkdir") git am for master - prototype fix for mkdir  OK Michael, can you try to reproduce with this patch added.  I was able to reproduce your race without it, but once I added this patch I can't reproduce the issue anymore.  It adds wrapper functions:  safe_pathname_start() safe_pthname_end()  which I should be able to use to fix mkdir, symlink, mknod.  As I said, I need to do more work for symlink and link, but I think this shows how it can be done. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c7)  Jeremy Allison    2019-05-31 22:58:06 UTC  ``` Oh thank goodness, we still pass TESTS=raw.mkdir and TESTS=samba3.blackbox.shadow_copy2 with this patchset :-).  At SambaXP I'll see about making sure it passes on a private gitlab or catalyst CI run. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c8)  Jeremy Allison    2019-05-31 23:27:08 UTC  ``` Ah, hang on a minute. I am getting some crashes with this patch. Investigating.. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c9)  Jeremy Allison    2019-06-01 05:04:51 UTC  ``` Ah, OK - I think the crashes are the correct thing here.  What is happening is the python thread itself has a race where the "dest" directory sometimes doesn't exist:      if os.path.islink(dest):       os.unlink(dest)     elif os.path.isdir(dest):       shutil.rmtree(dest)  <---- Here "dest" doesn't exist for a time      os.mkdir(dest)     ev.set()     os.rename(dest, fordel)  <---- Here "dest" doesn't exist for a time      os.symlink("/tmp", dest)  Wht can happen is that we chdir() into "dest" (storing conn->cwd_fname = "/srv/data/dest") which exists, start doing the operation and then after the mkdir call succeeds call become_root()/unbecome_root() as part of the created directory post processing.  The unbecome_root() code then tries to chdir("/srv/data/dest") on popping the connection context stack (after all, we just created /srv/data/dest/shouldnotexist.timestamp, right !) and at this point "src/data/dest" doesn't exist (it's been deleted or moved etc.).  pop_conn_ctx() treats this as a panic error - see below:         /*          * Check if the current context did a chdir_current_service()          * and restore the cwd_fname of the previous context          * if needed.          */         if (current_user.done_chdir && ctx_p->need_chdir) {                 int ret;                  ret = vfs_ChDir(ctx_p->conn, ctx_p->conn->cwd_fname);                 if (ret != 0) {                         DBG_ERR("vfs_ChDir() failed!\n");                         smb_panic("vfs_ChDir() failed!\n");                 }         }  which IMHO is a reasonable decision. If the chdir() back to where we were we fails we don't know where we are in the filesystem and can't continue to process calls.  Looks like a self-inflicted wound at this point and it's reasonable to panic.  So I think my fix is good for the mkdir case (even though it causes an smbd crash), smbd is simply not designed for this kind of simultaneous manipulation of the tree by the same user. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c10)  Jeremy Allison    2019-06-01 05:12:53 UTC  ``` Yep, confirmed my suspicions by adding extra debug in the vfs_ChDir code:  [2019/05/31 22:10:21.639048,  0] ../../source3/smbd/vfs.c:811(vfs_ChDir)   vfs_ChDir: vfs_ChDir to /srv/data/dest No such file or directory [2019/05/31 22:10:21.639898,  0] ../../source3/smbd/uid.c:586(pop_conn_ctx)   pop_conn_ctx: vfs_ChDir() failed!

I think the crash is acceptable in this case, as it would happen in the current "open()" code path (which does the same thing).

It depends on become_root()/unbecome_root() pairs only wrapping code that saves/restores any directory changes before returning.  Which luckily I think all of them do. Still looking at the usages. ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c14)  hansmi    2019-06-02 19:42:01 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 15213](attachment.cgi?id=15213 "Race reproduction script from June 2, 2019") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=15213&action=edit "Race reproduction script from June 2, 2019") Race reproduction script from June 2, 2019  > OK Michael, can you try to reproduce with this patch added.

Can't currently see how that can be happening once we've chdir()'ed into the target directory, checked it's under the share export and then do a "mkdir("./shouldnotexist.<timestamp>") only from within the chdir()'ed directory.  We are no longer doing mkdir() calls with anything but a single element path from inside the current directory.  Being inside the current $cwd should prevent a rename and symlink of the path above from having any effect.

Figured it out trying to get to sleep on the plane :-), so had to buy wifi to report this.  We should not be calling the chdir() just before the mkdir(), the reason we are is a bug in unbecome_root() which is triggering a chdir() which should be skipped.

That created the new race you found, as the inheritance calculations call a code path that uses become_root()/unbecome_root().  The initial check for being under the share path using realpath inside safe_pathname_start() is actually good, and does catch a symlink racer, but the problem is in the unbecome-root() code it can call chdir(conn->old_cwd) *again*, after the correct check. That then opens up the symlink redirect race again that we just protected ourselves against.  My new patch eliminates that chdir() in the unbecome root code, leaving the initial check as a  direct check.  I think this is the correct fix, as become_root()/unbecome_root() pairs should only be changing credentials, not directories. We only didn't notice it was doing so before as a side effect of code reuse as it was doing a (considered harmless) chdir($cwd).  As I say, I have an updated fix I'll upload once I'm on the ground.

After reading a bit more code I suspect all or most cases where more than a mere filename is passed to system calls is susceptible, e.g.:  * SMB_VFS_CHMOD used by file_set_dosmode calls chmod(smb_fname->base_name, mode). * Most xattr functions, also used by file_set_dosmode, are similar in that they don't operate on file descriptors.

We may not be able to fully harden the XATTR calls. ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c34)  Jeremy Allison    2019-06-06 13:59:14 UTC  ``` OK, I think I have a plan to proceed. I'm planning to remove all use of VFS_CHMOD() calls from Samba, due to it being unsafe to use on Linux (fchmod requires a real file descriptor, which would break the kernel oplocks) by restructuring some code to insist on file handles instead of pathnames.  Also remove the set_acl_XXXX() calls and use fset_acl_XXX() calls instead as we can insist that opening a handle for WRITE_DAC|READ_CONTROL|WRITE_OWNER open a real fd underneath (these access masks already break oplocks, so it's safe for kernel oplocks).  Secondly I think we can change all the get/set/listxattr calls with their lget/lset/llist alternatives *below* the VFS layer (at the syscall layer). The reason for this is that we already don't work on Windows calls made against symlink last-component targets - as we never call VFS_CHOWN, we only *ever* call VFS_LCHOWN which doesn't follow symlinks on last component.  Given that, I think I can start to bleed fixes into the master tree as 'normal' bugfixes to do preparatory work for the security fix.  Eventually, get to the point where I can add in the safe_pathname_start()/safe_pathname_end() calls to wrap the multiple-component paths and really fix this.  This is going to take a while I think, so I'll start to send in the first preparatory patches in the next few weeks, and keep building towards a complete fix. ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c35)  Jeremy Allison    2019-06-13 16:56:56 UTC  ``` I think I'm going to log bugs for the prerequisite patches, and make this bug a dependency on them.

Essentially the design we came up with was SMB_VFS_CREATE_FILE() saving us by returning an fsp for the containing directory for any pathname that we then pass to all existing pathname-based calls such as ret = LSTATAT(fsp, smb_fname);  However, SMB_VFS_CREATE_FILE() itself can't take an fsp for the containing directory, as we then have a chicken and egg problem - it still has to operate on paths relative to the current $cwd.  So the pathname calls we use in the codepaths called from inside SMB_VFS_CREATE_FILE() can't take an fsp, as we don't have one yet. This isn't a problem with the code inside there to open the file descriptor, as it's written to be symlink safe.  So we have to SMB_VFS_CHDIR() (which will be a remaining pathname based call with no fsp) to the containing directory, and then use the fd_open wrapper call (again, not taking an fsp as it's symlink safe) in order to get a fd on the "." directory, then fake up an fsp pointer to pass into the pathname calls.  The POSIX syscalls fix this by having a special AT_CWD parameter to be used meaning current directory when an application has no file descriptor to be relative to.  Should we create the fake-fsp for "." inside SMB_VFS_CREATE_FILE(), or pass in a special pointer value (possibly not NULL so we can better detect programming errors) that is the equivalent of FSP_AT_CWD ?  This adding complexity which I was hoping to avoid, but I don't see any other way around the chicken-and-egg issue with SMB_VFS_CREATE_FILE(), can you all ?

That means walking the pathname component by component every time, which I was hoping to avoid. If we have to, we have to though.  It would mean doing the inital stat-cache lookup given the client passed-in pathname, to try and avoid any directory searches, then starting from the fake fsp share root open directories step by step down the path, no enumerating them unless an open on the next path component fails, returning the last parent directory handle fsp as well as the last component.  Means a rewrite of unix_convert though, but I'm guessing that's going to be on the cards whatever we chose :-(.  We could cache the open directory handles on the connection struct for the share. We'd have to have some heuristic for closing them though, otherwise we're going to drown in opened fsp handles. As most filesystem access tends to be localized in a single directory (except for special cases like tree traveral for backup or ACL modificaion) that shouldn't be so bad.  That would mean SMB_VFS_CREATE_FILE() takes a parent_fsp pointer, always. We then pass in only the last component name to SMB_VFS_CREATE_FILE(), relative to parent_fsp. To keep the logic around fsp->fsp_name untouched we'd then need to store the combination of:  parent_fsp->fsp_name + last_component name as the fsp_name of the being created fsp.

Thinking a little more, to create a fake fsp for the share root we still need to be able to do:  int fd = SMB_VFS_OPENAT(conn, SMB_AT_CWD, smb_fname, mode);  inside the 'create_fake_fsp' code.  - the SMB_AT_CWD removes the chicken and egg problem when creating the fake_share_root_fsp->fh->fd value.

I'm also adding Jeff Layton to the CC list, who's the Linux CephFS maintainer. Regarding the lack of ceph_fdopendir(). We may be able to instead use the "low-level" cephFS API to pin parent directories before child creation. Both ceph_ll_create() and ceph_ll_mkdir() accept a parent inode pointer alongside the child name. The ceph_ll_walk() AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW flag looks like it also might be helpful, but there's next to no documentation for these low-level functions, so I'll need some time to take a closer look. ```  [Comment 62](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c62)  Jeremy Allison    2019-07-08 17:43:54 UTC  ``` > Regarding the lack of ceph_fdopendir().

We need to fix all pathname useages in the fileserver to be symlink race safe.  I've already changed the open file code to always get a real file descriptor when opening a directory (via the symlink-race safe fd_open(path, O_DIRECTORY) - in my next set of changes I wanted to remove the calls to open_dir_safely() -> OpenDir_internal() inside of source3/smbd/dir.c and leave us with only the file-descriptor versions of reading a directory. open_dir_safely() is symlink-race safe but is costly and has to do vfs_ChDir() calls and adds a lot of complexity to the directory handling.  If you can help me move this inside of the vfs_ceph.c module until ceph gets a working ceph_fdopendir() call then I can simplify our directory handling code *significantly* (I'm already planning to remove the SMB1 reply_search() caching of partially open directory handles insanity).

I've nearly finished a patchset moving all directory enumeration to be handle based rather than path based, which is a prerequisite, but there's lots more to be done.  However, we can split this bug into two components.  1). mkdir escape - this is the most important error as it can allow object creation outside of the share definition.

It's slightly risky as any attention in this area may put a spotlight on things we can't yet fix, but if we bundle this with the other CVE that is less likely.

This is too large to do in private, so I'm doing this in public under the guise of "modernising the VFS to use handle-based operations" (without saying explicitly *why* I'm doing so).  Table stakes here is to move all our VFS operations to the XXXXAT() style of interface, so that's what I'm trying to do as rapidly as possible.  What I need right now is help and review on these code changes (which are explicitly *not* changing our current pathname logic, just migrating the interfaces from things like : SMB_VFS_RENAME -> SMB_VFS_RENAMEAT whilst using the magic SMB_VFS_AT_FDCWD value as the srcfsp or dstfsp pointer value to mean the same as the syscall AT_FDCWD value which means "do this in the current directory".  Once all our VFS operations are updated to use this approach, then we have the ability to actually go on and fix the problem.  But make no mistakes, fixing it is going to be really hard as there is so much existing code in existing VFS modules like shadow_copy2, fruit, virusscanner, recycle, streams_depot etc. that expects incoming pathnames to be $CWD + smb_fname_share_relative_path.  Changing this to work and keep all our tests working to cope with :  cwd_fsp + smb_fname_last_component_path  is going to be really difficult. As smb_fname already has a value for:          char *original_lcomp;  I'm thinking of maybe keeping the existing smb_fname_share_relative_path in:          char *base_name;         char *stream_name;  and using original_lcomp as the last component relative pointer to the component in "base_name" after any last '/' character in order to avoid all the horrendous extra string manipulations we'll need.  But without SMB_VFS_XXXXXAT() we're not even in the place where we can start on that yet.  So right now the help I really want is doing the boilerplate VFS code updates (or even just rapid code review, I know what needs doing and can crank out this code myself if needed) to get us to SMB_VFS_XXXXXAT(). -------------------------------------------------------------- ```  [Comment 69](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c69)  Jeremy Allison    2019-09-04 00:07:03 UTC  ``` Just an update - migration of the VFS in master to XXXat() calls is ongoing.

SMB_VFS_CHOWN (pathname based) removal is the next one awaiting review.  I have one design decision I'd like to make though.  Currently we have a parameter "widelinks = [yes|no]" which we use to allow symlinks to escape from a share definition or not.  Yes I know it's insane, but there are existing customers out there using this, and I'd like to break as little as possible going forward.  What I'd like to do is remove the "widelinks =" parameter and replace it with a non-stackable VFS module vfs_widelinks.  This would then remove the AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW flags on any passed in SMB_VFS_XXXAT() calls which will implicitly make symlinks become invisible to the upper layer code.  I'd need to also change the SMB_VFS_REALPATH call to always return the absolute path created by appending the share definition path with the path passed in to realpath (again making it appear that symlinks don't exist and are always followed).  If I can confine this to one VFS module, then I can change the rest of the server to never follow  symlinks outside the share without having to add lots of 'unless widelinks = yes' logic all over the place (look at the existing code inside the fd_open() code inside source3/smbd/open.c for an example of the what effect this has).  Essentially I can then ignore the little-used widelinks option whilst still allowing people who depend on this to add a VFS module that closely (probably not 100% identically) reproduces the old behavior.  This will simplify the make all pathnames safe logic immensely.  I'd need to (soon, before next release) mark the 'widelinks' parameter as deprecated and soon for removal if everyone agrees with this.

That way the number of sites impacted is much less, most will have a default vfs objects and widelinks be in it.  What I propose is that the parameter remain, but would control if that module did anything (or instead, did nothing).   We would still have a upgrade challenge for sites with a vfs objects value set (so the new default wouldn't help), but the combination of those who also had wide links set will be far fewer. ```  [Comment 74](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c74)  Jeremy Allison    2019-10-13 02:11:32 UTC  ``` > Why not keep the parameter, but have it simply control the behaviour of the > widelinks VFS module?   Because I'm not suggesting that the widelinks vfs module be loaded by default, that would be a very bad idea. The widelinks module I'm proposing will touch the core functionality inside fstatat, realpath and readdirplus which I really don't want in the 'normal' VFS code paths.  So when I move the widelinks behavior into the module and out of the core smbd code (which is the only sane way to fix this thing) then having the parameter as well is an extra switch controling exactly what loading the module already does.  Allowing wide links is a very strange behavior, I wish we'd never allowed it.  The number of sites that use/need wide links IMHO is small enough that on upgrade asking them to add a vfs objects entry to shares that require it instead seems to be a small mandatory change to insist on.  If we leave the parameter alone, then the sites that used it won't understand why the functionality stops working when the parameter is set because they didn't notice they also need to add 'vfs objects = widelinks'.  Does that help explain my reasoning ? ```  [Comment 75](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c75)  Ralph Böhme    2019-10-13 06:31:04 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jeremy Allison from [comment #72](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c72)) I like the idea of moving the behaviour to the VFS, but I'd prefer to not add a VFS module and if possible do it in vfs.c with a macro  # define SMB_VFS_AT_FLAGS(handle, flags) \     if (handle == handle->conn->vfs_handles) { \ ```  [Comment 76](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c76)  Andrew Bartlett    2019-10-13 06:32:39 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jeremy Allison from [comment #74](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c74)) I understand the reasoning, I just disagree as to the breaking change, because I think there is a way to keep existing configurations working.  So, I think that we should try to is either have the 'vfs defaults' change based on 'wide links' or have the default static but have the widelinks module be a no-op when 'wide links = no'.  This is just a matter of how the module comes to be configured, not the core design you are trying to advance.

There are a lot of them. I think this is a bad idea and adds extra complexity, not to mention the extra code / time added for these tests and if statements on every VFS call.  It's extra complexity we simply don't need if we make this an optional module. Complexity is the enemy of security.  That way the default is complete symlink safety.  1). All smbd logic is written such that smbd refuses to allow access outside the share. I can't stress this enough being the correct design in terms of long-term maintainability. Compromise here is not a good idea.  2). For people who want insecurity, all of the logic that allows insecurity is concentrated in one optionally loaded module which causes the upper layer smbd to be blind to the existence of underlying symlinks, vfs_widelinks.  This is (IMHO) much clearer and simpler to code and to maintain in the long run. It isolates the logic on one place, not smearing it out all over the core smbd code.  Backwards parameter compatibility for insane parameters like this will kill us for maintainability and code simplicity in the long run.  We are already changing a lot for this fix, insisting on a new module being added only for people who want insecurity is not IMHO unreasonable.  Adding this module as part of the default stack I also disagree with, again due to the extra code being added into every VFS call.  The ability to compromise security like this isn't something that should be built into the default code path, it really needs to be an optional loaded module.  I really don't want to code this up the way you both have suggested, I think it's a bad idea for maintainability.  It isn't worth it for the number of people affected by this change.  This decision doesn't have to be made now, as the VFS code changes are still going in. But once they are done and the shape of the new VFS is done, at that point we have to make the changes to fix the symlink escapes.  I disagree with keeping the widelinks parameter and logic inside smbd so much I'm unwilling to do further work on this bug if I'm required to maintain it. It's simply costing me too much stress in coming up with a working design. Removing widelinks from the core code paths allowed me to see a way forward to a complete and clean fix in core smbd. It really does have to be in a vfs module simply to isolate the problem. If keeping it is mandatory then others will have to do this work, sorry. ```  [Comment 80](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c80)  Jeremy Allison    2019-10-13 17:12:51 UTC  ``` One more wrinkle. Causing smbd to not see symlinks will break MS-DFS redirects as they depend on exposing symlinks to the code in source3/smbd/msdfs.c.

Long term we need to migrate ms-dfs link storage to EA's (the same way Micosoft does it).  symlinks really are a cancer inside filesystem design. ```  [Comment 81](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c81)  Jeremy Allison    2019-10-13 17:34:12 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jeremy Allison from [comment #80](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c80))  As we're making big VFS changes, we should probably also add 2 new VFS calls:  NTSTATUS SMB_VFS_MSDFS_READLINKAT(struct vfs_handle_struct *handle,                                   struct files_struct *dirfsp,                                   const struct smb_filename *smb_fname,                                   char *buf,                                   size_t bufsiz); NTSTATUS SMB_VFS_MSDFS_CREATELINKAT(struct vfs_handle_struct *handle,                                   struct files_struct *dirfsp,                                   const struct smb_filename *smb_fname,                                   char *path);  SMB_VFS_MSDFS_READLINKAT returns NT_STATUS_OBJECT_PATH_NOT_FOUND if called on a non-DFS path (i.e. not a symlink). Then way we move the existing logic that stores dfs paths in symlinks into the underlying filesystem code.  This still won't fix the widelinks MS-DFS case, as for that unix_convert() depends upon returning a SMB_STRUCT_STAT_EX struct with S_ISLNK set in order to the MS-DFS detection logic to kick in later.  Another reason why losing widelinks logic from the main code is a good idea. There's no way I can see to maintain widelinks logic, MSDFS paths stored in symlinks and symlink safety in one single codepath. ```  [Comment 82](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c82)  Jeremy Allison    2019-10-13 17:43:00 UTC  ``` (In reply to Andrew Bartlett from [comment #76](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c76))  > This way we: > > * avoid needing to deprecate the parameter (and all the notice stuff that goes with that) >  * avoid breaking sites that only upgrade Samba when the whole OS is upgraded (and never read our see our release notes) > Is this clearer?  If you don't want to deprecate the parameter, I'm willing to consider keeping it so long as its only function is to issue an error message (or warning message) saying widelinks won't work unless the vfs_widelinks module is loaded for this share.  Is that a compromise you can live with ? ```  [Comment 83](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c83)  Jeremy Allison    2019-10-13 18:11:04 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jeremy Allison from [comment #81](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c81))  > This still won't fix the widelinks MS-DFS case, as for that unix_convert()  > depends upon returning a SMB_STRUCT_STAT_EX struct with S_ISLNK set in order to  > the MS-DFS detection logic to kick in later.  Aha ! Looking carefully the above is not correct. In MS-DFS it depends on unix_convert() returning ENOENT -> NT_STATUS_OBJECT_PATH_NOT_FOUND to trigger the MS-DFS component search. That means vfs_widelinks *would* still work with MS-DFS so long as we have the extra VFS call SMB_VFS_MSDFS_READLINKAT() that has an  implementation inside vfs_widelinks that does the LSTAT()/READLINK() calls internally to check for MS-DFS objects stored in links.  The initial pathname conversion on a MS-DFS symlink foo where (foo -> msdfs:\\dfs\redirect\path) does an unconditional STAT() call, gets ENOENT which then triggers the DFS pathname walk using SMB_VFS_MSDFS_READLINKAT() to check for MS-DFS components.  The vfs_widelinks module design is looking better and better :-). Seems like we can still have our cake and eat it :-). ```  [Comment 84](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c84)  Andrew Bartlett    2019-10-13 22:40:05 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jeremy Allison from [comment #82](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c82)) I think fundamentally changing a parameter into a warning message is the same as removing it, so I don't think our historical practice permits that.   The AD DC sets different default VFS objects based on a parameter, why can't we do that?  But better still would be having this be an implicit top-level module (or such) that becomes a no-op if the option is unset. ```  [Comment 85](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c85)  Jeremy Allison    2019-10-13 23:02:33 UTC  ``` (In reply to Andrew Bartlett from [comment #84](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c84))  > The AD DC sets different default VFS objects based on a parameter, why can't we > do that?  I will take a look, that might be possible.  > But better still would be having this be an implicit top-level module (or such) > that becomes a no-op if the option is unset.  No, sorry I fundamentally disagree with that. Having "break all security" as an implicit top-level module is *NOT* a good idea going forward. It makes far more sense to have it as a completely optional loaded module for the small number of users who depend on it.  I don't understand why I can't just remove this parameter - deprecating it first as I suggested. This is going to be a massive security release - the biggest one we've ever had to do. It's a fileserver *rewrite*. Please think about the implications of that.  As I said, I'm coming to the conclusion that I need to do this, and just break backwards compatibility.  This is difficult enough to do as it is, please don't make it worse by adding additional hoops to jump through to keep old insane options working without change. I'm getting to the point of just walking away from this I'm afraid. ```  [Comment 86](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c86)  Jeremy Allison    2019-10-13 23:03:28 UTC  ``` Separate email from Volker:  Haven't read all of the discussion in every detail, but you have my full support for removing the wide links parameter and putting that into a module.

I don't think this will work if the user already has vfs objects set.  I'm also ok with making this an optional module that has to be explicitly enabled. And then it indeed makes no sense to keep the "wide links" option as it won't work as advertized unless the module is in the stack.  So +1 on deprecating and the module. ```  [Comment 88](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c88)  Andrew Bartlett    2019-10-21 06:08:21 UTC  ``` I attended Kawaiicon this year and watched as a "safe" limited shell was escaped via a symlink from the restricted directory to the root.  Not directly Samba, but the same idea.  It was enough to make me rethink my position here.    I think that the use case for 'wide links' can be reimplemented with bind mounts if really needed, so we should deprecate 'wide links' and strongly discourage even the use of the replacement module. ```  [Comment 89](show_bug.cgi?id=13979#c89)  Björn Jacke    2019-10-21 11:27:57 UTC  ``` On 21.10.19 08:08, samba-bugs@samba.org wrote: > I think that the use case for 'wide links' can be reimplemented with bind > mounts  have in mind that bind mounts are a Linux feature and there are definetely other Unix-like flavours which do not have something like that.

Ralph, can you take a look at this one ? It's a patchset inspired by the original fix I showed you at SambaXP that causes opening a file for get/set ACL to open a real file handle. It is mostly code cleanup but makes our POSIX ACL code consistent and handle based. Adds a test to show correct behavior also.

Cheers,

Jeremy.
