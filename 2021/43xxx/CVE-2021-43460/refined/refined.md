Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-43460:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The System Explorer 7.0.0 software has an unquoted service path vulnerability in the `SystemExplorerHelpService` service.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unquoted Service Path:** The binary path for the `SystemExplorerHelpService` service is not enclosed in quotes. This allows an attacker to potentially insert malicious executables into higher-level directories within the path, which will be executed when the service is started. The vulnerable path is: `C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer\service\SystemExplorerService64.exe`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges (LocalSystem) during system startup or reboot.
- **System Compromise:** This can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local access required:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **Malicious file creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious executable in a directory along the service path, such as `C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer\service\` or `C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer\`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have local user access to the vulnerable machine and sufficient permissions to write files in a location that is part of the unquoted service path, likely `C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer`.
- No special privileges are required to cause a vulnerable service to start. A system restart may be required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit-db content indicates that this vulnerability is a local privilege escalation issue.
- The github content references the exploit-db entry related to CVE-2021-43460.
