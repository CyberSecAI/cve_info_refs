- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The KAON CG3000 router, specifically the software version 1.00.67, lacks proper access control for reading and updating device configurations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Missing Authentication:** The router allows access to its configuration, specifically the WiFi settings, through HTTP endpoints without requiring any authentication. Both GET requests to read the configuration and POST requests to change it are affected.
    - **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The use of direct, predictable URLs like `/section/wlswitchint1wi-fi-rede-principal.wl` and `/section/wlswitchint0wi-fi-rede-principal.wl` to access configuration data indicates a lack of access control implementation.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** Attackers can retrieve the current WiFi configuration (SSID, password, etc.) without authentication.
    - **Unauthorized Modification:** Attackers can modify the router's WiFi configuration (SSID, password, visibility) without authentication, potentially disrupting network services or gaining unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - **Network-based:** An attacker connected to the same network as the vulnerable router can exploit this flaw.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the router. No special credentials or privileged access is necessary.
