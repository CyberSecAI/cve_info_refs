Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43510:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `classes/Login.php` file of the Simple Client Management System.
- User-supplied input from the login form is directly passed into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The direct injection of user input into the SQL query allows for manipulation of the query logic. Specifically, the `$_POST['username']` and `$_POST['password']` variables are concatenated directly into the query. This makes the system vulnerable to SQL Injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** By crafting a specific SQL injection payload, an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the admin panel.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the login form, specifically the username and password input fields.
- An attacker injects malicious SQL code via these input fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the login form of the application.
- They must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the login page with the crafted SQL injection payload in the username and/or password parameters.

**Technical Details**
- The vulnerable code in `classes/Login.php` is as follows:
```php
$username = $_POST['username'];
$password = $_POST['password'];

$qry = "SELECT * FROM admin WHERE username = '$username' and password = '$password'";

```

- The attacker can use the following payload to bypass authentication: `admin'+or+'1'%3D'1'--+-`
- This payload exploits the SQL injection vulnerability, where the `or '1'='1'` condition is always true, effectively bypassing the original username and password check.
