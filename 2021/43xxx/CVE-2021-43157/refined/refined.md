The provided content relates to CVE-2021-43157.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of input validation for the `id` parameter in the `cart_remove.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is SQL injection. The application does not sanitize or validate the input received via the `id` parameter, leading to direct execution of attacker-controlled SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this SQL injection vulnerability can lead to several impacts, including:
*   **Data exfiltration:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials, product information, or customer details.
*   **Data modification:** An attacker can modify or delete data in the database, causing disruption of the application and potential data loss.
*   **Privilege escalation:** Depending on the database configuration and the user context of the application, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the database server or even the underlying operating system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `cart_remove.php` page via a crafted GET request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server where the vulnerable application is hosted. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
