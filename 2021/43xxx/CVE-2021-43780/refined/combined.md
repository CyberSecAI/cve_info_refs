# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Redash

Moderate

[arikfr](/arikfr)
published
GHSA-fcpv-hgq6-87h7
Nov 23, 2021

## Package

Redash
(Redash)

## Affected versions

<= 10.0

## Patched versions

10.1

## Description

### Impact

The current implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled.

Our thanks to Ian Carroll ([@iangcarroll](https://github.com/iangcarroll) on Github) for responsibly disclosing this vulnerability.

### Patches

The current `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the [Advocate library](https://github.com/JordanMilne/Advocate) for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.1 to receive this patch. For Docker installations, you can upgrade to Docker Tag `redash/redash:10.1.0.b50633`.

### Workarounds

To mitigate the vulnerability without upgrading:

1. You can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to your configuration. This will make them unavailable inside the webapp.

```
REDASH_DISABLED_QUERY_RUNNERS = "redash.query_runner.excel,redash.query_runner.csv,redash.query_runner.json_ds,redash.query_runner.url,redash.query_runner.drill,redash.query_runner.jira"
```

2. You can switch any data source of the following types to be "View Only" for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen:

* JSON
* CSV
* Excel
* Apache Drill
* Jira
* URL

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-43780

### Weaknesses

[CWE-918](/advisories?query=cwe%3A918)
