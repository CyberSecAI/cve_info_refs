Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-43986:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper access control: The setup program for FANUC ROBOGUIDE configures files and folders with full access permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The software's configuration allows unauthorized users to potentially replace original binaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to replace original binaries and escalate privileges on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: Exploitation requires local access to the system where FANUC ROBOGUIDE is installed.
- User interaction: The attacker would likely need to interact with the system, probably with user level access, to exploit this.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Low Privileges: Attackers need to have at least some access to the target system (e.g., user level) with the ability to run programs.
- Local System Access: The attacker must be able to access the file system of the machine running the software.
- Requires some manual actions: The attacker needs to perform actions such as replacing binaries in the affected file/folder path.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.0 with a vector string of AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H.
-  The document also includes the following disclaimer: "This offline simulation software program does not provide any control or management of physical devices or processes. It is included because it is used in Industrial Control Systems (ICS)."
