Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43821:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Opencast Ingest Service allowing the inclusion of local file URLs in ingested media packages. Specifically, the `IngestServiceImpl.java` file, prior to version 10.6, would directly open and include local files based on the provided file URI.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Local File Inclusion:** The primary weakness is the ability to reference and include local files from the Opencast server's file system within a media package being ingested.
- **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The ingest service did not properly validate or sanitize the provided URIs, allowing `file://` URIs to be processed and opened.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker could include any local file that the Opencast process has read access to, effectively granting them access to potentially sensitive information.
- **Information Disclosure:** This could lead to the extraction of secrets, configuration files, or other confidential data from the server.
- **Server Compromise:** Depending on the contents of accessible files, this could lead to further exploitation or compromise of the server.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Ingest Service API:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the Opencast ingest service API.
- **Manipulated Media Packages:** Attackers can craft malicious media packages with `file://` URIs pointing to sensitive files.
- **Media URI Parameter:** The `mediaUri` parameter during ingest is the specific attack vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have the necessary privileges to add media packages to the system, although these privileges are often widely granted.
- **Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker would require some knowledge of the target file paths on the Opencast server's file system.

**Additional Details (beyond official CVE description):**
- The provided code snippets show the exact lines of code that were vulnerable and how they were patched.
- The vulnerability is located in `IngestServiceImpl.java` at the method `addContentToRepo`.
- The fix restricts the fetching of files from the local filesystem by adding a check for `!uri.toString().startsWith("file")` and throwing an `IOException` if a `file://` URI is encountered.
- A test case was added to `IngestServiceImplTest.java` to ensure that local file system URIs are actively rejected.
- A workaround of narrowing read access via Unix permissions or Mandatory Access Control is suggested, but is not a complete solution.
- The affected versions are < 10.6
- Patched versions are 10.6 and 11.0
