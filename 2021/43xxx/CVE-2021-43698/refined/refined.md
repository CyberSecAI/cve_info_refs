Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43698:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `example.php` file of the `phpWhois` library. Specifically, the value of the `query` parameter from the `$_GET` array is directly incorporated into the output without any encoding or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The script takes the user's input from the `query` parameter via the `$_GET` array and embeds this directly into the HTML output.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page by crafting a malicious URL with the `query` parameter set to the malicious JavaScript payload. This injected script could then execute in the context of the user's browser when they access the vulnerable page.
- This can lead to a range of malicious activities, including:
   - Session hijacking
   - Stealing cookies
   - Redirecting users to malicious websites
   - Defacement of the vulnerable website
   - Phishing attacks, etc.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes a malicious script within the `query` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that includes the malicious JavaScript as the value of the `query` parameter. They must then entice a user to click on the link or otherwise execute the crafted request to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is within `example.php`, specifically lines 38, 64, 111, and 117, which are described in the github issue.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-43698.
- The issue was reported in the project's issue tracker [sparc/phpWhois.org#21](https://github.com/sparc/phpWhois.org/issues/21), and has been marked as fixed.
- The severity of the vulnerability is considered "moderate".
- The fix was applied by the project owner `sparc` on Feb 22, 2022.
