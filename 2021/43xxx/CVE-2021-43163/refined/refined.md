Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-43163:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from command injection in the `checkNet` function within the `/cgi-bin/luci/api/auth` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The `checkNet` function improperly handles input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.
- **Pre-authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device. This could lead to complete compromise of the router, including data exfiltration, denial of service, or further network attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** An attacker can send a malicious HTTP request to the `/cgi-bin/luci/api/auth` endpoint, specifically targeting the vulnerable `checkNet` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable router. This could be from the local network or, if the router's management interface is exposed, from the internet.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is pre-authenticated, meaning the attacker does not need any valid credentials to exploit it.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Ruijie RG-EW Series Routers up to ReyeeOS 1.55.1915 / EW_3.0(1)B11P55.
- The vulnerable code is located in `/usr/lib/lua/luci/modules/noauth.lua` within the `checkNet` function.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Minh Khoa of VSEC.
- The vulnerability was tested on Ruijie RG-EW1200, Ruijie RG-EW1200G PRO models.
