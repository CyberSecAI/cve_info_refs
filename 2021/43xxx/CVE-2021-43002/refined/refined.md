The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-43002, found in the Eltima SDK and its derivatives used for USB over Ethernet functionality in various cloud services.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is improper handling of user-provided buffers within the `wspvuhub.sys` and `wspusbfilter.sys` drivers. Specifically, the IOCTL handlers 0x22005B and 0x22001B use the `METHOD_NEITHER` method for data transfer, which does not automatically validate user-supplied buffers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The code performs insecure arithmetic operations on user-controlled data without any overflow checks when calculating the `memmove` size parameter.
- **Missing Buffer Validation:** The IOCTL handler lacks proper validation, probing, locking, and mapping of user-provided buffers.
- **Double Fetches and Arbitrary Pointer Dereference:** The missing buffer validation opens up possibilities for double fetches and arbitrary pointer dereferences.
- **Lack of ACL Enforcements:** The driver accepts IOCTLs without ACL enforcements, meaning access isn't properly restricted.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can escalate privileges and execute code in kernel mode.
- **Bypass Security Products:** Attackers can bypass security products by running code in kernel mode.
- **System Corruption:** Vulnerabilities can lead to overwriting system components or corrupting the operating system.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The ability to overwrite memory in kernel mode can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability can cause a Blue Screen of Death (BSoD).

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted IRPs (I/O Request Packets) sent via `DeviceIoControl` with malicious parameters
- Local privilege escalation by exploiting the vulnerable drivers.
- Second stage browser attack or through other sandboxes due to the lack of ACL enforcement on the device

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have the ability to send crafted IOCTL requests to the vulnerable device driver.
- Local access to a vulnerable system is required to leverage the privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
- The article suggests it might be exploitable from sandboxes or as a second stage browser attack.
