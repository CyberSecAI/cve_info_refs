  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application embeds database credentials of a software administrator user into its binary files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Hardcoded credentials",
      "Insecure storage of credentials"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with access to the application's binary files can extract the embedded database credentials. This allows the attacker to access a large amount of data and perform read, update, and delete operations on the database. All instances of the software use the same credentials, meaning that a single compromise can grant access to all databases linked to vulnerable instances.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Access to the application's binary files"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs access to the application's binary files in order to extract the database credentials. No network access is mentioned as a requirement, so access is likely local, though the impact is broad because multiple instances share the same credentials."
