Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-43337:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the access control rules within SlurmDBD when the `AccountingStoreFlags=job_script` and/or `job_env` options are enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The access control rules in SlurmDBD were not properly implemented, allowing users to potentially request job scripts and environment files that they should not have access to.
- **Bypass of Intended Restrictions:** The system intended for scripts and environments to be accessible only by administrator users, account coordinators for jobs under their account, and the user themselves. However, the flawed access control allowed other users to bypass these restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive job scripts and environment files, potentially revealing configuration details, secrets, or other confidential information related to jobs submitted by other users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited via the SlurmDBD component.
- The specific attack vector involves making requests to SlurmDBD for job scripts and environment files that a user should not normally be able to access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be a user on the Slurm system.
- The attacker would need to be aware of the new `AccountingStoreFlags=job_script` and/or `job_env` options being enabled on the Slurm system.
- The attacker would need to be able to make requests to SlurmDBD, which is typically a server-side component of Slurm.

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability is specific to the Slurm 21.08 release series and does not affect versions 20.11 and older.
- SchedMD customers were notified about this issue on November 2, 2021, and a fix was provided to them before the public release.
- The fix for this issue was included in Slurm version 21.08.4.
