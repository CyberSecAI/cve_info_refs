# Potential null pointer dereference when using JWT filter safe\_regex match

Moderate

[mattklein123](/mattklein123)
published
GHSA-vj5m-rch8-5r2p
Feb 22, 2022

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

V1.21.0 and earlier

## Patched versions

1.18.6, 1.19.3, 1.20.2, 1.21.1

## Description

CVSS Score 6.5 [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H&version=3.1), Medium

A crafted request crashes Envoy configured with JWT filter safe\_regex match

### Impact

Denial of Service (crash)

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

### Workarounds

Not use safe\_regex for JWT filter

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

|  |  | \* access\_log: fix memory leak when reopening an access log fails. Access logs will now try to be reopened on each subsequent flush attempt after a failure. |
|  |  | \* data plane: fixing error handling where writing to a socket failed while under the stack of processing. This should genreally affect HTTP/3. This behavioral change can be reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable\_features.allow\_upstream\_inline\_write`` to false. |
