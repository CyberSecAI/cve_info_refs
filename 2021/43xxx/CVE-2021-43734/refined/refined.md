Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `getCorsFile` method in `OnlinePreviewController.java` not properly validating the `urlPath` parameter, allowing it to accept the `file://` protocol.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** The application directly uses the provided `urlPath` to construct a URL and download content without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to specify local file paths using the `file://` protocol, leading to the reading of arbitrary files on the server.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate the protocol of the `urlPath`, allowing the use of the `file://` protocol when it should only be handling URLs for web resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive data such as configuration files, credentials, and other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/getCorsFile` endpoint with a `urlPath` parameter containing a `file://` URL pointing to the desired file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of API Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the `/getCorsFile` endpoint and how to supply the `urlPath` parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was reported against `kkFileView` version 4.0.0.
- The proof of concept (PoC) provided in the issue uses `<https://file.keking.cn/getCorsFile?urlPath=file:///etc/passwd>` to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was patched by implementing a check to disallow the use of the file protocol, and by ensuring the `urlPath` starts with `http`.
