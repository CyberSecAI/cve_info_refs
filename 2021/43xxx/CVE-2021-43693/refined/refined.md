Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-43693:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `_translate()` function within `web/inc/i18n.php`. This function takes a language code as an argument and uses it to include a language-specific file. The vulnerability is due to the fact that the language code parameter is taken directly from user input, making file inclusion vulnerable to manipulation. Specifically, the vulnerable line is: `require_once($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."/inc/i18n/$l.php");`

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **File Inclusion:** The application is vulnerable to file inclusion because it incorporates user-controlled data into a file path. Specifically, the `$l` variable, derived from user input `$_POST['v_language']`, is used directly within a `require_once` statement. This allows an attacker to manipulate the language code `$l` to include arbitrary files from the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially include malicious files, leading to:
    - Remote code execution.
    - Information disclosure.
    - Denial of service.
- By manipulating the input, an attacker could include files that are not intended to be accessed, leading to various security breaches.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `v_language` POST parameter in the `web/add/user/index.php` script.
- An attacker could send a crafted POST request to this script with a malicious value for `v_language`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the `web/add/user/index.php` endpoint.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges other than the ability to interact with the vulnerable application interface.
