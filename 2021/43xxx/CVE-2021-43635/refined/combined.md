# Changelog

* **Fixed a code execution vulnerability** ([#8](https://github.com/jcv8000/Codex/issues/8)) with notebook names/page names. This could only happen if you typed in a malicious name yourself or downloaded a `save.json` file from someone else and put it in your save directory.
* **Using a code block with the "other" language doesn't freeze the editor anymore and highlights properly** ([#9](https://github.com/jcv8000/Codex/issues/9))
* The code language overlay now doesn't show if there's no language/other
* Added menu options and macros for Nim and OCaml (macros: `[nim]` and `[ocaml]`)
* Added a section in the "Basic Editing" doc about how to paste in images

### **[jcv8000](/jcv8000)** commented [Sep 10, 2021](#issuecomment-917160011)

| Thank you very much for letting me know about this. I've made it so that it sanitizes/escapes the notebook's name/icon text and page's name.  About disabling `nodeIntegration`, I'm going to do a project rewrite soon that will make the main/renderer processes interact the way they're supposed to do securely, and that'll include disabling `nodeIntegration`. But I just wanted to get this fix out quickly and that rewrite is gonna take a while |
