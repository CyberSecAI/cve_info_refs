Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the application logic of i3 International Annexxus cameras, specifically in how user permissions are handled. The application intends to restrict the creation of multiple administrative accounts, but this restriction can be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Improper server-side validation:** The application does not properly validate user permissions during PUT requests to the `UserPermission` endpoint.
*   **Use of dangerous HTTP verbs (PUT):** The application allows the use of the PUT method to modify user permissions, which is then exploited due to the lack of proper validation.
*   **Logic Flaw:** The application's logic incorrectly assumes that only the admin user can modify permissions. By directly targeting the endpoint and manipulating the parameters, the attacker can bypass the intended restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can create a second administrative account on the system, even if only a regular user is created initially by the default 'i3admin'. This can lead to:
    *   Full control over the camera system.
    *   Unauthorized access to video streams and recordings.
    *   Manipulation of device settings.
    *   Potential for further compromise of the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has network access to the vulnerable camera. This can be done either remotely or on the same local network.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to craft specific HTTP PUT requests with manipulated parameters targeting the `UserPermission` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the camera or have network access to it.
*   **Knowledge of the API endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the `UserPermission` endpoint and the expected format for making requests.
*   **Existing User Account:** The attacker needs a pre-existing account with at least 'viewer' or 'operator' permissions. This can be created by the default `i3admin` user

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Annexxus cameras, specifically V5.2.0 build 150317 (Ax46), V5.0.9 build 151106 (Ax68) and V5.0.9 build 150615 (Ax78).
*   The vulnerability can be exploited using HTTP PUT requests which are not properly validated by the server.
*   The provided PoC files `annexxus_logicflaw.txt` (not present) would contain more details for exploitation.
* The vendor was contacted, but there was no response leading to public disclosure of the vulnerability.
