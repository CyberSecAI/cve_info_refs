#### i3 International Annexxus Cameras Ax-n 5.2.0 Application Logic Flaw

Title: i3 International Annexxus Cameras Ax-n 5.2.0 Application Logic Flaw

Advisory ID: [ZSL-2021-5688](ZSL-2021-5688.php)

Type: Local/Remote

Impact: Logic Flaw

Risk: (1/5)

Release Date: 01.11.2021
##### Summary

The Annexxus camera 6MP provides 4 simultaneous,
independently controlled digital pan-tilt-zoom (ePTZ) video
streams, which may be recorded or viewed live as well as a
built-in microphone and speaker allowing two way communication.
##### Description

The application doesn't allow creation of more than one
administrator account on the system. This also applies for
deletion of the administrative account. The logic behind this
restriction can be bypassed by parameter manipulation using
dangerous verbs like PUT and DELETE and improper server-side
validation. Once a normal account with 'viewer' or 'operator'
permissions has been added by the default admin user 'i3admin',
a PUT request can be issued calling the 'UserPermission' endpoint
with the ID of created account and set it to 'admin' userType,
successfully adding a second administrative account.
