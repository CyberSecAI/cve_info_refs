**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-43963

**Synopsis:** Sync Gateway insecurely stores Couchbase Server bucket credentials.

**Impact:** Medium

**Products:** Couchbase Sync Gateway

**Affected Versions:** Sync Gateway

**Fix Version:** Sync Gateway 2.8.3

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Sync Gateway was found to be storing Couchbase Server bucket credentials in an insecure manner. This suggests the credentials may be stored in plaintext or using a weak encryption method.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure storage of sensitive credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially gain access to the stored Couchbase Server credentials, leading to unauthorized access to the Couchbase database and its data.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker could potentially gain access to the insecurely stored credentials if they have access to the Sync Gateway's file system, configuration files, or memory, depending on where and how the credentials are being stored.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need some level of access to the Sync Gateway environment. This could involve compromising the server, gaining access through a vulnerability, or by social engineering.
- Specific access requirements would depend on the exact method of insecure credential storage.
