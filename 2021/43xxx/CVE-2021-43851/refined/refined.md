Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43851:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation of the "group" and "status" parameters in HTTP POST requests within the Time Tracker application. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize these parameters before using them in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, arising from the direct use of unsanitized user-supplied input in SQL queries. This is present in multiple files, but specifically mentioned in `groups.php`, where the "group" parameter was vulnerable and in other files, where the "status" parameter was vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could manipulate the "group" or "status" parameters to inject malicious SQL code.
- Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to bypass authentication, access sensitive data, modify or delete data, or even potentially gain control of the underlying database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted HTTP POST requests targeting the vulnerable application.
- The "group" parameter is exposed when navigating between organizational subgroups.
- The "status" parameter is used in various files when changing the status of entities (projects, tasks, users).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the application.
- No specific privileges within the application are explicitly mentioned as being required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Time Tracker versions prior to 1.19.33.5607.
- Patches were introduced in version 1.19.33.5607, with the introduction of functions `ttValidInteger` and `ttValidStatus` to properly validate the user input parameters.
- The advisory recommends upgrading to the patched version or, if that is not possible, manually implementing the input validation functions.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2021-43851 and is classified as having a "Moderate" severity.
