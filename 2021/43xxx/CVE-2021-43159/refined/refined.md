Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43159:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a command injection flaw within the `setSessionTime` function in the `/cgi-bin/luci/api/common` API endpoint of Ruijie RG-EW Series Routers. The vulnerability exists within the `common.lua` file specifically.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The `setSessionTime` function does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.
*   **Post-Authenticated RCE:** The vulnerability is exploitable only by an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can execute arbitrary commands on the router's underlying operating system. This can lead to complete compromise of the device.
*   **Device takeover:** Complete control of the device could allow attackers to change settings, intercept traffic, create a botnet, or use it to pivot to other devices in the same network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered through HTTP requests to the `/cgi-bin/luci/api/common` endpoint, specifically when interacting with the `setSessionTime` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be a legitimate, authenticated user on the web interface of the vulnerable router.

**Additional Notes:**

* The content mentions the vulnerability was found in Ruijie RG-EW Series Routers up to ReyeeOS 1.55.1915 / EW_3.0(1)B11P55.
* The vulnerability was discovered by Minh Khoa of VSEC.
* The vulnerability was tested on Ruijie RG-EW1200 and Ruijie RG-EW1200G PRO models.
