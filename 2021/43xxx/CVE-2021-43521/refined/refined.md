The provided content is related to CVE-2021-43521.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in the `zlog_conf_build_with_file` function within the zlog library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability occurs due to a read overflow when parsing a configuration file, which is followed by a potential write overflow due to incorrect bounds checking while processing the 'line' buffer. Specifically, the code reads a byte from the stack that underflows the "line" buffer. If this byte happens to be a space character ('0x20' or '0x90'), the code increments a pointer past the allocated buffer, which causes a stack buffer overflow upon writing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The stack buffer overflow can lead to a crash or other unexpected behavior, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite data on the stack. The original reporter also notes that a seemingly innocuous read overflow can lead to a write overflow due to how the `line` buffer is parsed.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted configuration file to the zlog library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to control the content of the zlog configuration file used by the application.
