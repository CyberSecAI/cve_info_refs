Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43440:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the iOrder 1.0 application. Specifically, the "Name" and "Phone number" fields within the signup form are vulnerable to injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not sanitize user inputs, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Name" and "Phone number" fields during user registration. This injected script is then stored in the application and executed when the user's profile is displayed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full User Compromise:** An attacker who successfully injects a malicious script can effectively compromise the user's account when that user views their profile. This allows the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim, potentially including:
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Redirecting the user to malicious sites.
    - Modifying content on the page.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Signup Form:** The primary attack vector is the signup form, where the attacker injects the malicious JavaScript code in the `Name` and `Phone number` fields.
- **Stored XSS:** The injected script persists in the application's database and is executed whenever the vulnerable fields are displayed to the user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to signup form:** The attacker needs to be able to access the registration page of the iOrder application.
- **Knowledge of XSS payload:** The attacker needs to be familiar with XSS techniques in order to craft a working payload.
