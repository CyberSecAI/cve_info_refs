Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43792:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Discourse handles tag group permissions and user notifications. Specifically, users who had previously set their notification preferences to "watch" or "track" tags, particularly staff-only tags, continued to receive notifications for those tags even after their staff status was revoked. This happened because the system did not properly check the user's current permissions when sending out tag notifications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inconsistent Permission Checks:** The application failed to consistently check user permissions before sending notifications related to tags.  While tag visibility was correctly restricted in the UI, the notification system lacked the same enforcement.
*   **Data Leakage:**  Users who were no longer authorized to view staff-only tags still received notifications about them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  The primary impact was the potential for information disclosure. Non-staff members could receive notifications about topics using staff-only tags, giving them information that was intended to be restricted to staff.
*  **Privacy concerns**: It is noted that some communities may not want specific information to be known outside of their staff team(s).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Action:**  The attack vector involves a legitimate user setting their tag notification preferences (e.g., watching/tracking) while having the necessary permissions, then having those permissions revoked (e.g. no longer staff), and still receiving notifications after the permission change.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Initial Access:** The "attacker" (in this case, a user who has lost staff status) must have had the ability to view the restricted tag at some point to set their notification settings.
*   **Change in Group Status:** The user's group status has to change (e.g. from staff to non-staff) for the vulnerability to be exposed

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The vulnerability affects users of tag groups who utilize the "Tags are visible only to the following groups" feature.
*   The issue is resolved in Discourse versions 2.7.11 and 2.8.0.beta9.
*   The fix ensures that users no longer receive notifications on tags they've watched before if they lack the required permissions.
*   The fix also removes these tags from their notification preferences.
*   The code changes associated with this fix can be found in the commit: `cdaf7f4bb3ec268238e4c29a14bb73fad56574b4` (and PR #15148). This includes changes to `app/models/tag_user.rb`, `app/services/post_alerter.rb`, and related spec files to ensure permission checks for notifications.
* The code changes ensure only users with tag group permissions can see and get notifications about the tags.
