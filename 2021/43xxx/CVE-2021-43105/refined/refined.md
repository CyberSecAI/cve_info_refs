{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2021-43105",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper validation when a conditional forwarder zone uses a forwarder controlled by an attacker or uses UDP/TCP forwarder protocol that the attacker can perform MiTM. This allows for cache poisoning.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper validation of responses from forwarders.",
        "Lack of sufficient security measures against man-in-the-middle attacks when using UDP/TCP forwarders."
      ],
      "impact": "The DNS cache can be poisoned, leading to users being directed to malicious websites or services instead of the intended ones.",
      "attack_vectors": [
         "Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks on UDP/TCP forwarder protocols."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker controlling a forwarder or able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack."
    }
