Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43807:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Opencast's failure to properly validate HTTP methods. It allows attackers to change the intended HTTP method of a request using a URL parameter (`_method`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- HTTP Method Spoofing: The application trusts the `_method` parameter in the URL, allowing a GET request to be interpreted as a PUT or DELETE request.
- Lack of Input Validation: The application does not validate or sanitize the HTTP method specified in the `_method` parameter.
- Potential for CSRF Bypass: By changing the method, the attacker can bypass CSRF protections normally associated with PUT or DELETE requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Server State Changes: Attackers can manipulate the server's state by crafting URLs or forms that modify data or resources intended to be accessed via different methods, such as creating new users (as exemplified).
- Privilege Escalation: The vulnerability could be used to perform actions that require different access privileges if the application relies solely on HTTP methods for authorization.
- CSRF attacks can be made more impactful since attackers can use GET requests to achieve state changing effects.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted URLs: The attacker can craft a malicious URL with the `_method` parameter to change the request type (e.g., `?_method=PUT`).
- Malicious Forms: Attackers can create a form that sends a GET request with the `_method` parameter, which will be processed as if it were a different method (e.g., `_method=DELETE`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need direct access to the server or have any user account to exploit the vulnerability itself.
- The attacker only needs to be able to convince a user (admin in the example) to click on a malicious URL or submit a malicious form.
- Knowledge of the application's API and endpoints is needed to create meaningful exploits.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Opencast versions prior to 9.10.
- Patched versions are 9.10 and 10.0.
- The vulnerability is classified as "High" severity.
- The fix includes an update of the CXF dependency to version 3.4.3.
