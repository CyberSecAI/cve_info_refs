# ReDos vulnerability on guest checkout email validation

High

[waiting-for-dev](/waiting-for-dev)
published
GHSA-qxmr-qxh6-2cc9
Dec 7, 2021

## Package

bundler

solidus\_core
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

< 3.1.4, < 3.0.4, < 2.11.13

## Patched versions

3.1.4, 3.0.4, 2.11.13

## Description

### Impact

Denial of service vulnerability that could be exploited during a guest checkout. The regular expression used to validate a guest order's email was subject to exponential backtracking through a fragment like `a.a.`.

Before the patch, it can be reproduced in the console like this:

```
irb(main)> Spree::EmailValidator::EMAIL_REGEXP.match "a@a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.@"
processing time: 54.293660s
=> nil
```

To reproduce in the browser, fill in the "Customer Email" field with that fake email address during a guest checkout. Before that, you should open the browser dev tools and change the `type` attribute for that field from `email` to `text`. After entering a fake address and pressing the "Save & Continue" button, the browser will take a long term to perform the request before showing an error message for the invalid address. Eventually, making the email string even longer could lead to the exhaustion of server resources.

### Patches

Versions 3.1.4, 3.0.4, and 2.11.13 have been patched to use a different regular expression.

There's an improbable chance that some orders in your system end up having associated an email address that is no longer valid. We've added a task to check precisely that:

```
bin/rails solidus:check_orders_with_invalid_email
```

The above will print information for every affected order if any.

### Workarounds

If a prompt upgrade is not an option, please, add the following to `config/application.rb`:

```
config.after_initialize do
  Spree::EmailValidator.send(:remove_const, :EMAIL_REGEXP)
  Spree::EmailValidator::EMAIL_REGEXP = URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP
end
```
