Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `downloadFlile.cgi` binary file is vulnerable to command injection due to improper handling of GET parameters. Specifically, the program uses the `QUERY_STRING` environment variable (which contains the GET request) without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to control the parameter names.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection. The vulnerability is in the `downloadFlile.cgi` program. The program doesn't sanitize the GET request parameters.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve unauthenticated command execution on the affected device.
*  **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/cgi-bin/downloadFlile.cgi` endpoint with malicious parameter names.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. No authentication is needed.
*   **Additional Details:**
    *   The vulnerable device is a ToTolink EX200 wireless extender.
    *   The affected firmware version is V4.0.3c.7646\_B20201211
    *   A proof-of-concept (POC) exploit is provided using `wget` to connect back to an attacker-controlled server.
    *  The vulnerability was found on 2021-10-20, and the vendor fixed it by 2021-11-03, however there was no public announcement by the vendor and the vulnerability was publicly disclosed on 2021-11-11.
