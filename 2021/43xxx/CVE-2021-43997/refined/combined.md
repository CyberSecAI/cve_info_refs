[`0437c82`](/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/commit/0437c8257aaeed4ecf0c50d2e1c7e8e48c4b799e)

Changes between FreeRTOS V10.4.3 LTS Patch 2 and FreeRTOS V10.4.3 LTS Patch 3 released September 16 2022

```
+ ARMv7-M and ARMv8-M MPU ports: It was possible for a third party that
  already independently gained the ability to execute injected code to
  read from or write to arbitrary addresses by passing a negative argument
  as the xIndex parameter to pvTaskGetThreadLocalStoragePointer() or
  vTaskSetThreadLocalStoragePointer respectively. A check has been added to
  ensure that passing a negative argument as the xIndex parameter does not
  cause arbitrary read or write.
  We thank Certibit Consulting, LLC for reporting this issue.
+ ARMv7-M and ARMv8-M MPU ports: It was possible for an unprivileged task
  to invoke any function with privilege by passing it as a parameter to
  MPU_xTaskCreate, MPU_xTaskCreateStatic, MPU_xTimerCreate,
  MPU_xTimerCreateStatic, or MPU_xTimerPendFunctionCall. MPU_xTaskCreate
  and MPU_xTaskCreateStatic have been updated to only allow creation of
  unprivileged tasks. MPU_xTimerCreate, MPU_xTimerCreateStatic and
  MPU_xTimerPendFunctionCall APIs have been removed.
  We thank Huazhong University of Science and Technology for reporting
  this issue.
+ ARMv7-M and ARMv8-M MPU ports: It was possible for a third party that
  already independently gained the ability to execute injected code to
  achieve further privilege escalation by branching directly inside a
  FreeRTOS MPU API wrapper function with a manually crafted stack frame.
  The local stack variable `xRunningPrivileged` has been removed so that
  a manually crafted stack frame cannot be used for privilege escalation
  by branching directly inside a FreeRTOS MPU API wrapper.
  We thank Certibit Consulting, LLC, Huazhong University of Science and
  Technology and the SecLab team at Northeastern University for reporting
  this issue.
+ ARMv7-M MPU ports: It was possible to configure overlapping memory
  protection unit (MPU) regions such that an unprivileged task could access
  privileged data. The kernel now uses highest numbered MPU regions for
  kernel protections to prevent such MPU configurations.
  We thank the SecLab team at Northeastern University for reporting this
  issue.

[`6f63da2`](/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/commit/6f63da20b3c9e1408e7c8007d3427b75878cbd64)

Changes between FreeRTOS V10.4.6 and FreeRTOS V10.5.0 released September 16 2022

```
+ ARMv7-M and ARMv8-M MPU ports: It was possible for a third party that
  already independently gained the ability to execute injected code to
  read from or write to arbitrary addresses by passing a negative argument
  as the xIndex parameter to pvTaskGetThreadLocalStoragePointer() or
  vTaskSetThreadLocalStoragePointer respectively. A check has been added to
  ensure that passing a negative argument as the xIndex parameter does not
  cause arbitrary read or write.
  We thank Certibit Consulting, LLC for reporting this issue.
+ ARMv7-M and ARMv8-M MPU ports: It was possible for an unprivileged task
  to invoke any function with privilege by passing it as a parameter to
  MPU_xTaskCreate, MPU_xTaskCreateStatic, MPU_xTimerCreate,
  MPU_xTimerCreateStatic, or MPU_xTimerPendFunctionCall. MPU_xTaskCreate
  and MPU_xTaskCreateStatic have been updated to only allow creation of
  unprivileged tasks. MPU_xTimerCreate, MPU_xTimerCreateStatic and
  MPU_xTimerPendFunctionCall APIs have been removed.
  We thank Huazhong University of Science and Technology for reporting
  this issue.
+ ARMv7-M and ARMv8-M MPU ports: It was possible for a third party that
  already independently gained the ability to execute injected code to
  achieve further privilege escalation by branching directly inside a
  FreeRTOS MPU API wrapper function with a manually crafted stack frame.
  The local stack variable `xRunningPrivileged` has been removed so that
  a manually crafted stack frame cannot be used for privilege escalation
  by branching directly inside a FreeRTOS MPU API wrapper.
  We thank Certibit Consulting, LLC, Huazhong University of Science and
  Technology and the SecLab team at Northeastern University for reporting
  this issue.
+ ARMv7-M MPU ports: It was possible to configure overlapping memory
  protection unit (MPU) regions such that an unprivileged task could access
  privileged data. The kernel now uses highest numbered MPU regions for
  kernel protections to prevent such MPU configurations.
  We thank the SecLab team at Northeastern University for reporting this
  issue.
+ Add support for ARM Cortex-M55.
+ Add support for ARM Cortex-M85. Contributed by @gbrtth.
+ Add vectored mode interrupt support to the RISC-V port.
+ Add support for RV32E extension (Embedded Profile) in RISC-V GCC port.
  Contributed by @Limoto.
+ Heap improvements:
  - Add a check to heap_2 to track if a memory block is allocated to
    the application or not. The MSB of the size field is used for this
    purpose. The same check already exists in heap_4 and heap_5. This
    check prevents double free errors.
  - Add a new flag configHEAP_CLEAR_MEMORY_ON_FREE to heap_2, heap_4
    and heap_5. If the flag is set in FreeRTOSConfig.h then memory freed using
    vPortFree() is automatically cleared to zero.
  - Add a new API pvPortCalloc to heap_2, heap_4 and heap_5 which has the same
    signature as the standard library calloc function.
  - Update the pointer types to portPOINTER_SIZE_TYPE. Contributed by
    @Octaviarius.
+ Add the ability to override send and receive completed callbacks for each
  instance of a stream buffer or message buffer. Earlier there could be
  one send and one receive callback for all instances of stream and message
  buffers. Having separate callbacks per instance allows different message
  and stream buffers to be used differently - for example, some for inter core
  communication and others for same core communication.
  The feature can be controlled by setting  the configuration option
  configUSE_SB_COMPLETED_CALLBACK in FreeRTOSConfig.h. When the option is set to 1,
  APIs xStreamBufferCreateWithCallback() or xStreamBufferCreateStaticWithCallback()
  (and likewise APIs for message buffer) can be used to create a stream buffer
  or message buffer instance with application provided callback overrides. When
  the option is set to 0, then the default callbacks as defined by
  sbSEND_COMPLETED() and sbRECEIVE_COMPLETED() macros are invoked. To maintain
  backwards compatibility, configUSE_SB_COMPLETED_CALLBACK defaults to 0. The
  functionality is currently not supported for MPU enabled ports.
+ Generalize the FreeRTOS's Thread Local Storage (TLS) support so that it
  is not tied to newlib and can be used with other c-runtime libraries also.
  The default behavior for newlib support is kept same for backward
  compatibility.
+ Add support to build and link FreeRTOS using CMake build system. Contributed
  by @yhsb2k.
+ Add support to generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for every release.
+ Add support for 16 MPU regions to the GCC Cortex-M33 ports.
+ Add ARM Cortex-M7 r0p0/r0p1 Errata 837070 workaround to ARM CM4 MPU ports.
  The application writer needs to define configENABLE_ERRATA_837070_WORKAROUND
  when using CM4 MPU ports on a Cortex-M7 r0p0/r0p1 core.
+ Add configSYSTICK_CLOCK_HZ to Cortex-M0 ports. This is needed to support
  the case when the SysTick timer is not clocked from the same source as the CPU.
+ Add hardware stack protection support to MicroBlazeV9 port. This ensures that
  the CPU immediately raises Stack Protection Violation exception as soon as any
  task violates its stack limits. Contributed by @uecasm.
+ Introduce the configUSE_MINI_LIST_ITEM configuration option. When this
  option is set to 1, ListItem_t and MiniLitItem_t remain separate types.
  However, when configUSE_MINI_LIST_ITEM == 0, MiniLitItem_t and ListItem_t
  are both typedefs of the same struct xLIST_ITEM. This addresses some issues
  observed when strict-aliasing and link time optimization are enabled.
  To maintain backwards compatibility, configUSE_MINI_LIST_ITEM defaults to 1.
+ Simplify prvInitialiseNewTask to memset newly allocated TCB structures
  to zero, and remove code that set individual structure members to zero.
+ Add prototype for prvPortYieldFromISR to the POSIX port so that it builds
  without any warning with -Wmissing-prototypes compiler option.
+ Add top of stack and end of stack to the task info report obtained using
  vTaskGetInfo(). Contributed by @shreyasbharath.
+ Add a cap to the cRxLock and cTxLock members of the queue data structure.
  These locks count the number items received and sent to the queue while
  the queue was locked. These are later used to unblock tasks waiting on
  the queue when the queue is unlocked. This PR caps the values of the
  cRxLock and cTxLock to the number of tasks in the system because we cannot
  unblock more tasks than there are in the system. Note that the same assert
  could still be triggered is the application creates more than 127 tasks.
+ Changed uxAutoReload parameter in timer functions to xAutoReload.  The
  type is now BaseType_t.  This matches the type of pdTRUE and pdFALSE.
  The new function xTimerGetAutoReload() provides the auto-reload state as
  a BaseType_t.  The legacy function uxTimerGetAutoReload is retained with the
  original UBaseType_t return value.
+ Fix support for user implementations of tickless idle that call
  vTaskStepTick() with xExpectedIdleTime ticks to step. The new code
  ensures xTickCount reaches xNextTaskUnblockTime inside xTaskIncrementTick()
  instead of inside vTaskStepTick(). This fixes the typical case where a task
  wakes up one tick late and a rare case assertion failure when xTickCount\
  rolls over. Contributed by @jefftenney.
+ Fix deadlock in event groups when pvPortMalloc and vPortFree functions
  are protected with a mutex. Contributed by @clemenskresser.
+ Fix a warning in tasks.c when compiled with -Wduplicated-branches
  GCC option. Contributed by @pierrenoel-bouteville-act.
+ Fix compilation error in tasks.c when configSUPPORT_DYNAMIC_ALLOCATION
  is set to zero. Contributed by @rdpoor.
+ Fix prvWriteMessageToBuffer() function in stream_buffer.c so that it correctly
  copies length on big endian platforms too.
+ Remove the need for  INCLUDE_vTaskSuspend to be set to 1
  when configUSE_TICKLESS_IDLE is enabled. Contributed by @pramithkv.
+ Update the RL78 IAR port to the latest version of IAR which uses the
  industry standard ELF format as opposed to earlier UBROF object format.
  Contributed by @felipe-iar.
+ Add tick type is atomic flag when tick count is 16-bit to PIC24 port. This
  allows the PIC24 family of 16 bit processors to read the tick count without
  a critical section when the tick count is also 16 bits.
+ Fix offset-out-of-range errors for GCC CM3/CM4 mpu ports when
  Link Time Optimization is enabled. Contributed by @niniemann.
+ Remove #error when RISC-V port is compiled on a 64-bit RISC-V platform.
  Contributed by @cmdrf.
+ Fix ullPortInterruptNesting alignment in Cortex-A53 port so that it is
  8-byte aligned. This fixes the unaligned access exception. Contributed
  by @Atomar25.
+ Fix  Interrupt Handler Register Function and Exception Process in NiosII
  Port. Contributed by @ghost.
+ Change FreeRTOS IRQ Handler for Cortex-A53 SRE port to store and restore
  interrupt acknowledge register. This ensures that the SRE port behavior
  matches the Memory Mapped IO port. Contributed by @sviaunxp.
+ Update the uncrustify config file to match the version of the uncrustify
  used in the CI Action. Also, pin the version of uncrustify in CI. Contributed
  by @swaldhoer.
