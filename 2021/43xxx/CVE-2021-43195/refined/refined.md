*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing HTTP security headers.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application was missing some HTTP security headers.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: The impact is not detailed in the bulletin. However, missing security headers can lead to various attacks such as clickjacking or cross-site scripting (XSS) through vulnerabilities in the application or by exploiting browser behavior when not given proper instruction by HTTP headers.
*   **Attack vectors**: An attacker could leverage the missing headers through other exploits in the application or by relying on insecure browser behaviors that the missing headers would otherwise prevent.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker could leverage the missing headers remotely after identifying the vulnerability and a way to exploit it.
