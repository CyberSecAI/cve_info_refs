# Client-Side JavaScript Prototype Pollution

Moderate

[rgrebenchuk](/rgrebenchuk)
published
GHSA-jx5q-g37m-h5hj
Jan 4, 2022

## Package

composer

oro/platform
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>=4.1.0, <4.1.14 || >=4.2.0

## Patched versions

4.2.8

## Description

### Summary

By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker could inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. Later this injection may lead to JS code execution by libraries that are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.

### Workarounds

Configure WAF to drop requests containing next strings: `__proto__` , `constructor[prototype]`, `constructor.prototype`

### Severity

Moderate

5.4

# CVSS overall score

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-43852

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
