- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in Trend Micro Security's Folder Shield feature allows files within protected folders to be modified without detection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Folder Shield feature, designed to prevent unauthorized modification of files in protected folders, fails to properly detect modifications.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to modify files in protected folders without being detected by Trend Micro Security. This could potentially lead to data corruption, malware injection, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system, with the privileges of a local user. The attacker does not need to interact with the user.
