The provided content is related to CVE-2021-43937.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web application does not sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request. This lack of verification makes the application susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to exposure of data or unintended code execution. The attacker could perform actions on behalf of a user without their knowledge or consent.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to trick a logged in user into sending a crafted request to the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user to perform unintended actions, usually by getting the user to click a malicious link or visit a malicious page. A low privileged user is needed for this attack.
