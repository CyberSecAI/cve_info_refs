- **Root cause of vulnerability:**
  - **CVE-2021-43551 (CWE-79):** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, leading to Cross-site Scripting (XSS).
  - **CVE-2021-43553 (CWE-863):** Incorrect authorization, allowing information disclosure to users with insufficient privileges.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - **CVE-2021-43551:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in PI Vision, specifically related to injecting code into a display.
  - **CVE-2021-43553:** Information disclosure vulnerability due to insufficient privilege checks for AF attribute limits.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - **CVE-2021-43551:**
    - Unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or deletion of PI System data and other data accessible by the victim's user permissions.
    - Successful exploitation requires user interaction with a malicious display using Microsoft Internet Explorer.
  - **CVE-2021-43553:**
    - Information disclosure of AF attribute data to unauthorized users.

- **Attack vectors:**
  - **CVE-2021-43551:** A remote attacker with write access to PI Vision could inject code into a display, which is triggered when a victim interacts with that display using Microsoft Internet Explorer.
  - **CVE-2021-43553:** A user with insufficient privileges can access information about an AF attribute that is the child of another attribute if it's configured as a Limits property.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - **CVE-2021-43551:** The attacker needs remote access and write privileges to PI Vision in order to inject the malicious code into a display. The victim must be using Microsoft Internet Explorer and interact with the display.
  - **CVE-2021-43553:** The attacker requires a user account with low privileges within PI Vision and knowledge of the affected AF attribute structure.
