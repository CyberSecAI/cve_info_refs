{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin uses an outdated method of transporting vehicles by deleting and recreating them instead of teleporting them.  This method is incompatible with Minecraft versions 1.12.2+, where deleting an entity causes its contents and passengers to drop instead of being removed.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of vehicle transport in Minecraft versions 1.12.2 and above.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Duplication of items in chests within minecarts, and duplication of passengers in vehicles.  In some cases, momentum issues can cause minecarts to enter a loop, further exacerbating the duplication.",
  "Attack vectors": "Teleporting minecarts with chests or vehicles with passengers through portals.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Any player on the server can exploit the vulnerability using the plugin's portal functionality. No special privileges are needed."
