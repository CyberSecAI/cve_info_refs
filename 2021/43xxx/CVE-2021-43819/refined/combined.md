# Product improperly handles vehicles when operating on MC 1.12.2+, causing data and passenger duplication.

## Package

maven

net.TheDgtl.Stargate.Portal
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

> 0.7.9.11

## Patched versions

> 0.11.5.1 (Unified Legacy Versions / Rewritten Versions); and 0.10.9.X, 0.9.5.X (Post 1.12 ESR Releases)

## Description

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49039536/142299500-9236b818-8723-494d-82ae-354b9e786952.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49039536/142299500-9236b818-8723-494d-82ae-354b9e786952.png)

## Scope:

* All versions of StarGate running code that is derivative of [Drakia's vehicle solution](https://github.com/TheDgtl/Stargate-Bukkit/blame/2b8f99c796141d3185b7b83057413b5dba94b472/src/net/TheDgtl/Stargate/Portal.java#L516-L536) on 1.12.2+ instances.
* As only versions above `0.7.9.11` are able to run on 1.12.2+, that is the earliest known version with this issue.
* This issue impacts the default configuration and can be exploited by all players.

## Method:

* Minecarts with chests will drop their items when teleporting through a portal; when they reappear, they will still have their items.
* This is likely a result of an antiquated transportation method, wherein the minecart is deleted and recreated instead of teleported.

## Analysis:

* The original method used for transporting vehicles was to delete their entity and recreate it at the intended destination.
  + Originally, when deleting an entity, its contents and passengers would be removed.
  + After MC 1.12.2, when deleted, an entity's contents and passengers *drop*.
* Momentum issues impact the minecart's behaviour; in some cases, they will re-enter portals into a loop.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
