Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The primary cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user input within the registration form. Specifically, the username field is not validated or sanitized correctly before being stored in the database or displayed in the login failure logs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious JavaScript code is injected into the system and stored in the database. This payload is later executed when an administrator views the login failure logs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cookie Stealing:** The immediate impact described is the potential to steal a user's cookies.
- **Unauthorized Access:** By obtaining user cookies, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to user accounts. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized actions, or further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Registration Form:** The attack vector is the registration form, specifically the username field. An attacker can input a malicious JavaScript payload into this field during the sign-up process.
- **Login Failure Logs:** The XSS payload is executed when an administrator views the logs of failed login attempts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker must be able to access the registration form.
-   The attacker must be able to create a user account using a crafted payload
-   No specific privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability; the XSS executes within the administrator's view of failed login logs.
