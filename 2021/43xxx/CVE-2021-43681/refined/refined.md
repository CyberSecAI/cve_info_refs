Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-43681:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `PostHandler.php` file of the SakuraPanel application, specifically how the application handles user input within the `checkRules` function and the subsequent output of error messages.
- The `checkRules` function does not sanitize the `proxy_name` parameter.
- The application directly prints the unsanitized `proxy_name` parameter from the POST request in an exit message via `$msg = $result[1] ?? "未知错误"; exit($msg);`, which leads to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The application directly outputs user-controlled data (`proxy_name`) into the HTML response without proper sanitization or encoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `proxy_name` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** The attacker could potentially steal cookies or session tokens, gaining unauthorized access to the user's account.
- **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts can be used to steal sensitive information from the victim's browser and send it to the attacker.
- **Website Defacement/Redirection:** The attacker might alter the appearance or redirect the user to a malicious website.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a malicious HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint, with the `proxy_name` parameter containing the XSS payload.
- **Reflected XSS:** The payload is reflected back to the user in the server's response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable SakuraPanel instance.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the correct URL and the method (POST) used to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details from the content:**

- The vulnerability is present in SakuraPanel version 1.0.1.1.
