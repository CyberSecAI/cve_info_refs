  "CVE-2021-43290": {
    "Description": "The content mentions a path traversal vulnerability in GoCD's artifact upload process, identified as CVE-2021-43290. This vulnerability is related to how artifact paths are crafted, and it allows writing files outside the intended artifact directory. This vulnerability can be chained with CVE-2021-43288 for exploitation.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of request parameters, specifically `stageCounter`, used in crafting the destination path for uploaded artifacts. While the `filePath` parameter is validated to prevent path traversal, `stageCounter` is not, allowing attackers to manipulate the final path.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal",
      "Insufficient Input Validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to write files with arbitrary content to arbitrary locations on the server. While direct code execution might not be immediately achievable, this can be chained with other vulnerabilities such as XSS to gain complete control.",
     "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted PUT request to the `/go/remoting/files/` endpoint with malicious values for the `stageCounter` parameter.",
    "Required capabilities": "Requires the attacker to have bypassed authentication and have agent privileges to upload the malicious artifacts. Additionally it can be exploited after an authenticated user visits the page containing the stored XSS payload (CVE-2021-43288) and takes other actions on behalf of the attacker"
