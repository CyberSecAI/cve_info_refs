{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user-supplied input in the `fieldS[]` and `orderby` parameters of the `/admin/export/getcsv` endpoint.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Blind SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could extract sensitive information from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries through vulnerable parameters. This includes potentially accessing user data, configurations, or other sensitive details stored in the database.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/admin/export/getcsv` endpoint, with the malicious SQL injected in `fieldS[]` or `orderby` parameters.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the admin panel. Also, the attacker needs to have knowledge of the application's structure and how it handles database queries."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided content also includes a proof of concept demonstration of the blind SQL injection using a `sleep()` function in the SQL query, illustrating how an attacker could test for successful injection through time-based responses. The issue was reported and acknowledged by the developer and was marked as resolved in the subsequent version of the software."
