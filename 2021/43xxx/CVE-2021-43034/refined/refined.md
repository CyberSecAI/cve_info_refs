The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in the Unitrends Backup appliance, but only two relate to the specified CVE. CVE-2021-43035 is an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability, while CVE-2021-43036 is related to a weak PostgreSQL account.

**CVE-2021-43035:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**  Unauthenticated SQL injection in the `/grid/config/config.php` script. The `host` parameter of the request is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Blind SQL injection. Input is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL statements.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution as the postgres user by creating a malicious user-defined function (UDF). This allows a complete compromise of the database and potentially the system.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/grid/config/config.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `host` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to the web management interface. No authentication is needed.

**CVE-2021-43036:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The presence of an undocumented, low-privileged PostgreSQL account named "wguest" with a weak password ("wguest").
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Weak credentials. The default password can be easily guessed or brute-forced.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** The 'wguest' account has limited privileges but can execute User Defined Functions (UDFs) and read certain tables. This can be leveraged for privilege escalation.
*   **Attack vectors:** Connecting to the PostgreSQL database with the "wguest" account.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to the PostgreSQL port.

The document also mentions other vulnerabilities such as:

*   **CVE-2021-43039:** SMB Null Sessions Allowed with Read/Write. This allows anonymous access to SMB shares on the appliance which, in this instance, didn't directly lead to any sensitive information disclosure, as the shares were mostly empty.
*   **CVE-2021-43038:** PostgreSQL Trigger Command Injection, Exploited through a vulnerable Perl trigger function that executes shell commands with unsanitized input.
*   **CVE-2021-43040:** Another unauthenticated blind SQL Injection vulnerability was discovered in the */cgi-bin/vaultServer* HTTP endpoint.

The content describes how these vulnerabilities can be chained together to achieve full system compromise, including remote code execution as root, however, these other issues are not related to the specified CVE.
