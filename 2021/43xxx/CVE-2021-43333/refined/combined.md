# Security Vulnerabilities

This page lists known security vulnerabilities with DXU.

### Known Issue: DXU service can accept unauthenticated settings changes[​](#known-issue-dxu-service-can-accept-unauthenticated-settings-changes "Direct link to Known Issue: DXU service can accept unauthenticated settings changes")

#### CVE: [CVE-2021-43333](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-43333)[​](#cve-cve-2021-43333 "Direct link to cve-cve-2021-43333")

#### Description[​](#description "Direct link to Description")

The DXU service, when enabled, exposes endpoints that can be used to change or query the configuration of the device. These endpoints require no authentication. This opens the possibility for malicious code to change device settings or gain information about the device.

No Wi-Fi passwords are exposed by this vulnerability.

Thanks to Cygenta Ltd. for finding this issue.

#### Mitigation[​](#mitigation "Direct link to Mitigation")

To avoid this security vulnerability, the DXU service must be disabled. This can be done on your device by performing the following steps:

1. Open DXU Agent.
2. Tap on the more icon in the lower right corner. This will cause a black bar pop-up.
3. Tap "Settings" on the black bar. This will bring up the settings menu.
4. Tap "Settings" in the menu. This will bring up general DXU agent settings.
5. Uncheck the "Enable service" checkbox.

On newer devices, such as the Skorpio X5, the service is off by default. On older devices, such as the DL-Axist, the service is on by default.

DL-AXIST ™

DATALOGIC RUGGED EXPERTISE MEETS
ANDROID™... IN A FULL TOUCH 5” PDA!
The DL-Axist™ PDA combines the latest
technologies and user friendly experience
in a complete package. An appealing look
and feel and a brilliant full touch 5 inch
HD screen are combined with industrial
robustness to survive indoor and outdoor
usage.  The DL-Axist PDA also has a
protective rubber boot and Gorilla® Glass
3 screen to ensure ruggedness.

DATA CAPTURE
The DL-Axist PDA is equipped with an
advanced 2D imager allowing quick and
easy data capture from high density
codes to the standard range distances,
along with Datalogic’s patented
‘Green Spot’ technology for good-read
feedback. For applications requiring
evidence of task execution or damaged
documentation, a 5 MP Autofocus
camera with a built-in LED flash provides
easy documentation with photos.

Datalogic’s SoftSpot™ technology is a
user-definable ‘floating soft trigger’ to
leverage the large touch display, allowing
a new triggering experience for the user!

WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
The DL-Axist PDA leverages five
embedded wireless technologies: Wi-Fi
802.11 a/b/g/n Cisco CCXv4 certified for
quick network access and with superior
MIMO technology (ensures higher
throughput and better coverage), 3G/4G
for real-time wide area voice and data
coverage, Enterprise Class Assisted GPS
(A-GPS) for location based applications,
Bluetooth® wireless technology v4 for
fast and low power consuming data
connections and NFC for easy and
intuitive configuration and pairing.

DATALOGIC ‘RUGGED MOBILITY’ WITH
ANDROID
The DL-Axist PDA integrates an Android
operating system (the leading OS for
mobile devices) complimented by a
suite of tools enabling Enterprise level
security, fast deployment and easy
management, thus helping to maximize
the users’ ROI.
