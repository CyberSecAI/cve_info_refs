- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Routinator processes RRDP repository chains without limiting their length.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Infinite loop due to unbounded chain processing.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Validation run never finishes, leading to Routinator continuing to serve old data or not serving any data.
- **Attack vectors:** Malicious CA creates a chain of CAs of infinite length using different RRDP repositories.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Malicious CA can create a chain of CAs using different RRDP repositories.
