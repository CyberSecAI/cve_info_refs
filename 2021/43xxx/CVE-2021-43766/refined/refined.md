**CVE-2021-23214**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the server processing unencrypted bytes during the initial connection phase when using `trust` authentication with a `clientcert` requirement or `cert` authentication. This occurs even when SSL certificate verification and encryption are enabled.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that during the initial connection establishment, the server is susceptible to processing unencrypted data, which can be exploited.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A man-in-the-middle attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attack during initial connection establishment.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be positioned as a man-in-the-middle during the initial connection between the client and the server.
