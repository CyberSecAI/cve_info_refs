Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-43576:

**Root Cause:**
The `pom2config` plugin for Jenkins does not properly configure its XML parser to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **XXE Vulnerability:** The plugin's XML parser is vulnerable to XXE attacks due to improper configuration. This allows external entities to be processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can leverage the vulnerability to extract secrets from the Jenkins controller.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Attackers can potentially perform SSRF attacks by making the Jenkins server access arbitrary URLs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted XML file that contains malicious external entity declarations.
- The crafted XML file is parsed by the vulnerable Jenkins plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers require Overall/Read and Item/Read permissions to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker does not need to be local, remote exploitation is possible.
