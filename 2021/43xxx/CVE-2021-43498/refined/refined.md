{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The password reset mechanism in `password_reminder.php` uses a predictable hash based on member ID, a timestamp, and the user's current password. This hash is used to generate a password reset link. If the attacker knows the member_id, time (in days since epoch), and has previously obtained a user's password hash, it is possible to predict the hash generated. The user's password hash may be leaked from other vulnerabilities, like SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Predictable password reset hash generation",
     "Insecure use of SHA1 for hashing (although not the primary issue)",
      "Lack of salt in hash"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can generate valid password reset links for arbitrary user accounts by obtaining the current user password hashes from the database and knowing the day of the request, then using this link to take over accounts.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack can be achieved by first obtaining a user's password from the database using an SQL injection vulnerability or other vulnerability leading to exposure of the password. With the member_id, and the knowledge of when the user requested a password reset (in days since epoch), and their password hash, the attacker can generate a valid reset link by calculating the same hash. The user then changes their password.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Ability to access a user's password hash from the database (e.g. through SQL injection)",
    "Knowledge of the target's member_id",
    "Ability to craft a malicious password reset link"
  ]
