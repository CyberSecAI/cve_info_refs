| Hi，there are SEVEN high-risk vulnerabilities in the Administrator background。please fix it as soon as possible。 Five Arbitrary file upload vulnerabilities。 In HelpManageAction.java、MembershipCardManageAction.java、QuestionManageAction.java、TopicManageAction.java、ForumManageAction.java，there are fllowing insecure code。  if(file.getContentType().equalsIgnoreCase("application/octet-stream")){ String fileType = FileType.getType(file.getInputStream()); for (String format :formatList) { if(format.equalsIgnoreCase(fileType)){ authentication = true; break; } } } And the getType funciton code is bellow。 public static String getType(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException { String fileHead = getFileContent(inputStream); if (fileHead == null || fileHead.length() == 0) { return null; }  ```     fileHead = fileHead.toUpperCase();         for (Map.Entry<String,String> entry : type.entrySet()) {     	if(fileHead.startsWith(entry.getKey())){     		return entry.getValue();     	}     }     return null;    }   ```  if Content-Type is “application/octet-stream” ，the program will go to getType function，and the function does not strictly check file suffixes。 proof of content。 Login to the administrator first,then chose the topic list and upload a file。with burpsuite ，you can change the Content-Type parameter to application/octet-stream，and change the filename to 1.jsp。 [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17904936/138825129-6ecbe4f4-3c0d-4647-b310-f5a4849dd91e.png) you can find the webshell upload successfully。 [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17904936/138825637-fa54b316-40c7-48c7-a6bc-79777b3ab1ec.png)  The other is Zip Slip Vulnerability. The problem lies in the system upgrade function. [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17904936/138827862-95600d99-e4a2-403b-b7cd-9ac6d87d74db.png) The vulnerability is exploited using a specially crafted archive that holds directory traversal filenames (e.g. ../../evil.sh). UpgradeNow funciton in UpgradeManageAction.java unzip the uploaded zip file without check filenames .  *ZipUtil.unZip(updatePackage\_path, temp\_path);*  ``` The hacker can exploit the website like this.  ```  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17904936/138829767-a3c3b85c-200c-471e-8004-9cd0cb2412ba.png)  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17904936/138829824-688dd8dd-b656-4028-a1ce-cd812c43e678.png)  ``` The third vulnerability  is code injection. Background management template.  ```  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17904936/138830128-03726e8b-bb86-4452-a721-542726031b50.png) you can edit the html file. so we can insert evil code as the html will be processed by freemarker engine. [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17904936/138830445-115ddc62-08f1-45dc-83d4-f68047f5e88f.png) when you access the website, the injected evil code will execute.
