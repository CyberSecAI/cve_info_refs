Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43778:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue in the `front/send.php` file of the GLPI barcode plugin. The plugin does not properly sanitize user-provided filenames, allowing an attacker to request files outside the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization on the filename parameter in `front/send.php`. This allows an attacker to manipulate the filename to access arbitrary files on the server.
- **Insecure File Handling:** The plugin fails to validate that requested files are within its designated directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** Attackers can read any file accessible by the web server user, potentially exposing sensitive information like configuration files, database credentials, or source code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP request to the `front/send.php` file, manipulating the filename parameter.
- Example: An attacker could use `../` sequences in the filename to traverse up directory levels and access files outside of the intended plugin directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable GLPI instance.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges within the GLPI application itself.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is located in the `front/send.php` file.
- The fix involves adding a security check in `front/send.php` to ensure that requested files are within the plugin's directory.
- The fix was implemented in commit `428c3d9adfb446e8492b1c2b7affb3d34072ff46` and was included in version 2.6.1 of the plugin.
- A workaround involves deleting the `front/send.php` file.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by hansmach1ne.
- The vulnerability affects version 2.0.0 of the barcode plugin.
