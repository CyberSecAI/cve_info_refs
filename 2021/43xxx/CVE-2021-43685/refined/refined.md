{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the `id` parameter when processing uploaded images, which leads to path manipulation within the `rename` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path manipulation vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of the showId parameter when constructing the file path for image upload, leading to arbitrary file move."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially move arbitrary files on the system by manipulating the `id` parameter in the image upload request.",
     "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered via a POST request to upload an image, where the `id` parameter is used to construct the destination path during the rename operation.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would require a valid login to upload an image and exploit the path manipulation vulnerability, as the rename occurs during image upload."
  }
