| Hello,  I would like to report for path manipulation vulnerability.  The path of the vulnerability.  In file <https://github.com/LibreTime/libretime/blob/master/legacy/application/modules/rest/controllers/ShowImageController.php>  line 319  ``` private function getShowId()     {         if (!($id = $this->_getParam('id', false))) {             //...         }         return $id;     } ```  line 52  ``` public function postAction() {         $showId = $this->getShowId();          //...          try {             $path = $this->processUploadedImage($showId, $_FILES['file']['tmp_name']);         } catch (Exception $e) {             // ...         } } ```  line 163  ``` private function processUploadedImage($showId, $tempFilePath) {         //...         $importedStorageDirectory = $storDir->getDirectory() .

| This vulnerability seem to be missing some description. Or am I missing something ?  Is it about moving arbitrary files from one place to another ?  I take a look next week. |

| Is it about moving arbitrary files from one place to another ?  It looks like it. My guess is that a correctly crafted `id` parameter can move arbitrary files around via the rename function. It can probably be mitigated by ensuring the provided `id` is an integer |

| I guess we have plenty of those while using the old zend framework. Until django takes over the software should not be considered as secure.  On my side, I am warning my users that the software is not safe. |

| So is this potentially exploitable by people without a login ? If so that would be a much bigger vulnerability vs. one that requires some level of authentication. |

| I don't think it is exploitable without a login - the rename occurs on image upload via POST |
