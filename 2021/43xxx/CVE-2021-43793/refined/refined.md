Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43793:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Discourse's poll feature handles voting limits, specifically for single-option polls. The system failed to properly enforce the restriction that a user could only cast one vote on such polls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient input validation:** The core issue was a lack of proper validation of the number of votes a user could cast in a single-option poll. Despite the intention to limit users to one vote, the system was not enforcing this constraint.
- **Logic Error:** The code logic allowed users to bypass the intended one-vote-per-user restriction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypassing vote limits:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cast multiple votes in a single-option poll.
- **Manipulation of poll results:** By casting multiple votes, a user could skew poll results, potentially leading to inaccurate or manipulated outcomes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct interaction with poll feature:** An attacker would interact with the poll feature directly through the user interface.
- **Repeated submission of votes:** The attacker would need to repeatedly submit votes for a single-option poll.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated user:** The attacker must be a registered user of the Discourse forum.
- **Access to poll:** The attacker needs access to a poll to cast votes.
- **No special privileges:** No elevated privileges or special access was required to perform the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content includes a commit ([1d0faed](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/1d0faedfbc3a8b77b971dc70d25e30791dbb6e0b)) that addresses the vulnerability. This commit introduces a SQL query that deletes older votes from a user once they have exceeded the allowed number of votes. It also adds validation for the min/max number of votes in the poll.
- The vulnerability was reported by JerryShah3 and ethicalbughunter.
- The fix was backported to the stable version of Discourse.
- The vulnerability was rated as "low severity."

In summary, CVE-2021-43793 is a vulnerability that allowed users to bypass voting limits in single-option polls on Discourse, leading to potential manipulation of poll results. The fix involved implementing proper validation and a mechanism for removing excess votes.
