- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of SAML responses.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software fails to properly validate responses received from a SAML identity provider.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user could assume the identity of another Guacamole user.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating SAML responses.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to manipulate SAML responses, which implies they must be on the network or a position where they can intercept the communication. SAML support must also be enabled in the vulnerable application (Apache Guacamole).
