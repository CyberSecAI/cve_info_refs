{
  "CVE-2021-43815": {
    "description": "Grafana versions 8.0.0-beta3 to 8.3.1 are vulnerable to a directory traversal flaw that allows authenticated users to read arbitrary .csv files when the TestData DB data source is enabled. The vulnerable URL path is /api/ds/query.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient path sanitization when handling requests to the `/api/ds/query` endpoint. The application fails to properly validate the requested filename, allowing an attacker to use directory traversal sequences to access arbitrary `.csv` files within the server's filesystem.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path traversal",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated user can read arbitrary `.csv` files on the server. This could lead to information disclosure of sensitive data if such files are stored on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Grafana instance and needs to send crafted HTTP requests with directory traversal sequences to the `/api/ds/query` endpoint. The TestData DB data source must also be enabled and configured in the instance, although this is not the default setting.",
    "cvss_score": 4.3
