Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described:

**Vulnerability 1: SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** The `p` parameter on the `/product.php` page does not sanitize user input before being used in an SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Un-authenticated error/boolean-based blind and error-based SQL injection vulnerability exists.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can extract sensitive data from the underlying MySQL database.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By manipulating the `p` GET parameter on the `/product.php` page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker can be unauthenticated and does not need any prior access to the system other than being able to make HTTP requests to the web application.

**Vulnerability 2: Arbitrary File Upload**

*   **Root Cause:** The `add_products` function only verifies the `Content-Type` header during file uploads, without proper checks on the file content.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Arbitrary file upload vulnerability, allowing an attacker to upload malicious files (e.g., a PHP shell).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could upload and execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By uploading a file with a modified `Content-Type` header through the `add_products` function.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to upload files through the web application. The content also implies that this upload functionality does not perform adequate checks to prevent uploading arbitrary file types.

**Additional Details**

*   The content provides specific examples of SQL injection payloads used by sqlmap, showcasing the various types of SQL injection vulnerabilities present (boolean-based, error-based, time-based, UNION query).
*   The content also provides an example of a successful file upload, showing the file path (`../product_images/1635249699_shell.php`) where the attacker uploaded a PHP shell.
