- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Automox Agent incorrectly sets permissions on a temporary directory while running in Windows environments.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure directory permissions on a temporary directory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A non-administrative user can read and write content to the Automox execution directory, which can then execute commands with elevated privileges. This leads to local privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs on Windows systems where the Automox agent is running. A non-administrative user can exploit the insecure permissions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have non-administrative access to the Windows machine where the vulnerable Automox agent is installed.
