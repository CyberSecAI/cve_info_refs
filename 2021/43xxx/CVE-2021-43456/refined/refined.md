Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-43456:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an unquoted service path in the `Rumble Mail Server` service. The service executable path is `C:\Program Files\Rumble\rumble_win32.exe --service`, which lacks quotes around the path with spaces.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unquoted Service Path: The service path for `RumbleService` is not enclosed in quotes, which allows for privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with elevated (LocalSystem) privileges during system startup or reboot.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access to the vulnerable system is required.
- By placing a malicious executable with a name of a folder in the service path before the actual executable, it will be executed by windows during the service startup. For example, creating folder "Program" at the root directory with an executable named "Files.exe". When windows tries to start the service, it will execute this malicious executable with elevated privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to write to the file system and create files/folders before the service startup.
- The attacker needs to have a non-admin user access in order to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes the output of `sc qc "RumbleService"` which confirms the unquoted path.
- The exploit information is specifically for `Rumble Mail Server 0.51.3135`.
- The Exploit-DB entry for this vulnerability is EDB-ID: 49203.

This information is more detailed than the typical CVE description which would just specify an unquoted service path vulnerability.
