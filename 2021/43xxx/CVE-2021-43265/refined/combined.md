### Bug Description

Hello again! In many places in Mahara it's possible to set "tags" for specific objects. In each case the input field used to edit tags is vulnerable to XSS. The attack pattern is to set the payload in a place where it's likely someone else will come and edit later on. Group pages seem like a good target as they seem likely to be edited as part as someone's normal workflow.

1. Visit <http://localhost:6142/mahara/group/edit.php> and create a group

2. Go to the "Pages and Collection" page in the group, click "+ Add" and select "Page" in the pop up selection

3. Write "<script>alert(document.domain)</script>" in the "Tags" input and click on the element that shows up in the "autocomplete" dropdown to set the tag (The XSS will pop but at this point it's only self XSS)

4. Save the page

5. Invite another user to your group to be your victim by going to the Members tab and clicking the "send multiple invitations at once" link

Now if the invited user edits that page's settings the XSS will fire.

There are other "tags" input through the application where a similar attack scenario would work.

Suggested CVSS: AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N 7.7

I'm taking a guess here with the A:H/I:H and I didn't push too hard to figure out the maximum impact, but the XSS should allow the attack to read and modify any private data that belongs to the victim.

Let me know if you need anything else!

Dominic

I'm not sure if adding the Mahara Security team as subscribers after the creation of the ticket was enough to get you folks notified so here's another message to generate a notification :)

This issue looks to be related to the screen-readable text we add to the selector after the tag is entered in relating to deleting the tag.

Have begun a patch for this problem

## Create portfolios

Using Mahara, students and staff create their personal learning stories by uploading evidence of activities they have participated in, and embedding publicly accessible content they have previously put online. They can write reflections on their experiences that frame this evidence, map it to competencies or registration requirements, and provide necessary context.

Mahara can be used for many different portfolio purposes, such as study, professional development, work-integrated learning, assessment, showcase and presentation, and employability.

## Share work

Mahara allows portfolios to be shared flexibly with one person, a specific group of people, or the entire world. Access can be further restricted to a particular time frame or just within an assessment task.

## Engage with others

Mahara makes it easy to comment and give feedback. Portfolios can also be submitted to learning management systems via LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) for marking.

Groups in Mahara allow people to create portfolios collaboratively and engage in forum discussions.
