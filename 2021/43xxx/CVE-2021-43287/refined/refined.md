{
  "CVE-2021-43287": {
    "Root cause": "A broken authentication mechanism in the Business Continuity add-on for GoCD, stemming from a change in the filter chain that allowed `/add-on/**` requests to bypass authentication, combined with a path traversal vulnerability.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Broken authentication, specifically the usage of `assumeAnonymousUserFilter` for `/add-on/**` requests.",
      "Path traversal vulnerability due to unsanitized user input in `pluginName` parameter",
	  "Arbitrary File Read vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "Unauthenticated attackers can leak highly sensitive information, including all encrypted secrets, API keys, and private source code repositories. Also, they can read arbitrary files on the GoCD server, potentially gaining access to sensitive credentials and database files. The vulnerability can also be used to impersonate a GoCD Agent.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending HTTP GET requests to `/add-on/business-continuity/plugin`, `/add-on/business-continuity/cruise_config`, and `/add-on/business-continuity/cipher.aes` endpoints, bypassing authentication.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No prior knowledge or authentication required; the vulnerability is exploitable remotely."
