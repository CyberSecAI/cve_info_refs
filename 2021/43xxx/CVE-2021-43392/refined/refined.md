The provided document is a security advisory from CERT-FR regarding vulnerabilities in STMicroelectronics products, specifically CVE-2021-43392 and CVE-2021-43393.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerabilities are present in the implementation of the ECDSA signature algorithm in STSAFE-J version 1.1.4 (in closed configuration) and J-SAFE3 version 1.2.5.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The vulnerabilities allow an attacker to obtain information about cryptographic secrets.
- The vulnerabilities allow an attacker to abuse the signature verification process under certain circumstances.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Loss of data integrity.
- Loss of data confidentiality.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerabilities are exploitable when signature verification is activated in STSAFE-J version 1.1.4 in closed configuration and J-SIGN products.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be in a position to interact with the affected products and trigger the vulnerable ECDSA signature verification process.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerabilities were discovered by ANSSI.
- The advisory explicitly mentions that J-SAFE3 EPASS BAC and EAC products are not affected.
- The advisory suggests that other products based on the Java Card J-SAFE-3 platform may potentially be impacted.
