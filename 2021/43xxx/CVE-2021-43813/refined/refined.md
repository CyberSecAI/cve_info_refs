Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43813:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly addresses CVE-2021-43813, describing a directory traversal vulnerability affecting Grafana. The content provides details such as affected versions, vulnerable paths, and mitigation strategies.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a directory traversal vulnerability in the Grafana API that allows access to local files through the `/api/plugins/.*/markdown/.*` URL path. This path does not properly sanitize input, allowing an attacker to access arbitrary files ending in `.md` within the server's file system, leading to information disclosure.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing attackers to traverse the file system by manipulating the URL path.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability can lead to disclosure of local files ending with the extension ".md".

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure**: Attackers can read arbitrary files ending with `.md` extensions present on the server.
*   **Limited Scope:** The impact is somewhat limited, as it only affects `.md` files and is limited to authenticated users.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exposed through the network via HTTP requests.
*   **URL Path Manipulation:** The attack vector involves manipulating the vulnerable URL path `/api/plugins/.*/markdown/.*` to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `..%2f`).

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** Attackers must be authenticated users of the Grafana instance.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers must have network access to the Grafana instance.

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered by using a vulnerable URL pattern that does not correctly sanitize the path, allowing access to arbitrary markdown files.
*   The vulnerability also allows access to files with extensions in either full upper case or full lower case (e.g., `/api/plugins/.*/markdown/FILE.MD`).
*   Attackers can use URL-encoded characters like `..%2f` to perform path traversal.
*   The vulnerability is rated as having a Moderate severity with a CVSS score of 4.3.

**Mitigation Strategies (from the content):**
*   **Upgrade:** The recommended mitigation is to upgrade to Grafana versions 8.3.2 or 7.5.12.
*   **Reverse Proxy:** Implement a reverse proxy that normalizes the PATH of the request, and ensures it handles url encoded paths.
*   **Block Vulnerable URL:** For `.md` files, block `/api/plugins/.*/markdown/.*` URL path using reverse proxy to prevent access.

This CVE affects Grafana versions 5.0.0 to 8.3.1 with the mentioned URL path. This vulnerability can be mitigated by updating Grafana versions and applying reverse proxy rules, in order to prevent path traversal exploits.
