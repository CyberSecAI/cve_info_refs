### Description

Methods of [`NSString`](https://docs.rs/fruity/0.2.0/fruity/foundation/struct.NSString.html) for conversion to a string may return a partial result.
Since they call [`CStr::from_ptr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ffi/struct.CStr.html#method.from_ptr) on a pointer to the string buffer, the
string is terminated at the first null byte, which might not be the end of the
string.

In addition to the vulnerable functions listed for this issue, the
implementations of [`Display`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Display.html), [`PartialEq`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialEq.html), [`PartialOrd`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html), and [`ToString`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/trait.ToString.html)
for [`NSString`](https://docs.rs/fruity/0.2.0/fruity/foundation/struct.NSString.html) are also affected, since they call those functions.

## Impact

Since [`NSString`](https://docs.rs/fruity/0.2.0/fruity/foundation/struct.NSString.html) is commonly used as the type for paths by the [Foundation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation)
framework, null byte truncation might allow for easily bypassing file extension
checks. For example, if a file name is provided by a user and validated to have
one of a specific set of extensions, with validation taking place before
truncation, an attacker can add an accepted extension after a null byte (e.g.,
`file.exe\0.txt`). After truncation, the file name used by the application
would be `file.exe`.

It would be better to generate unique names for files, instead of using
user-provided names, but not all applications take this approach.

## Example:

```
let string = NSString::from_str("null\0byte");
println!("{}", string);

```

That example only prints the string "null".

| This issue was originally reported privately, but I thought I should create an issue to inform others about it, as it has not yet been fixed.  The implementation of [`Display`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Display.html) for [`NSString`](https://docs.rs/fruity/0.2.0/fruity/foundation/struct.NSString.html) truncates at null bytes, since it uses [`CStr::from_ptr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ffi/struct.CStr.html#method.from_ptr). It should be possible to use [`[NSString lengthOfBytesUsingEncoding:]`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsstring/1410710-lengthofbytesusingencoding) and [`[NSString UTF8String]`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsstring/1411189-utf8string) instead to create the complete string.  Example:  ``` let string = NSString::from_str("null\0bytes"); println!("{}", string); ```  That example only prints the string "null". Since [`ToString::to_string`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/trait.ToString.html#tymethod.to_string) uses [`Display`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Display.html) to create strings, it has the same issue. [`NSString::to_str`](https://docs.rs/fruity/0.2.0/fruity/foundation/struct.NSString.html#method.to_str) and [`NSString::to_str_with_null`](https://docs.rs/fruity/0.2.0/fruity/foundation/struct.NSString.html#method.to_str_with_nul) also have the same issue.  If you believe this is a valid issue, I encourage you to file a security advisory at <https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db>, including a patch version if it is possible to release within two weeks.  Thank you for your work on this crate. Creating a security advisory is not meant to be anything other than a way to provide information to other users. |

| Thanks [@nvzqz](https://github.com/nvzqz)! The new implementation looks good and appears to resolve the issue. Also, [`NSString::from_str_no_copy`](https://docs.rs/fruity/0.3.0/fruity/foundation/struct.NSString.html#method.from_str_no_copy) should no longer need a "Safety" section, since it's safe now. |

| [@dylni](https://github.com/dylni) that method is safe because the `NSString` cannot outlive the input due to the `'data` lifetime. I forgot to remove the safety notice. |

If the user needs the string to end with e.g. two NUL, we really shouldn't stop them.

`fruity` probably did this originally because their NSString truncated at null bytes, see [nvzqz/fruity#14](https://github.com/nvzqz/fruity/issues/14)

Issue: [nvzqz/fruity#14](https://github.com/nvzqz/fruity/issues/14)

A CVE request has been submitted as well.

Questions:

* Can I add trait implementations to the `functions` list?
* Should I create an unmaintained crate advisory too?

| Thank you for the report!  Could you clarify why this presents a security issue, ideally in the advisory text? It does appear to be a logic bug, but I don't see any evidence of memory corruption or the like. |

| [@Shnatsel](https://github.com/Shnatsel) An impact section has now been added. Does it seem sufficient?  This is easily one of the less severe security issues in many cases, since there are usually other mitigations that would prevent it. However, it was one of the main criticisms of PHP, for instance, so it has caused issues for filename validation in the past: <https://www.php.net/manual/en/security.filesystem.nullbytes.php> |

| Thanks [@Shnatsel](https://github.com/Shnatsel)!  Should I create an issue to ask if the crate is no longer maintained, or is [nvzqz/fruity#13](https://github.com/nvzqz/fruity/issues/13) sufficient?  Also, the `affected.functions` section does not include the affected traits (e.g., `Display`). Is there a way to include those as well? |
