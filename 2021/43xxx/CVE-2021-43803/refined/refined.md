{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from a lack of proper error handling when parsing URLs in the `next-server` component. Specifically, if a provided URL cannot be parsed, an `unhandledPromiseRejection` occurs which, in Node.js versions greater than v15.0.0, terminates the server process, leading to a crash.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unhandled Promise Rejection: The application fails to handle the promise rejection that occurs when a URL cannot be parsed, particularly when using Node.js v15.0.0 or greater.",
     "Lack of Input Validation: The server does not properly validate or sanitize URLs, leading to the possibility of processing malformed URLs that can trigger the vulnerability."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause an unexpected server crash by sending a malformed URL to a Next.js application. The crash could cause a denial of service by terminating the server process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through sending an invalid or malformed URL to the Next.js server via HTTP request. The server attempts to parse the URL and fails, triggering the unhandled promise rejection and causing server termination.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Next.js server. No specific capabilities are required beyond making web requests with an invalid URL."
