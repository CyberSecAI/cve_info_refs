- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `tcpip.sys` driver where user-supplied data length isn't properly validated before being copied into a fixed-length heap-based buffer, causing a heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow due to missing input validation of data length.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker must first gain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
