  "CVE-2021-43138": {
    "description": "The vulnerability is due to a prototype pollution issue in the `mapValues` function. By providing an object with a `__proto__` key, an attacker can inject or modify properties on the Object prototype. This can lead to unexpected behavior or code execution when the properties are accessed. The issue affects versions of async before 3.2.2 and before 2.6.4.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "before 3.2.2",
      "before 2.6.4"
    ],
    "fixed_versions": [
      "3.2.2",
      "2.6.4"
    ],
     "root_cause": "The `createObjectIterator` function did not properly handle the `__proto__` key during object iteration, causing it to pollute the prototype if an object with the `__proto__` key was passed to the `mapValues` function.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Prototype Pollution"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can modify or inject properties on the Object prototype, potentially leading to code execution or denial of service",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited by supplying a crafted object with a `__proto__` key to the `mapValues` function of the async library."
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to control the input object passed to `async.mapValues` or `async.mapValuesLimit` function."
