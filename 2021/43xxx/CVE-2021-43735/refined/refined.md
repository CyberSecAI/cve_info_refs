The provided content details a SQL injection (SQLi) vulnerability in Cmswing version 1.3.7.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `condition` parameter within the `update_channel` module is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: Malicious SQL code can be injected via the `condition` parameter.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The application doesn't sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- Data Breach: Sensitive data could be accessed, modified, or deleted.
- System Compromise: In some cases, the attacker could gain unauthorized access to the server or underlying operating system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs access to the system's backend with the ability to edit `update_channel` module, and navigation settings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated access to the application's administration panel.
- Ability to edit `update_channel` module configuration.
- Ability to change navigation settings.

**Technical details:**
1. The attacker navigates to the `update_channel` module and edits it.
2. The attacker changes behavior rule to `table:member|field:score|condition:id=${self} AND (select if(substr(version(),1)>0,sleep(5),1))|rule:1`. This injects SQL code into the `condition` parameter.
3. The attacker goes to system settings and changes navigation settings.
4. When the changes are saved, the injected SQL code is executed which leads to the vulnerability. The `sleep(5)` function confirms that the injection worked.
