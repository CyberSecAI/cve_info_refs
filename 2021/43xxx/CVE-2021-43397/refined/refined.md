      "cve": "CVE-2021-43397",
      "root_cause": "The LiquidFiles API allows a 'User Admin' to list all registered users, including System Administrators, and retrieve their API keys. The API keys are then used for HTTP basic authentication.",

        "Privilege Escalation",
         "Insecure API access control",
         "Exposure of sensitive information (API keys)"
