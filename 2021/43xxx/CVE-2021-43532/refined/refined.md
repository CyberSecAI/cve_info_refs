Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43532:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the "Copy Image Link" context menu action in Firefox copying the final image URL after redirects, instead of the initial URL before redirects. This behavior could be abused in conjunction with Content Security Policy (CSP) to intercept the redirection at a specific point and leak sensitive authentication tokens present in the intermediate redirect URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The "Copy Image Link" action reveals the final URL after redirects, potentially exposing sensitive information (e.g., authentication tokens) present in intermediate redirect URLs.
*   **CSP Bypass (Partial):** By using a CSP directive to block the final redirect, the attacker can force the "Copy Image Link" to expose the desired intermediate URL containing sensitive data.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction: right-clicking an image, selecting "Copy Image Link", and then pasting the link back into the attacker's webpage. However, social engineering tactics can make this more plausible.
*   **Inconsistent URL Handling**: Firefox's "Copy Image Link" context menu action behaved differently from other similar browser features, such as image drag and drop, and also different from Chrome, leading to confusion and unexpected behaviour.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** By obtaining authentication tokens from intermediate redirect URLs, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the user's accounts on various services (e.g. Google).
*   **Data Leakage:** Exposing sensitive data contained in URLs, such as session IDs, API keys, and other authentication credentials.
*   **Phishing:** A malicious site could manipulate users by displaying one image while linking to another containing authentication tokens or other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** The attacker hosts a website that embeds a specially crafted image. This image will trigger a redirect chain containing sensitive information in one of the intermediate redirects.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the user into right-clicking the image, selecting "Copy Image Link", and then pasting the copied link back onto the malicious site. The provided PoCs demonstrate scenarios where a user might be tricked into this, such as a "search by image" functionality on a site controlled by the attacker.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** The attack leverages CSP to interrupt the redirect chain at a specific point and force the browser to retain the desired intermediate URL that contains sensitive authentication information.
*   **Redirect Chaining:** The attacker crafts a redirect chain where the intermediate URLs contain the sensitive data they wish to obtain.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host a Website:** The attacker needs a platform to host their malicious webpage.
*   **Knowledge of Redirection Chains:** The attacker needs an understanding of how to create a redirect chain with sensitive data in intermediate steps.
*   **Some Social Engineering Skill:** The attacker needs to convince the user to interact with the malicious website and copy/paste the image link.
*   **Understanding of CSP:** The attacker needs an understanding of how to use CSP to manipulate the redirect chain.

**Additional details from the bugzilla entries:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Ademar Nowasky Junior.
*   The fix involved changing the "Copy Image Link" action to return the original URL of the image instead of the final URL after all redirects.
*   The bug was fixed in Firefox 94 and was not uplifted to ESR versions due to low impact and user interaction requirement.
*   There was extensive discussion about the pros and cons of using the pre-redirect URL vs the post-redirect URL, including how this behavior differs from Chrome and impacts web extensions.
*   The discussion also highlighted that while the attack required user interaction, the potential for account takeover made it a worthwhile fix.

The information provided in the bugzilla entries adds much more context and technical detail than a standard CVE description, clarifying the nuances of the exploit and the reasoning behind the fix.
