Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2021-43842:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of SVG files uploaded to Wiki.js. A crafted SVG file can contain malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Malicious SVG files, when viewed directly by other users, can execute embedded JavaScript code.
*   **Lack of SVG Sanitization:** The application did not sanitize SVG uploads, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    *   Data theft (e.g., cookies, session tokens)
    *   Account hijacking
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Defacement of the Wiki

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SVG File Upload:** The attacker uploads a specially crafted SVG file to the Wiki.
*   **Direct SVG View:** The vulnerability is triggered when other users view the malicious SVG file directly (not when loaded as an `<img>` tag).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Wiki.js User Account:** The attacker needs a user account on the Wiki.js instance.
*   **File Upload Capability:** The attacker needs permission to upload files to the Wiki.js instance.
*   **Knowledge of SVG Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious SVG file containing XSS payloads.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.5.258 of Wiki.js.
*   The fix involves adding an optional (enabled by default) SVG sanitization step to all file uploads that match the SVG mime type.
*   A workaround is to disable file upload for all non-trusted users.
*   The vulnerability was reported by WhiteSource.
