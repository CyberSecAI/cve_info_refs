The code had a flaw that allowed a crafted message to trigger a panic, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious node could send a specially crafted message, causing all orderers to crash and leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
A malicious node sends a crafted message through the `chain.rpc.SendSubmit` interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be a malicious node within the Hyperledger Fabric network and have the ability to send messages through the `chain.rpc.SendSubmit` interface.
