Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43577:

**CVE-2021-43577**

*   **Root Cause:** The OWASP Dependency-Check Plugin does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
*   **Vulnerability:**  The plugin is vulnerable to XXE injection due to improper configuration of the XML parser.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract secrets from the Jenkins controller or perform server-side request forgery (SSRF).
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker who can control the contents of the Jenkins workspace can provide a specially crafted XML file to be parsed by the plugin.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to control workspace contents (which implies having job execution rights or the ability to upload crafted files to the workspace). They require  `Item/Read` permission.
*   **Affected Versions:** OWASP Dependency-Check Plugin 5.1.1 and earlier.
*   **Fix:** As of the publication of this advisory, no fix is available.

**Summary of Key Information:**
The core issue is that the OWASP Dependency-Check Plugin uses an XML parser without disabling external entity processing. This allows a malicious actor who can control the content of a file processed by the plugin to perform XXE attacks, leading to potential information disclosure or server-side request forgery.
