{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The execution time of the `MakePublicKey` function in Crypto++ is not constant and is correlated with the length of the private key. This timing difference allows an attacker to potentially infer the length of the private key.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Timing Leakage",
       "Information Disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who can measure the execution time of the `MakePublicKey` function can infer the length of the private key, which could provide information that facilitates malicious attacks on key decryption. Although the direct impact is limited, it is a potential vulnerability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Timing Attack"
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to measure the time taken by the `MakePublicKey` function. They do not need to possess the private key itself, but they need the ability to execute the vulnerable code and measure its execution time. This often requires network level or local access to the victim's application.",
    "additional_details": "The issue is specific to the `MakePublicKey` function within the Crypto++ library, and the vulnerability is a timing side-channel rather than a direct code execution flaw. OpenSSL was also tested, and their implementation is designed to avoid this issue, resulting in more consistent execution time regardless of private key length. The maintainers of Crypto++ initially considered this not a bug, but the issue was raised to MITRE to have the CVE disputed. The vulnerability is present in Crypto++ versions 8.6.0 and earlier. It is noted as a 'bogus' CVE by the project maintainers as the underlying issue is deemed not exploitable."
