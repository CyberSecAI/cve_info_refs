{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The commit message indicates a fix for 'Signature r and s range check'. This suggests that the vulnerability was likely a lack of proper validation for the 'r' and 's' values in ECDSA signatures.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Cryptographic Weakness"
    ],
    "impact": "Without proper range checks, it may be possible to craft ECDSA signatures with invalid 'r' or 's' values. The impact of such an attack is not clear from the provided information, but could lead to signature forgery or other cryptographic vulnerabilities.",
    "attack_vectors": "Crafting specific inputs with invalid r and s values. Exploiting the lack of proper range checks. Attack would be against systems that utilize or process the ECDSA signatures generated or verified by the vulnerable code.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to have the ability to generate or modify ECDSA signatures, possibly requiring access to an application or API that utilizes the affected library."
