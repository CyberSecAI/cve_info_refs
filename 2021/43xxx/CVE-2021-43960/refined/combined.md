## Hear from our customers **Testimonials** and **case studies**

 We’re glad Lorensbergs is such a reliable supplier. We would certainly recommend Netloan to other libraries… It’s straightforward and makes life so much easier.
## Kent Libraries

###

![](https://www.lorensbergs.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/kent-library.jpg)

 Netloan does a lot. We started from the point of ‘this is what we’d like it to do, can it do it? Netloan did exactly what we wanted it to do… The Lorensbergs support team also come highly recommended. It’s been a very good experience all round.
## North Tyneside Libraries

###

![](https://www.lorensbergs.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/north-tyneside.jpg)

 Netloan is, as ever a reliable system. It is probably the most reliable of all our systems; certainly the one that gives me the least headaches anyway.
## Perth and Kinross Libraries

###

![](https://www.lorensbergs.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/perth.jpg)

 It’s a relationship that we are 100% positive about – how Lorensbergs have developed the product and also the way in which we’ve been supported throughout the central library project. Working with Lorensbergs is a partnership where both parties strive for the same thing, which is to offer a top quality service
## Manchester City Council

###

 The value of having Netloan Wi-Fi print by far outweighs the cost of providing it. It’s about supporting good access to an important facility – library printing. Our staff are completely behind it, and use has risen very quickly.
## Neath Port Talbot Libraries

###

![](https://www.lorensbergs.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/neath-port.jpg)

 Working with Lorensbergs as we changed PC booking system was brilliant. It’s been a very good relationship, very professional and always a quick response to any questions or service calls.

## Slough Libraries Case Study: Wi-Fi printing with Netloan

## Library Self-Service: Kiosk integration and support

 There are many benefits of self-service kiosks, but arguably the greatest comes from freeing staff to have higher value interactions with their customers. In fact you could say that library self-service goes hand in hand with developing progressive services. Many head to the library for valued advice from the professionals they trust, whether on digital inclusion, literacy, health information or an array of other topics. Self-service improves staff availability for providing this support, while giving a convenient, modern experience for those who simply wish to print a document or return a book.

## Cardiff Chapel Restoration: New library offers new opportunities

 A new library has opened at the restored former Cardiff Royal Infirmary (CRI) chapel. Following its official opening, Lorensbergs talked to James Gorwill, Digital Officer, and Helen Cleal, Senior Hub Officer at Cardiff Libraries, to hear more about this exciting new project.
The former chapel, named Capel I Bawb, has been sensitively restored to offer modern facilities in an historic, listed building. The rooms are suspended within the structure so that the shape and original characteristics of the chapel are still experienced. The result is one of historic architecture neatly encasing a 21st century modern service. Customers browse books and rest on the original ornate wooden pews to read, use their devices or simply enjoy the setting. Light spills through the beautiful stained-glass windows into the library’s IT suite, where computer users access the latest technology…

2025 is an important year of collaboration for libraries and their IT teams. Not least, Windows 10 support ends this October: for many authorities, the need to change operating system will involve extensive PC refresh projects across their library sites.
