| Hello,  I would like to report to XSS vulnerability.  The path.  In file src/Client.php line 30  ``` while(false !== $receiveResult = socket_read($socket, 2048, PHP_NORMAL_READ)) { 	$receiveContent .= $receiveResult; 	// ... 	$data = $this->parser->receive($receiveContent); 	// ... } ```  In file src/ClientParser.php line 24  ``` public function receive($data) {   $data = $this->parseData($data);   switch($data['a'])   { 	  // ... 	  case ServerAction::INIT_RESPONSE: 		  $this->worker->initResponse($data['data']); 		  break;   } }  public function parseData($data) {   return json_decode(substr($data, 0, -2), true); } ```  In file src/ClientWorker.php line 98  ``` public function initResponse($data) {   if(!$data['success'])   { 	  exit('Error: ' . $data['message']);   } } ```  Exit function will terminate the script and print a message which have values from the socket\_read. Which will lead to XSS vulnerability. |
