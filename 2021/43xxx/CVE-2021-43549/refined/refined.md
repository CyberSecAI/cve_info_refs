Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of input during web page generation, specifically a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The PI Web API does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information of users who interact with a crafted link.
*   **False Information Delivery:** Attackers could deliver false or misleading information to users by redirecting them to a malicious website.
*   **Redirection to Malicious Website**: Attackers can redirect users to a malicious website after they interact with a PI Web API endpoint

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   **Authenticated Attack:** The attacker must have write access to a PI Server to exploit this.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim must interact with a maliciously crafted PI Web API endpoint link or be redirected to a malicious website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote.
*   **Authenticated User:** Requires an attacker to have write access to a PI Server.
*  **Social Engineering**: The attacker needs to trick the victim to interact with the malicious link.

**Additional Information:**
*   The affected product is OSIsoft PI Web API, specifically all versions of PI Web API 2019 SPI and prior.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.9 with the vector string (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N).
