      "root_cause": "The `bundler` gem was vulnerable to argument injection when handling git URLs. Git commands were being constructed using user input from the Gemfile, specifically the repository URL. When building the commands, `bundler` correctly avoids Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, a user input starting with a dash ('-') would be treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This could lead to code execution because some Git commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables.",

      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to takeover of the system.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker crafts a directory containing a Gemfile with a malicious git URL starting with a dash (e.g., `-u./payload`). The victim runs a bundler command like `bundle lock` which evaluates the Gemfile.",
         "An attacker could also trick a developer into using a malicious gem from a git repository via social engineering."

      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious `Gemfile` with a crafted git URL and trick a victim into running bundler commands in the same directory."
