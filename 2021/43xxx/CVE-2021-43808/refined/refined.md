{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Blade templating engine was vulnerable to XSS due to predictable parent placeholder SHA-1 hashes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Predictable hash generation for parent placeholders in Blade templates."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code via a crafted value in the view, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing a specially crafted value that includes a predictable parent placeholder hash, an attacker can inject malicious HTML and JavaScript.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the data that is passed to the Blade template. They also need to be able to guess the parent placeholder SHA-1 hash by trying common names of sections."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The vulnerability was addressed by generating a random hash unique to each request for the parent placeholder, as opposed to relying on a SHA1 of the section name."
