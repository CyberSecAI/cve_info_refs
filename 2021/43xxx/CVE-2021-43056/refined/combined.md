  To: oss-security; +Cc: linuxppc-dev

The Linux kernel for powerpc since v5.2 has a bug which allows a
malicious KVM guest to crash the host, when the host is running on
Power8.

Only machines using Linux as the hypervisor, aka. KVM, powernv or bare
metal, are affected by the bug. Machines running PowerVM are not
affected.

The bug was introduced in:

    10d91611f426 ("powerpc/64s: Reimplement book3s idle code in C")

Which was first released in v5.2.

The upstream fix is:

  cdeb5d7d890e ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Make idle_kvm_start_guest() return 0 if it went to guest")
  <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=cdeb5d7d890e14f3b70e8087e745c4a6a7d9f337>

Which will be included in the v5.16 release.

Note to backporters, the following commits are required:

  73287caa9210ded6066833195f4335f7f688a46b
  ("powerpc64/idle: Fix SP offsets when saving GPRs")

  9b4416c5095c20e110c82ae602c254099b83b72f
  ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix stack handling in idle_kvm_start_guest()")

  cdeb5d7d890e14f3b70e8087e745c4a6a7d9f337
  ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Make idle_kvm_start_guest() return 0 if it went to guest")

  496c5fe25c377ddb7815c4ce8ecfb676f051e9b6
  ("powerpc/idle: Don't corrupt back chain when going idle")

I have a test case to trigger the bug, which I can share privately with
anyone who would like to test the fix.

cheers

I have tested these patches against 5.14 but it seems the problem [1] still remains for me
for big-endian guests. I built a patched kernel yesterday, rebooted the KVM server and let
the build daemons do their work over night.

When I got up this morning, I noticed the machine was down, so I checked the serial console
via IPMI and saw the same messages again as reported in [1]:

It seems that in this case, it was the testsuite of the git package [2] that triggered the bug. As you
can see from the overview, the git package has been in the building state for 8 hours meaning the
build server crashed and is no longer giving feedback to the database.

I don't suppose you were able to get any more of the log saved? (The
first error messages that happened might be interesting)

Thanks,

OK, that sucks.

I did test the repro case you gave me before (in the bugzilla), which
was building glibc, that passes for me with a patched host.

I guess we have yet another bug.

I tried the following in a debian BE VM and it completed fine:

 $ dget -u <http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/g/git/git_2.33.1-1.dsc>
 $ sbuild -d sid --arch=powerpc --no-arch-all git_2.33.1-1.dsc

Same for ppc64.

And I also tried both at once, repeatedly in a loop.

I guess it's something more complicated.

What exact host/guest kernel versions and configs are you running?

cheers

Did you manage to crash the unpatched host? If the unpatched host crashes
for you but the patched doesn't, I will make sure I didn't accidentally
miss anything.

Also, I'll try a kernel from git with Debian's config.

Did you try building gcc-11 for powerpc and ppc64 both at once?

Both the host and guest are running Debian's stock 5.14.12 kernel. The host has
a kernel with your patches applied, the guest doesn't.

Let me do some more testing.

Yes, the parallel builds of glibc you described crashed the unpatched
host 100% reliably for me.

I also have a standalone reproducer I'll send you.

OK that sounds fine.

I tested upstream stable v5.14.13 + my patches, but there's nothing
betwen 5.14.12 and 5.14.13 that should matter AFAICS.

Thanks.

That completed fine on my BE VM here.

I ran these in two tmux windows:
  $ sbuild -d sid --arch=powerpc --no-arch-all gcc-11_11.2.0-10.dsc
  $ sbuild -d sid --arch=ppc64 --no-arch-all gcc-11_11.2.0-10.dsc

The VM has 32 CPUs, with 4 threads per core:

  $ ppc64_cpu --info
  Core   0:    0*    1*    2*    3*
  Core   1:    4*    5*    6*    7*
  Core   2:    8*    9*   10*   11*
  Core   3:   12*   13*   14*   15*
  Core   4:   16*   17*   18*   19*
  Core   5:   20*   21*   22*   23*
  Core   6:   24*   25*   26*   27*

It seems I also can no longer reproduce the issue, even when building the most problematic
packages and I think we should consider it fixed for now. I will keep monitoring the server,
of course, and will let you know in case the problem shows again.

Thanks a lot again for fixing this issue!

Adrian

Hello!

An update to this post with oss-security CC'ed.

I have done thorough testing and I'm no longer seeing the problem with the patched kernel.

I am not sure what triggered my previous crash but I don't think it's related to this
particular bug. I will keep monitoring the server in any case and open a new bug report
in case I'm running into similar issues.

Thanks,
Adrian

This is very unfortunate, but just after I sent this mail, the machine crashed again.

Sorry for the premature success report. I will have to check now what happened
and get in touch with Michael.

The host machine is stuck again but I'm not 100% sure what triggered the problem:

The following packages were being built at the same time:

- guest 2: llvm-toolchain-13

I really did a lot of testing today with no issues and just after I sent my report
to oss-security that the machine seems to be stable again, the issue showed up :(.

Sorry,
Adrian

Do you know whether IPMI features any sort of monitoring for capturing the output
of the serial console non-interactively? This way I would be able to capture the
crash besides what I have seen above.

Soft lockup should mean it's taking timer interrupts still, just not
scheduling. Do you have the hard lockup detector enabled as well? Is
there anything stuck spinning on another CPU?

Do you have the full dmesg / kernel log for this boot?

Could you try a sysrq+w to get a trace of blocked tasks?

Are you able to shut down the guests and exit qemu normally?

Thanks,
Nick

I haven't enabled it. But looking at the documentation [1] it seems we could
use it to print a backtrace once the lockup occurs.

> Do you have the full dmesg / kernel log for this boot?

I do, uploaded the messages file here: <https://people.debian.org/~glaubitz/messages-kvm-lockup.gz>

Also, I noticed there is actually a backtrace:

Not sure how to send a magic sysrequest over the IPMI serial console. Any idea?

Not after the crash. I have to hard-reboot the whole machine.

Could you try gcc-10 instead? It's testsuite has crashed the host for me
with a patched kernel twice now.

Sure, will give that a try.

I was able to crash my machine over the weekend, building openjdk, but I
haven't been able to reproduce it for ~24 hours now (I didn't change
anything).

Can you try running your guests with no SMT threads?

I think one of your guests was using:

  -smp 32,sockets=1,dies=1,cores=8,threads=4

Can you change that to:

  -smp 8,sockets=1,dies=1,cores=8,threads=1

And something similar for the other guest(s).

If the system is stable with those settings that would be useful
information, and would also mean you could use the system without it
crashing semi regularly.

cheers

I made another experiment and upgraded the host to 5.15-rc7 which contains your
fixes and made the guests build gcc-10. Interestingly, this time, the gcc-10
build crashed the guest but didn't manage to crash the host. I will update the
guest to 5.15-rc7 now as well and see how that goes.

Sure. I will try that later. But first I want to switch the guests to 5.15-rc7 as well.

Gotcha.

OK, so I'm definitely able to crash the 5.15 kernel as well:

I am pretty sure you can run something like

script ipmitool

to capture output indefinitely, and the same inside screen on a remote
machine.

Thanks

As on any serial console sending break should be equivalent to the magic
sysrq key combo.

<https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Remote-Serial-Console-HOWTO/security-sysrq.html>

With ipmitool break is sent by typing ~B

Hi Michael!

Sorry for the long time without any responses. Shall we continue debugging this?

We're currently running 5.15.x on the host system and the guests and the testsuite
for gcc-9 still reproducibly kills the KVM host.

Yes!

Sorry also that I haven't been able to fix it yet, I had to stop chasing
this bug and work on other things before the end of the year.

Have you been able to try the different -smp options I suggested?

Can you separately test with (on the host):

 # echo 0 > /sys/module/kvm_hv/parameters/dynamic_mt_modes

cheers

I'm trying to turn off "dynamic_mt_modes" first and see if that makes any difference.

I will report back.

So far the machine is running stable now and the VM built gcc-9 without
crashing the host. I will continue to monitor the machine and report back
if it crashes, but it looks like this could be it.

So, it seems that setting "dynamic_mt_modes" actually did the trick, the host is no longer
crashing. However, I have observed on two occasions now that the build VM is just suddenly
off as if someone has shut it down using the "force-off" option in the virt-manager user
interface.

Not sure why that happens.

Just as a heads-up. Ever since I set

	echo 0 > /sys/module/kvm_hv/parameters/dynamic_mt_modes

on the host machine, I never saw the crash again. So the issue seems to be related to the

I just made the huge mistake of hibernating and resuming, I'm going trough

I'll read up once the sheer panic settles.

commit 96e4ea34f6d7c3df2c8138656ccb7311633df04b
Author: Fabien Dessenne

pinctrl: stm32: use valid pin identifier in stm32\_pinctrl\_resume()
commit c370bb474016ab9edfdabd7c08a88dd13a71ddbd upstream.
When resuming from low power, the driver attempts to restore the
configuration of some pins. This is done by a call to:
stm32\_pinctrl\_restore\_gpio\_regs(struct stm32\_pinctrl \*pctl, u32 pin)
where 'pin' must be a valid pin value (i.e. matching some 'groups->pin').
Fix the current implementation which uses some wrong 'pin' value.
Fixes: e2f3cf18c3e2 ("pinctrl: stm32: add suspend/resume management")

commit 4850e9e3c6a34f7e30a6d073629d98c826698033

ARM: 9122/1: select HAVE\_FUTEX\_CMPXCHG
commit 9d417cbe36eee7afdd85c2e871685f8dab7c2dba upstream.
tglx notes:
This function [futex\_detect\_cmpxchg] is only needed when an
architecture has to runtime discover whether the CPU supports it or
not. ARM has unconditional support for this, so the obvious thing to
do is the below.

net: mdiobus: Fix memory leak in \_\_mdiobus\_register
commit ab609f25d19858513919369ff3d9a63c02cd9e2e upstream.
Once device\_register() failed, we should call put\_device() to
decrement reference count for cleanup. Or it will cause memory
leak.

bpf, test, cgroup: Use sk\_{alloc,free} for test cases
commit 435b08ec0094ac1e128afe6cfd0d9311a8c617a7 upstream.
BPF test infra has some hacks in place which kzalloc() a socket and perform
minimum init via sock\_net\_set() and sock\_init\_data(). As a result, the sk's
skcd->cgroup is NULL since it didn't go through proper initialization as it
would have been the case from sk\_alloc(). Rather than re-adding a NULL test
in sock\_cgroup\_ptr() just for this, use sk\_{alloc,free}() pair for the test
socket. The latter also allows to get rid of the bpf\_sk\_storage\_free() special
case.

s390/pci: fix zpci\_zdev\_put() on reserve
commit a46044a92add6a400f4dada7b943b30221f7cc80 upstream.
Since commit 2a671f77ee49 ("s390/pci: fix use after free of zpci\_dev")
the reference count of a zpci\_dev is incremented between
pcibios\_add\_device() and pcibios\_release\_device() which was supposed to
prevent the zpci\_dev from being freed while the common PCI code has
access to it. It was missed however that the handling of zPCI
availability events assumed that once zpci\_zdev\_put() was called no
later availability event would still see the device. With the previously
mentioned commit however this assumption no longer holds and we must
make sure that we only drop the initial long-lived reference the zPCI
subsystem holds exactly once.
Do so by introducing a zpci\_device\_reserved() function that handles when
a device is reserved. Here we make sure the zpci\_dev will not be
considered for further events by removing it from the zpci\_list.
This also means that the device actually stays in the
ZPCI\_FN\_STATE\_RESERVED state between the time we know it has been
reserved and the final reference going away. We thus need to consider it
a real state instead of just a conceptual state after the removal. The
final cleanup of PCI resources, removal from zbus, and destruction of
the IOMMU stays in zpci\_release\_device() to make sure holders of the
reference do see valid data until the release.

It's currently safe to call zpci\_cleanup\_bus\_resources() even if the

zdev->has\_resources before we call zpci\_cleanup\_bus\_resources() in

After commit ea2f0f77538c ("scsi: core: Cap scsi\_host cmd\_per\_lun at

shost->cmd\_per\_lun to a negative "short" value.

autofs: fix wait name hash calculation in autofs\_wait()
commit 25f54d08f12feb593e62cc2193fedefaf7825301 upstream.
There's a mistake in commit 2be7828c9fefc ("get rid of autofs\_getpath()")
that affects kernels from v5.13.0, basically missed because of me not
fully testing the change for Al.
The problem is that the hash calculation for the wait name qstr hasn't
been updated to account for the change to use dentry\_path\_raw(). This
prevents the correct matching an existing wait resulting in multiple
notifications being sent to the daemon for the same mount which must
not occur.
The problem wasn't discovered earlier because it only occurs when
multiple processes trigger a request for the same mount concurrently
so it only shows up in more aggressive testing.

Handling one of the features events while the other is already

rx unused desc is the desc that need attatching new buffer
before refilling to hw to receive new packet, the number of
desc need attatching new buffer is calculated using next\_to\_use
and next\_to\_clean. when next\_to\_use == next\_to\_clean, currently
hns3 driver assumes that all the desc has the buffer attatched,
but 'next\_to\_use == next\_to\_clean' also means all the desc need
attatching new buffer if hw has comsumed all the desc and the
driver has not attatched any buffer to the desc yet.
This patch adds 'refill' in desc\_cb to indicate whether a new
buffer has been refilled to a desc.

scsi: iscsi: Fix set\_param() handling
[ Upstream commit 187a580c9e7895978dcd1e627b9c9e7e3d13ca96 ]
In commit 9e67600ed6b8 ("scsi: iscsi: Fix race condition between login and
sync thread") we meant to add a check where before we call ->set\_param() we
make sure the iscsi\_cls\_connection is bound. The problem is that between
versions 4 and 5 of the patch the deletion of the unchecked set\_param()
call was dropped so we ended up with 2 calls. As a result we can still hit
a crash where we access the unbound connection on the first call.
This patch removes that first call.

Input: snvs\_pwrkey - add clk handling
[ Upstream commit d997cc1715df7b6c3df798881fb9941acf0079f8 ]
On i.MX7S and i.MX8M\* (but not i.MX6\*) the pwrkey device has an
associated clock. Accessing the registers requires that this clock is
enabled. Binding the driver on at least i.MX7S and i.MX8MP while not
having the clock enabled results in a complete hang of the machine.
(This usually only happens if snvs\_pwrkey is built as a module and the
rtc-snvs driver isn't already bound because at bootup the required clk
is on and only gets disabled when the clk framework disables unused clks
late during boot.)
This completes the fix in commit 135be16d3505 ("ARM: dts: imx7s: add
snvs clock to pwrkey").

[ Upstream commit 3ff6d64e68abc231955d216236615918797614ae ]
The `cpu` argument of perf\_evsel\_\_read() must specify the cpu index.
perf\_cpu\_map\_\_for\_each\_cpu() is for iterating the cpu number (not index)
and is thus not appropriate for use with perf\_evsel\_\_read().
So, if there is an offline CPU, the cpu number specified in the argument
may point out of range because the cpu number and the cpu index are
different.

spi-mux: Fix false-positive lockdep splats
[ Upstream commit 16a8e2fbb2d49111004efc1c7342e083eafabeb0 ]
io\_mutex is taken by spi\_setup() and spi-mux's .setup() callback calls
spi\_setup() which results in a nested lock of io\_mutex.
add\_lock is taken by spi\_add\_device(). The device\_add() call in there
can result in calling spi-mux's .probe() callback which registers its
own spi controller which in turn results in spi\_add\_device() being
called again.
To fix this initialize the controller's locks already in
spi\_alloc\_controller() to give spi\_mux\_probe() a chance to set the
lockdep subclass.

spi: Fix deadlock when adding SPI controllers on SPI buses
[ Upstream commit 6098475d4cb48d821bdf453c61118c56e26294f0 ]
Currently we have a global spi\_add\_lock which we take when adding new
devices so that we can check that we're not trying to reuse a chip
select that's already controlled. This means that if the SPI device is
itself a SPI controller and triggers the instantiation of further SPI
devices we trigger a deadlock as we try to register and instantiate
those devices while in the process of doing so for the parent controller
and hence already holding the global spi\_add\_lock. Since we only care
about concurrency within a single SPI bus move the lock to be per
controller, avoiding the deadlock.
This can be easily triggered in the case of spi-mux.

ALSA: hda: avoid write to STATESTS if controller is in reset
[ Upstream commit b37a15188eae9d4c49c5bb035e0c8d4058e4d9b3 ]
The snd\_hdac\_bus\_reset\_link() contains logic to clear STATESTS register
before performing controller reset. This code dates back to an old
bugfix in commit e8a7f136f5ed ("[ALSA] hda-intel - Improve HD-audio
codec probing robustness"). Originally the code was added to
azx\_reset().
The code was moved around in commit a41d122449be ("ALSA: hda - Embed bus
into controller object") and ended up to snd\_hdac\_bus\_reset\_link() and
called primarily via snd\_hdac\_bus\_init\_chip().
The logic to clear STATESTS is correct when snd\_hdac\_bus\_init\_chip() is
called when controller is not in reset. In this case, STATESTS can be
cleared. This can be useful e.g. when forcing a controller reset to retry
codec probe. A normal non-power-on reset will not clear the bits.
However, this old logic is problematic when controller is already in
reset. The HDA specification states that controller must be taken out of
reset before writing to registers other than GCTL.CRST (1.0a spec,
3.3.7). The write to STATESTS in snd\_hdac\_bus\_reset\_link() will be lost
if the controller is already in reset per the HDA specification mentioned.
This has been harmless on older hardware. On newer generation of Intel
PCIe based HDA controllers, if configured to report issues, this write
will emit an unsupported request error. If ACPI Platform Error Interface
(APEI) is enabled in kernel, this will end up to kernel log.
Fix the code in snd\_hdac\_bus\_reset\_link() to only clear the STATESTS if
the function is called when controller is not in reset. Otherwise
clearing the bits is not possible and should be skipped.

ALSA: hda: intel: Allow repeatedly probing on codec configuration errors
[ Upstream commit c0f1886de7e173865f1a0fa7680a1c07954a987f ]
It seems that a few recent AMD systems show the codec configuration
errors at the early boot, while loading the driver at a later stage
works magically. Although the root cause of the error isn't clear,
it's certainly not bad to allow retrying the codec probe in such a
case if that helps.
This patch adds the capability for retrying the probe upon codec probe
errors on the certain AMD platforms. The probe\_work is changed to a
delayed work, and at the secondary call, it'll jump to the codec
probing.
Note that, not only adding the re-probing, this includes the behavior
changes in the codec configuration function. Namely,
snd\_hda\_codec\_configure() won't unregister the codec at errors any
longer. Instead, its caller, azx\_codec\_configure() unregisters the
codecs with the probe failures \*if\* any codec has been successfully
configured. If all codec probe failed, it doesn't unregister but let
it re-probed -- which is the most case we're seeing and this patch
tries to improve.
Even if the driver doesn't re-probe or give up, it will go to the
"free-all" error path, hence the leftover codecs shall be disabled /
deleted in anyway.

objtool: Update section header before relocations
[ Upstream commit 86e1e054e0d2105cf32b0266cf1a64e6c26424f7 ]
The libelf implementation from elftoolchain has a safety check in
gelf\_update\_rel[a] to check that the data corresponds to a section
that has type SHT\_REL[A] [0]. If the relocation is updated before
the section header is updated with the proper type, this check
fails.
To fix this, update the section header first, before the relocations.
Previously, the section size was calculated in elf\_rebuild\_reloc\_section
by counting the number of entries in the reloc\_list. However, we
now need the size during elf\_write so instead keep a running total
and add to it for every new relocation.

The reference counting issue happens in the normal path of

function forgets to handle the returned resource object, whose refcount
increased inside, causing a refcount leak.

net: bridge: mcast: use multicast\_membership\_interval for IGMPv3
commit fac3cb82a54a4b7c49c932f96ef196cf5774344c upstream.
When I added IGMPv3 support I decided to follow the RFC for computing
the GMI dynamically:
" 8.4. Group Membership Interval
The Group Membership Interval is the amount of time that must pass
before a multicast router decides there are no more members of a
group or a particular source on a network.
This value MUST be ((the Robustness Variable) times (the Query
Interval)) plus (one Query Response Interval)."
But that actually is inconsistent with how the bridge used to compute it
for IGMPv2, where it was user-configurable that has a correct default value
but it is up to user-space to maintain it. This would make it consistent
with the other timer values which are also maintained correct by the user
instead of being dynamically computed. It also changes back to the previous
user-expected GMI behaviour for IGMPv3 queries which were supported before
IGMPv3 was added. Note that to properly compute it dynamically we would
need to add support for "Robustness Variable" which is currently missing.

to detach a register controller. if the controller
was not attached yet, detach\_capi\_ctr() would

KVM: x86: split the two parts of emulator\_pio\_in
commit 3b27de27183911d461afedf50c6fa30c59740c07 upstream.
emulator\_pio\_in handles both the case where the data is pending in
vcpu->arch.pio.count, and the case where I/O has to be done via either
an in-kernel device or a userspace exit. For SEV-ES we would like
to split these, to identify clearly the moment at which the
sev\_pio\_data is consumed. To this end, create two different
functions: \_\_emulator\_pio\_in fills in vcpu->arch.pio.count, while
complete\_emulator\_pio\_in clears it and releases vcpu->arch.pio.data.
Because this patch has to be backported, things are left a bit messy.
kernel\_pio() operates on vcpu->arch.pio, which leads to emulator\_pio\_in()
having with two calls to complete\_emulator\_pio\_in(). It will be fixed
in the next release.
While at it, remove the unused void\* val argument of emulator\_pio\_in\_out.
The function currently hardcodes vcpu->arch.pio\_data as the
source/destination buffer, which sucks but will be fixed after the more
severe SEV-ES buffer overflow.

KVM: SEV-ES: go over the sev\_pio\_data buffer in multiple passes if needed
commit 95e16b4792b0429f1933872f743410f00e590c55 upstream.
The PIO scratch buffer is larger than a single page, and therefore
it is not possible to copy it in a single step to vcpu->arch/pio\_data.
Bound each call to emulator\_pio\_in/out to a single page; keep
track of how many I/O operations are left in vcpu->arch.sev\_pio\_count,
so that the operation can be restarted in the complete\_userspace\_io
callback.
For OUT, this means that the previous kvm\_sev\_es\_outs implementation
becomes an iterator of the loop, and we can consume the sev\_pio\_data
buffer before leaving to userspace.
For IN, instead, consuming the buffer and decreasing sev\_pio\_count
is always done in the complete\_userspace\_io callback, because that
is when the memcpy is done into sev\_pio\_data.

- inline emulator\_pio\_in\_emulated and emulator\_pio\_out\_emulated,
since we already have the vCPU
- remove the data argument and pull setting vcpu->arch.sev\_pio\_data into
the caller
- remove unnecessary clearing of vcpu->arch.pio.count when
emulation is done by the kernel (and therefore vcpu->arch.pio.count
is already clear on exit from emulator\_pio\_in and emulator\_pio\_out).

KVM: SEV-ES: rename guest\_ins\_data to sev\_pio\_data
commit b5998402e3de429b5e5f9bdea08ddf77c5fd661e upstream.
We will be using this field for OUTS emulation as well, in case the
data that is pushed via OUTS spans more than one page. In that case,
there will be a need to save the data pointer across exits to userspace.
So, change the name to something that refers to any kind of PIO.
Also spell out what it is used for, namely SEV-ES.
No functional change intended.

Flush the destination page before invoking RECEIVE\_UPDATE\_DATA, as the

KVM: nVMX: promptly process interrupts delivered while in guest mode
commit 3a25dfa67fe40f3a2690af2c562e0947a78bd6a0 upstream.
Since commit c300ab9f08df ("KVM: x86: Replace late check\_nested\_events() hack with
more precise fix") there is no longer the certainty that check\_nested\_events()
tries to inject an external interrupt vmexit to L1 on every call to vcpu\_enter\_guest.
Therefore, even in that case we need to set KVM\_REQ\_EVENT. This ensures
that inject\_pending\_event() is called, and from there kvm\_check\_nested\_events().

powerpc/idle: Don't corrupt back chain when going idle
commit 496c5fe25c377ddb7815c4ce8ecfb676f051e9b6 upstream.
In isa206\_idle\_insn\_mayloss() we store various registers into the stack
red zone, which is allowed.
However inside the IDLE\_STATE\_ENTER\_SEQ\_NORET macro we save r2 again,
to 0(r1), which corrupts the stack back chain.
We used to do the same in isa206\_idle\_insn\_mayloss() itself, but we
fixed that in 73287caa9210 ("powerpc64/idle: Fix SP offsets when saving
GPRs"), however we missed that the macro also corrupts the back chain.
Corrupting the back chain is bad for debuggability but doesn't
necessarily cause a bug.
However we recently changed the stack handling in some KVM code, and it
now relies on the stack back chain being valid when it returns. The
corruption causes that code to return with r1 pointing somewhere in
kernel data, at some point LR is restored from the stack and we branch
to NULL or somewhere else invalid.
Only affects Power8 hosts running KVM guests, with dynamic\_mt\_modes
enabled (which it is by default).
The fixes tag below points to the commit that changed the KVM stack
handling, exposing this bug. The actual corruption of the back chain has
always existed since 948cf67c4726 ("powerpc: Add NAP mode support on
Power7 in HV mode").

KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Make idle\_kvm\_start\_guest() return 0 if it went to guest
commit cdeb5d7d890e14f3b70e8087e745c4a6a7d9f337 upstream.
We call idle\_kvm\_start\_guest() from power7\_offline() if the thread has
been requested to enter KVM. We pass it the SRR1 value that was returned
from power7\_idle\_insn() which tells us what sort of wakeup we're
processing.
Depending on the SRR1 value we pass in, the KVM code might enter the
guest, or it might return to us to do some host action if the wakeup
requires it.
If idle\_kvm\_start\_guest() is able to handle the wakeup, and enter the
guest it is supposed to indicate that by returning a zero SRR1 value to
us.
That was the behaviour prior to commit 10d91611f426 ("powerpc/64s:
Reimplement book3s idle code in C"), however in that commit the
handling of SRR1 was reworked, and the zeroing behaviour was lost.
Returning from idle\_kvm\_start\_guest() without zeroing the SRR1 value can
confuse the host offline code, causing the guest to crash and other
weirdness.

KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix stack handling in idle\_kvm\_start\_guest()
commit 9b4416c5095c20e110c82ae602c254099b83b72f upstream.
In commit 10d91611f426 ("powerpc/64s: Reimplement book3s idle code in
C") kvm\_start\_guest() became idle\_kvm\_start\_guest(). The old code
allocated a stack frame on the emergency stack, but didn't use the
frame to store anything, and also didn't store anything in its caller's
frame.
idle\_kvm\_start\_guest() on the other hand is written more like a normal C
function, it creates a frame on entry, and also stores CR/LR into its
callers frame (per the ABI). The problem is that there is no caller
frame on the emergency stack.
The emergency stack for a given CPU is allocated with:
paca\_ptrs[i]->emergency\_sp = alloc\_stack(limit, i) + THREAD\_SIZE;
So emergency\_sp actually points to the first address above the emergency
stack allocation for a given CPU, we must not store above it without
first decrementing it to create a frame. This is different to the
regular kernel stack, paca->kstack, which is initialised to point at an
initial frame that is ready to use.
idle\_kvm\_start\_guest() stores the backchain, CR and LR all of which
write outside the allocation for the emergency stack. It then creates a
stack frame and saves the non-volatile registers. Unfortunately the
frame it creates is not large enough to fit the non-volatiles, and so
the saving of the non-volatile registers also writes outside the
emergency stack allocation.
The end result is that we corrupt whatever is at 0-24 bytes, and 112-248
bytes above the emergency stack allocation.
In practice this has gone unnoticed because the memory immediately above
the emergency stack happens to be used for other stack allocations,
either another CPUs mc\_emergency\_sp or an IRQ stack. See the order of
calls to irqstack\_early\_init() and emergency\_stack\_init().
The low addresses of another stack are the top of that stack, and so are
only used if that stack is under extreme pressue, which essentially
never happens in practice - and if it did there's a high likelyhood we'd
crash due to that stack overflowing.
Still, we shouldn't be corrupting someone else's stack, and it is purely
luck that we aren't corrupting something else.
To fix it we save CR/LR into the caller's frame using the existing r1 on
entry, we then create a SWITCH\_FRAME\_SIZE frame (which has space for
pt\_regs) on the emergency stack with the backchain pointing to the
existing stack, and then finally we switch to the new frame on the
emergency stack.

ucounts: Fix signal ucount refcounting
commit 15bc01effefe97757ef02ca09e9d1b927ab22725 upstream.
In commit fda31c50292a ("signal: avoid double atomic counter
increments for user accounting") Linus made a clever optimization to
how rlimits and the struct user\_struct. Unfortunately that
optimization does not work in the obvious way when moved to nested
rlimits. The problem is that the last decrement of the per user
namespace per user sigpending counter might also be the last decrement
of the sigpending counter in the parent user namespace as well. Which
means that simply freeing the leaf ucount in \_\_free\_sigqueue is not
enough.
Maintain the optimization and handle the tricky cases by introducing
inc\_rlimit\_get\_ucounts and dec\_rlimit\_put\_ucounts.
By moving the entire optimization into functions that perform all of
the work it becomes possible to ensure that every level is handled
properly.
The new function inc\_rlimit\_get\_ucounts returns 0 on failure to
increment the ucount. This is different than inc\_rlimit\_ucounts which
increments the ucounts and returns LONG\_MAX if the ucount counter has
exceeded it's maximum or it wrapped (to indicate the counter needs to
decremented).
I wish we had a single user to account all pending signals to across
all of the threads of a process so this complexity was not necessary

ucounts: Move get\_ucounts from cred\_alloc\_blank to key\_change\_session\_keyring
commit 5ebcbe342b1c12fae44b4f83cbeae1520e09857e upstream.
Setting cred->ucounts in cred\_alloc\_blank does not make sense. The
uid and user\_ns are deliberately not set in cred\_alloc\_blank but
instead the setting is delayed until key\_change\_session\_keyring.
So move dealing with ucounts into key\_change\_session\_keyring as well.
Unfortunately that movement of get\_ucounts adds a new failure mode to
key\_change\_session\_keyring. I do not see anything stopping the parent
process from calling setuid and changing the relevant part of it's
cred while keyctl\_session\_to\_parent is running making it fundamentally
necessary to call get\_ucounts in key\_change\_session\_keyring. Which
means that the new failure mode cannot be avoided.
A failure of key\_change\_session\_keyring results in a single threaded
parent keeping it's existing credentials. Which results in the parent
process not being able to access the session keyring and whichever
keys are in the new keyring.
Further get\_ucounts is only expected to fail if the number of bits in
the refernece count for the structure is too few.
Since the code has no other way to report the failure of get\_ucounts
and because such failures are not expected to be common add a WARN\_ONCE
to report this problem to userspace.
Between the WARN\_ONCE and the parent process not having access to
the keys in the new session keyring I expect any failure of get\_ucounts
will be noticed and reported and we can find another way to handle this
condition. (Possibly by just making ucounts->count an atomic\_long\_t).

commit 5af82c81b2c49cfb1cad84d9eb6eab0e3d1c4842 upstream.
The put callback of a kcontrol is supposed to return 1 when the value
is changed, and this will be notified to user-space. However, some
DAPM kcontrols always return 0 (except for errors), hence the
user-space misses the update of a control value.
This patch corrects the behavior by properly returning 1 when the
value gets updated.

ALSA: usb-audio: Provide quirk for Sennheiser GSP670 Headset
commit 3c414eb65c294719a91a746260085363413f91c1 upstream.
As per discussion at: https://github.com/szszoke/sennheiser-gsp670-pulseaudio-profile/issues/13
The GSP670 has 2 playback and 1 recording device that by default are
detected in an incompatible order for alsa. This may have been done to make
it compatible for the console by the manufacturer and only affects the
latest firmware which uses its own ID.
This quirk will resolve this by reordering the channels.

commit 032146cda85566abcd1c4884d9d23e4e30a07e9a upstream.
If we open a file without read access and then pass the fd to a syscall
whose implementation calls kernel\_read\_file\_from\_fd(), we get a warning
from \_\_kernel\_read():
if (WARN\_ON\_ONCE(!(file->f\_mode & FMODE\_READ)))
This currently affects both finit\_module() and kexec\_file\_load(), but it
could affect other syscalls in the future.

Although the directory for User Mode Linux is ./arch/um; the Kconfig
symbol for this architecture is called CONFIG\_UML.
Luckily, ./scripts/checkkconfigsymbols.py warns on non-existing configs:

mm/mempolicy: do not allow illegal MPOL\_F\_NUMA\_BALANCING | MPOL\_LOCAL in mbind()
commit 6d2aec9e123bb9c49cb5c7fc654f25f81e688e8c upstream.
syzbot reported access to unitialized memory in mbind() [1]
Issue came with commit bda420b98505 ("numa balancing: migrate on fault

This commit added a new bit in MPOL\_MODE\_FLAGS, but only checked valid
combination (MPOL\_F\_NUMA\_BALANCING can only be used with MPOL\_BIND) in
do\_set\_mempolicy()
This patch moves the check in sanitize\_mpol\_flags() so that it is also
used by mbind()

userfaultfd: fix a race between writeprotect and exit\_mmap()
commit cb185d5f1ebf900f4ae3bf84cee212e6dd035aca upstream.
A race is possible when a process exits, its VMAs are removed by
exit\_mmap() and at the same time userfaultfd\_writeprotect() is called.
The race was detected by KASAN on a development kernel, but it appears
to be possible on vanilla kernels as well.
Use mmget\_not\_zero() to prevent the race as done in other userfaultfd
operations.

mm/userfaultfd: selftests: fix memory corruption with thp enabled
commit 8913970c19915bbe773d97d42989cd85b7fdc098 upstream.
In RHEL's gating selftests we've encountered memory corruption in the
uffd event test even with upstream kernel:
# ./userfaultfd anon 128 4
nr\_pages: 32768, nr\_pages\_per\_cpu: 32768

bounces: 0, mode: read, userfaults: 82 missing (82) 25196 wp (25196)
testing uffd-wp with pagemap (pgsize=4096): done
testing uffd-wp with pagemap (pgsize=2097152): done
testing events (fork, remap, remove): ERROR: nr 32427 memory corruption 0 1 (errno=0, line=963)
ERROR: faulting process failed (errno=0, line=1117)
It can be easily reproduced when global thp enabled, which is the
default for RHEL.
It's also known as a side effect of commit 0db282ba2c12 ("selftest: use
mmap instead of posix\_memalign to allocate memory", 2021-07-23), which
is imho right itself on using mmap() to make sure the addresses will be
untagged even on arm.
The problem is, for each test we allocate buffers using two
allocate\_area() calls. We assumed these two buffers won't affect each
other, however they could, because mmap() could have found that the two
buffers are near each other and having the same VMA flags, so they got
merged into one VMA.
It won't be a big problem if thp is not enabled, but when thp is
agressively enabled it means when initializing the src buffer it could
accidentally setup part of the dest buffer too when there's a shared THP
that overlaps the two regions. Then some of the dest buffer won't be
able to be trapped by userfaultfd missing mode, then it'll cause memory
corruption as described.
To fix it, do release\_pages() after initializing the src buffer.
Since the previous two release\_pages() calls are after
uffd\_test\_ctx\_clear() which will unmap all the buffers anyway (which is
stronger than release pages; as unmap() also tear town pgtables), drop
them as they shouldn't really be anything useful.
We can mark the Fixes tag upon 0db282ba2c12 as it's reported to only
happen there, however the real "Fixes" IMHO should be 8ba6e8640844, as
before that commit we'll always do explicit release\_pages() before
registration of uffd, and 8ba6e8640844 changed that logic by adding
extra unmap/map and we didn't release the pages at the right place.
Meanwhile I don't have a solid glue anyway on whether posix\_memalign()
could always avoid triggering this bug, hence it's safer to attach this
fix to commit 8ba6e8640844.

ocfs2: mount fails with buffer overflow in strlen
commit b15fa9224e6e1239414525d8d556d824701849fc upstream.
Starting with kernel 5.11 built with CONFIG\_FORTIFY\_SOURCE mouting an
ocfs2 filesystem with either o2cb or pcmk cluster stack fails with the
trace below. Problem seems to be that strings for cluster stack and
cluster name are not guaranteed to be null terminated in the disk
representation, while strlcpy assumes that the source string is always
null terminated. This causes a read outside of the source string
triggering the buffer overflow detection.

ocfs2: fix data corruption after conversion from inline format
commit 5314454ea3ff6fc746eaf71b9a7ceebed52888fa upstream.
Commit 6dbf7bb55598 ("fs: Don't invalidate page buffers in
block\_write\_full\_page()") uncovered a latent bug in ocfs2 conversion
from inline inode format to a normal inode format.
The code in ocfs2\_convert\_inline\_data\_to\_extents() attempts to zero out
the whole cluster allocated for file data by grabbing, zeroing, and
dirtying all pages covering this cluster. However these pages are
beyond i\_size, thus writeback code generally ignores these dirty pages
and no blocks were ever actually zeroed on the disk.
This oversight was fixed by commit 693c241a5f6a ("ocfs2: No need to zero
pages past i\_size.") for standard ocfs2 write path, inline conversion
path was apparently forgotten; the commit log also has a reasoning why
the zeroing actually is not needed.
After commit 6dbf7bb55598, things became worse as writeback code stopped
invalidating buffers on pages beyond i\_size and thus these pages end up
with clean PageDirty bit but with buffers attached to these pages being
still dirty. So when a file is converted from inline format, then
writeback triggers, and then the file is grown so that these pages
become valid, the invalid dirtiness state is preserved,
mark\_buffer\_dirty() does nothing on these pages (buffers are already
dirty) but page is never written back because it is clean. So data
written to these pages is lost once pages are reclaimed.
Simple reproducer for the problem is:
xfs\_io -f -c "pwrite 0 2000" -c "pwrite 2000 2000" -c "fsync" \
-c "pwrite 4000 2000" ocfs2\_file
After unmounting and mounting the fs again, you can observe that end of
'ocfs2\_file' has lost its contents.
Fix the problem by not doing the pointless zeroing during conversion
from inline format similarly as in the standard write path.

tracing: Have all levels of checks prevent recursion
commit ed65df63a39a3f6ed04f7258de8b6789e5021c18 upstream.
While writing an email explaining the "bit = 0" logic for a discussion on
making ftrace\_test\_recursion\_trylock() disable preemption, I discovered a
path that makes the "not do the logic if bit is zero" unsafe.
The recursion logic is done in hot paths like the function tracer. Thus,
any code executed causes noticeable overhead. Thus, tricks are done to try
to limit the amount of code executed. This included the recursion testing
logic.
Having recursion testing is important, as there are many paths that can
end up in an infinite recursion cycle when tracing every function in the
kernel. Thus protection is needed to prevent that from happening.
Because it is OK to recurse due to different running context levels (e.g.
an interrupt preempts a trace, and then a trace occurs in the interrupt
handler), a set of bits are used to know which context one is in (normal,
softirq, irq and NMI). If a recursion occurs in the same level, it is
prevented\*.
Then there are infrastructure levels of recursion as well. When more than
one callback is attached to the same function to trace, it calls a loop
function to iterate over all the callbacks. Both the callbacks and the
loop function have recursion protection. The callbacks use the
"ftrace\_test\_recursion\_trylock()" which has a "function" set of context
bits to test, and the loop function calls the internal
trace\_test\_and\_set\_recursion() directly, with an "internal" set of bits.
If an architecture does not implement all the features supported by ftrace
then the callbacks are never called directly, and the loop function is
called instead, which will implement the features of ftrace.
Since both the loop function and the callbacks do recursion protection, it
was seemed unnecessary to do it in both locations. Thus, a trick was made
to have the internal set of recursion bits at a more significant bit
location than the function bits. Then, if any of the higher bits were set,
the logic of the function bits could be skipped, as any new recursion
would first have to go through the loop function.
This is true for architectures that do not support all the ftrace
features, because all functions being traced must first go through the
loop function before going to the callbacks. But this is not true for
architectures that support all the ftrace features. That's because the
loop function could be called due to two callbacks attached to the same
function, but then a recursion function inside the callback could be
called that does not share any other callback, and it will be called
directly.
i.e.

Thus, the "bit == 0 skip" trick is not safe, unless the loop function is
call for all functions.
Since we want to encourage architectures to implement all ftrace features,
having them slow down due to this extra logic may encourage the
maintainers to update to the latest ftrace features. And because this
logic is only safe for them, remove it completely.
[\*] There is on layer of recursion that is allowed, and that is to allow
for the transition between interrupt context (normal -> softirq ->
irq -> NMI), because a trace may occur before the context update is
visible to the trace recursion logic.

ceph: fix handling of "meta" errors
commit 1bd85aa65d0e7b5e4d09240f492f37c569fdd431 upstream.
Currently, we check the wb\_err too early for directories, before all of
the unsafe child requests have been waited on. In order to fix that we
need to check the mapping->wb\_err later nearer to the end of ceph\_fsync.
We also have an overly-complex method for tracking errors after
blocklisting. The errors recorded in cleanup\_session\_requests go to a
completely separate field in the inode, but we end up reporting them the
same way we would for any other error (in fsync).
There's no real benefit to tracking these errors in two different
places, since the only reporting mechanism for them is in fsync, and
we'd need to advance them both every time.
Given that, we can just remove i\_meta\_err, and convert the places that
used it to instead just use mapping->wb\_err instead. That also fixes
the original problem by ensuring that we do a check\_and\_advance of the
wb\_err at the end of the fsync op.

ceph: skip existing superblocks that are blocklisted or shut down when mounting
commit 98d0a6fb7303a6f4a120b8b8ed05b86ff5db53e8 upstream.
Currently when mounting, we may end up finding an existing superblock
that corresponds to a blocklisted MDS client. This means that the new
mount ends up being unusable.
If we've found an existing superblock with a client that is already
blocklisted, and the client is not configured to recover on its own,
fail the match. Ditto if the superblock has been forcibly unmounted.
While we're in here, also rename "other" to the more conventional "fsc".

commit a4fbe70c5cb746441d56b28cf88161d9e0e25378 upstream.
The receiver should abort TP if 'total message size' in TP.CM\_RTS and
TP.CM\_BAM is less than 9 or greater than 1785 [1], but currently the
j1939 stack only checks the upper bound and the receiver will accept

This patch adds check for the lower bound and abort illegal TP.

When the session state is J1939\_SESSION\_DONE, j1939\_tp\_rxtimer() will

state is J1939\_SESSION\_DONE, then j1939\_tp\_rxtimer() give an alert.

can: isotp: isotp\_sendmsg(): fix TX buffer concurrent access in isotp\_sendmsg()
commit 43a08c3bdac4cb42eff8fe5e2278bffe0c5c3daa upstream.
When isotp\_sendmsg() concurrent, tx.state of all TX processes can be
ISOTP\_IDLE. The conditions so->tx.state != ISOTP\_IDLE and
wq\_has\_sleeper(&so->wait) can not protect TX buffer from being
accessed by multiple TX processes.
We can use cmpxchg() to try to modify tx.state to ISOTP\_SENDING firstly.
If the modification of the previous process succeed, the later process
must wait tx.state to ISOTP\_IDLE firstly. Thus, we can ensure TX buffer
is accessed by only one process at the same time. And we should also
restore the original tx.state at the subsequent error processes.

can: isotp: isotp\_sendmsg(): fix return error on FC timeout on TX path
commit d674a8f123b4096d85955c7eaabec688f29724c9 upstream.
When the a large chunk of data send and the receiver does not send a
Flow Control frame back in time, the sendmsg() does not return a error
code, but the number of bytes sent corresponding to the size of the
packet.
If a timeout occurs the isotp\_tx\_timer\_handler() is fired, sets
sk->sk\_err and calls the sk->sk\_error\_report() function. It was
wrongly expected that the error would be propagated to user space in
every case. For isotp\_sendmsg() blocking on wait\_event\_interruptible()
this is not the case.
This patch fixes the problem by checking if sk->sk\_err is set and
returning the error to user space.

net: enetc: make sure all traffic classes can send large frames

The enetc driver does not implement .ndo\_change\_mtu, instead it
configures the MAC register field PTC{Traffic Class}MSDUR[MAXSDU]
statically to a large value during probe time.
The driver used to configure only the max SDU for traffic class 0, and
that was fine while the driver could only use traffic class 0. But with
the introduction of mqprio, sending a large frame into any other TC than
0 is broken.
This patch fixes that by replicating per traffic class the static
configuration done in enetc\_configure\_port\_mac().

[ Upstream commit 13047a092c6d3f23b7d684b5b3fe46b2b50423b9 ]
Don't clear the shared DPHY registers common to MIPI Rx and MIPI Tx during
DSI initialization since this was causing MIPI Rx reset. Rest of the
writes are bitwise, so will not affect Mipi Rx side.

net/mlx5e: IPsec: Fix work queue entry ethernet segment checksum flags
[ Upstream commit 1d000323940137332d4d62c6332b6daf5f07aba7 ]
Current Work Queue Entry (WQE) checksum (csum) flags in the ethernet
segment (eseg) in case of IPsec crypto offload datapath are not aligned
with PRM/HW expectations.
Currently the driver always sets the l3\_inner\_csum flag in case of IPsec
because of the wrong usage of skb->encapsulation as indicator for inner
IPsec header since skb->encapsulation is always ON for IPsec packets
since IPsec itself is an encapsulation protocol. The above forced a
failing attempts of calculating csum of non-existing segments (like in
the IP|ESP|TCP packet case which does not have an l3\_inner) which led
to lots of packet drops hence the low throughput.
Fix by using xo->inner\_ipproto as indicator for inner IPsec header
instead of skb->encapsulation in addition to setting the csum flags
as following:
\* Tunnel Mode:
\* Pkt: MAC IP ESP IP L4
\* CSUM: l3\_cs | l3\_inner\_cs | l4\_inner\_cs
\*
\* Transport Mode:
\* Pkt: MAC IP ESP L4
\* CSUM: l3\_cs [ | l4\_cs (checksum partial case)]
\*
\* Tunnel(VXLAN TCP/UDP) over Transport Mode
\* Pkt: MAC IP ESP UDP VXLAN IP L4
\* CSUM: l3\_cs | l3\_inner\_cs | l4\_inner\_cs

net/mlx5e: IPsec: Fix a misuse of the software parser's fields
[ Upstream commit d10457f85d4ae4d32c0df0cd65358a78c577fbe6 ]
IPsec crypto offload current Software Parser (SWP) fields settings in
the ethernet segment (eseg) are not aligned with PRM/HW expectations.
Among others in case of IP|ESP|TCP packet, current driver sets the
offsets for inner\_l3 and inner\_l4 although there is no inner l3/l4
headers relative to ESP header in such packets.
SWP provides the offsets for HW ,so it can be used to find csum fields
to offload the checksum, however these are not necessarily used by HW
and are used as fallback in case HW fails to parse the packet, e.g
when performing IPSec Transport Aware (IP | ESP | TCP) there is no
need to add SW parse on inner packet. So in some cases packets csum
was calculated correctly , whereas in other cases it failed. The later
faced csum errors (caused by wrong packet length calculations) which
led to lots of packet drops hence the low throughput.
Fix by setting the SWP fields as expected in a IP|ESP|TCP packet.
the following describe the expected SWP offsets:
\* Tunnel Mode:
\* SWP: OutL3 InL3 InL4
\* Pkt: MAC IP ESP IP L4
\*
\* Transport Mode:
\* SWP: OutL3 OutL4
\* Pkt: MAC IP ESP L4
\*
\* Tunnel(VXLAN TCP/UDP) over Transport Mode
\* SWP: OutL3 InL3 InL4

Currently when there is a rx page allocation failure, it is
possible that polling may be stopped if there is no more packet
to be reveiced, which may cause queue stall problem under memory
pressure.
This patch makes sure polling is scheduled again when there is
any rx page allocation failure, and polling will try to allocate
receive buffers until it succeeds.
Now the allocation retry is added, it is unnecessary to do the rx
page allocation at the end of rx cleaning, so remove it. And reset
the unused\_count to zero after calling hns3\_nic\_alloc\_rx\_buffers()
to avoid calling hns3\_nic\_alloc\_rx\_buffers() repeatedly under
memory pressure.

get:

This is because powerpc's arch\_cpu\_idle\_dead() decrements the idle task's
preempt count, for reasons explained in commit a7c2bb8279d2 ("powerpc:

expects a preempt\_count() of 0."
However, since commit 2c669ef6979c ("powerpc/preempt: Don't touch the idle
task's preempt\_count during hotplug") and commit f1a0a376ca0c ("sched/core:
Initialize the idle task with preemption disabled"), that justification no
longer holds.
The idle task isn't supposed to re-enable preemption, so remove the
vestigial preempt\_enable() from the CPU offline path.
Tested with pseries and powernv in qemu, and pseries on PowerVM.

hamradio: baycom\_epp: fix build for UML
[ Upstream commit 0a9bb11a5e298e72b675255a4bb2893513000584 ]

tcp: md5: Fix overlap between vrf and non-vrf keys
[ Upstream commit 86f1e3a8489f6a0232c1f3bc2bdb379f5ccdecec ]
With net.ipv4.tcp\_l3mdev\_accept=1 it is possible for a listen socket to
accept connection from the same client address in different VRFs. It is
also possible to set different MD5 keys for these clients which differ
only in the tcpm\_l3index field.
This appears to work when distinguishing between different VRFs but not
between non-VRF and VRF connections. In particular:
\* tcp\_md5\_do\_lookup\_exact will match a non-vrf key against a vrf key.
This means that adding a key with l3index != 0 after a key with l3index
== 0 will cause the earlier key to be deleted. Both keys can be present
if the non-vrf key is added later.
\* \_tcp\_md5\_do\_lookup can match a non-vrf key before a vrf key. This
casues failures if the passwords differ.
Fix this by making tcp\_md5\_do\_lookup\_exact perform an actual exact
comparison on l3index and by making \_\_tcp\_md5\_do\_lookup perfer
vrf-bound keys above other considerations like prefixlen.

There are many features in the driver that depend on the major, minor,

fw.mgmt.api debugging issues related to the FW API version is difficult.

ice: Avoid crash from unnecessary IDA free
[ Upstream commit 73e30a62b19b9fbb4e6a3465c59da186630d5f2e ]
In the remove path, there is an attempt to free the aux\_idx IDA whether
it was allocated or not. This can potentially cause a crash when
unloading the driver on systems that do not initialize support for RDMA.
But, this free cannot be gated by the status bit for RDMA, since it is
allocated if the driver detects support for RDMA at probe time, but the
driver can enter into a state where RDMA is not supported after the IDA
has been allocated at probe time and this would lead to a memory leak.
Initialize aux\_idx to an invalid value and check for a valid value when
unloading to determine if an IDA free is necessary.

ice: Fix failure to re-add LAN/RDMA Tx queues
[ Upstream commit ff7e93219442f5ac5b2cfd33e4fe4b7d5942f957 ]
Currently if the VSI is rebuilt/removed and the RDMA PF driver is active
the RDMA Tx queue scheduler node configuration will not be cleaned up.
This will cause the rebuild/re-add of the VSI to fail due to the
software structures not being correctly cleaned up for the VSI index.
Fix this by always calling ice\_rm\_vsi\_rdma\_cfg() for all VSI. If there
are no RDMA scheduler nodes created, then there is no harm in calling
ice\_rm\_vsi\_rdma\_cfg(). This change applies to all VSI types, so if
RDMA support is added for other VSI types they will also get this
change.

[ Upstream commit 6b9b546dc00797c74bef491668ce5431ff54e1e2 ]
There is a noise issue for 8kHz sample rate on slave mode.
Compared with master mode, the difference is the DACDIV
setting, after correcting the DACDIV, the noise is gone.
There is no noise issue for 48kHz sample rate, because
the default value of DACDIV is correct for 48kHz.
So wm8960\_configure\_clocking() should be functional for
ADC and DAC function even if it is slave mode.
In order to be compatible for old use case, just add
condition for checking that sysclk is zero with
slave mode.

dma-debug: fix sg checks in debug\_dma\_map\_sg()
[ Upstream commit 293d92cbbd2418ca2ba43fed07f1b92e884d1c77 ]
The following warning occurred sporadically on s390:
DMA-API: nvme 0006:00:00.0: device driver maps memory from kernel text or rodata [addr=0000000048cc5e2f] [len=131072]
WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 825 at kernel/dma/debug.c:1083 check\_for\_illegal\_area+0xa8/0x138
It is a false-positive warning, due to broken logic in debug\_dma\_map\_sg().
check\_for\_illegal\_area() checks for overlay of sg elements with kernel text
or rodata. It is called with sg\_dma\_len(s) instead of s->length as
parameter. After the call to ->map\_sg(), sg\_dma\_len() will contain the
length of possibly combined sg elements in the DMA address space, and not
the individual sg element length, which would be s->length.
The check will then use the physical start address of an sg element, and
add the DMA length for the overlap check, which could result in the false
warning, because the DMA length can be larger than the actual single sg
element length.
In addition, the call to check\_for\_illegal\_area() happens in the iteration
over mapped\_ents, which will not include all individual sg elements if
any of them were combined in ->map\_sg().
Fix this by using s->length instead of sg\_dma\_len(s). Also put the call to
check\_for\_illegal\_area() in a separate loop, iterating over all the
individual sg elements ("nents" instead of "mapped\_ents").
While at it, as suggested by Robin Murphy, also move check\_for\_stack()
inside the new loop, as it is similarly concerned with validating the
individual sg elements.

VM\_SHARED mappings are currently forbidden in a memslot with MTE to
prevent two VMs racing to sanitise the same page. However, this check
is performed while holding current->mm's mmap\_lock, but fails to release
it. Fix this by releasing the lock when needed.

KVM: arm64: Fix host stage-2 PGD refcount
[ Upstream commit 1d58a17ef54599506d44c45ac95be27273a4d2b1 ]
The KVM page-table library refcounts the pages of concatenated stage-2
PGDs individually. However, when running KVM in protected mode, the
host's stage-2 PGD is currently managed by EL2 as a single high-order
compound page, which can cause the refcount of the tail pages to reach 0
when they shouldn't, hence corrupting the page-table.
Fix this by introducing a new hyp\_split\_page() helper in the EL2 page
allocator (matching the kernel's split\_page() function), and make use of
it from host\_s2\_zalloc\_pages\_exact().

Commit 25d27c4f68d2 ("ASoC: pcm512x: Add support for more data formats")
breaks the TSE-850 device, which is using a pcm5142 in I2S and
CBM\_CFS mode (maybe not relevant). Without this fix, the result
is:
pcm512x 0-004c: Failed to set data format: -16
And after that, no sound.
This fix is not 100% correct. The datasheet of at least the pcm5142
states that four bits (0xcc) in the I2S\_1 register are "RSV"
("Reserved. Do not access.") and no hint is given as to what the
initial values are supposed to be. So, specifying defaults for
these bits is wrong. But perhaps better than a broken driver?

xtensa: xtfpga: Try software restart before simulating CPU reset
[ Upstream commit 012e974501a270d8dfd4ee2039e1fdf7579c907e ]
Rebooting xtensa images loaded with the '-kernel' option in qemu does
not work. When executing a reboot command, the qemu session either hangs
or experiences an endless sequence of error messages.
Kernel panic - not syncing: Unrecoverable error in exception handler
Reset code jumps to the CPU restart address, but Linux can not recover
from there because code and data in the kernel init sections have been
discarded and overwritten at this point.
XTFPGA platforms have a means to reset the CPU by writing 0xdead into a
specific FPGA IO address. When used in QEMU the kernel image loaded with
the '-kernel' option gets restored to its original state allowing the
machine to boot successfully.
Use that mechanism to attempt a platform reset. If it does not work,
fall back to the existing mechanism.

r8152: avoid to resubmit rx immediately
[ Upstream commit baf33d7a75642b4b38a87fdf1cd96b506df4849f ]
For the situation that the disconnect event comes very late when the
device is unplugged, the driver would resubmit the RX bulk transfer
after getting the callback with -EPROTO immediately and continually.
Finally, soft lockup occurs.
This patch avoids to resubmit RX immediately. It uses a workqueue to
schedule the RX NAPI. And the NAPI would resubmit the RX. It let the
disconnect event have opportunity to stop the submission before soft
lockup.

xen/x86: prevent PVH type from getting clobbered
[ Upstream commit 9172b5c4a778da1f855b2e3780b1afabb3cfd523 ]
Like xen\_start\_flags, xen\_domain\_type gets set before .bss gets cleared.
Hence this variable also needs to be prevented from getting put in .bss,
which is possible because XEN\_NATIVE is an enumerator evaluating to
zero. Any use prior to init\_hvm\_pv\_info() setting the variable again
would lead to wrong decisions; one such case is xenboot\_console\_setup()
when called as a result of "earlyprintk=xen".
Use \_\_ro\_after\_init as more applicable than either \_\_section(".data") or
\_\_read\_mostly.

KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Make idle\_kvm\_start\_guest() return 0 if it went to guestWe call idle\_kvm\_start\_guest() from power7\_offline() if the thread has
been requested to enter KVM. We pass it the SRR1 value that was returned
from power7\_idle\_insn() which tells us what sort of wakeup we're
processing.
Depending on the SRR1 value we pass in, the KVM code might enter the
guest, or it might return to us to do some host action if the wakeup
requires it.
If idle\_kvm\_start\_guest() is able to handle the wakeup, and enter the
guest it is supposed to indicate that by returning a zero SRR1 value to
us.
That was the behaviour prior to commit 10d91611f426 ("powerpc/64s:
Reimplement book3s idle code in C"), however in that commit the
handling of SRR1 was reworked, and the zeroing behaviour was lost.
Returning from idle\_kvm\_start\_guest() without zeroing the SRR1 value can
confuse the host offline code, causing the guest to crash and other
weirdness.
