The provided content relates to CVE-2021-43835.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `ProfileController`'s `putAction` in Sulu, specifically how user data was being handled during updates via the API. The `putAction` allowed users with admin UI access to modify their permissions via the API, giving themselves access to areas they were not supposed to have. This was due to insufficient input validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Users with access to the admin UI could use the API to grant themselves additional permissions.
- **Inadequate Input Validation:** The `ProfileController` did not properly filter or sanitize the input data, which allowed for manipulation of user roles/permissions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with existing admin UI access can elevate their privileges and gain access to areas of the application they were not originally authorized to.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the API endpoint used to update user profiles (specifically the `putAction` of the `ProfileController`).
- An authenticated user with access to the admin UI can send a crafted API request to elevate their privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have an existing user account with access to the admin UI of the affected Sulu instance.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the API endpoint and the structure of the data that can be sent through the API to perform the privilege escalation.
