  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2021-43036",
      "root_cause": "The Unitrends backup appliance includes an undocumented PostgreSQL database account 'wguest' with a weak password 'wguest'.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Undocumented database account",
        "Weak password",
        "Insufficient access control"
      ],
      "impact": "The weak 'wguest' account can be used as a stepping stone to gain higher privileges, eventually leading to remote command execution as the postgres user and root privilege escalation. Specifically, the 'wguest' account has USAGE privilege to execute user defined functions (UDFs), which can be exploited for command injection via a vulnerable Perl trigger function that shells out to the OS.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network access to the PostgreSQL database server (port 5432)",
        "Use of the weak 'wguest' account credentials",
         "Abuse of USAGE privilege on user defined functions (UDF) in the bp schema.",
        "Command Injection through a vulnerable Perl trigger function via a database table in the public schema"
      ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs network access to the Unitrends Backup Appliance PostgreSQL database server (typically port 5432) and the knowledge of the 'wguest' credentials."
