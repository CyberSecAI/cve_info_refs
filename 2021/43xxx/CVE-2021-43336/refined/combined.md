SSA-301589: Multiple File Parsing Vulnerabilities in Solid Edge,
JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

2022-02-08

V1.3

SUMMARY

Siemens has released updates for JT2Go, Solid Edge and Teamcenter Visualization to ﬁx multiple ﬁle
parsing vulnerabilities. If a user is tricked to open a malicious ﬁle (crafted as PDF, DXF or PAR) with
any of the affected products, this could lead the application to crash or potentially lead to arbitrary code
execution.

Siemens has released updates for some of the affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens is preparing further updates and recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products
where updates are not yet available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Avoid to open untrusted ﬁles from unknown sources in affected products

Product speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

JT2Go is a 3D JT viewing tool to allow users to view JT, PDF, Solid Edge, PLM XML with available JT,
VFZ, CGM, and TIF data.

Solid Edge is a portfolio of software tools that addresses various product development processes: 3D
design, simulation, manufacturing and design management.

Teamcenter Visualization software enables enterprises to enhance their product lifecycle management
(PLM) environment with a comprehensive family of visualization solutions. The software enables enter-
prise users to access documents, 2D drawings and 3D models in a single environment.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

## Siemens JT2Go DXF File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-22-334ZDI-CAN-15107

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-43336](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43336) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | Siemens |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [JT2Go](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/plm-components/jt2go.html) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Siemens JT2Go. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. Crafted data in a DXF file can trigger a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Siemens has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

SSA-491245: Multiple File Parsing Vulnerabilities in Solid Edge

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

2023-02-14
2023-03-14
V1.1

SUMMARY

Solid Edge is affected by multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the
application reads specially crafted ﬁles in various formats such as X_B, DWG, DXF, STL, STP, SLDPRT
and PAR format. If a user is tricked to open a malicious ﬁle with the affected applications, an attacker
could leverage the vulnerability to crash the application, extract data or potentially lead to arbitrary code
execution.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

• Do not open untrusted X_B, DWG, DXF, STL, STP, SLDPRT and PAR ﬁles in Solid Edge

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Solid Edge is a portfolio of software tools that addresses various product development processes: 3D
design, simulation, manufacturing and design management.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
