{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `Instance` object in Lucet's `lucet-runtime` was being deallocated before the destructors of all its fields had completed, creating a use-after-free vulnerability if another thread reallocated the memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free vulnerability due to improper object lifecycle management during deallocation.",
      "Race condition caused by premature memory release back to the pool allocator."
    ],
    "impact": "Memory corruption, data races, and other related issues due to a use-after-free.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploitation requires triggering the `Instance` object's drop and concurrent allocation of its memory by another thread."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to influence the lifecycle and memory allocation of `Instance` objects, including the potential to create new threads. No specific user interaction is required."
  },
  "additional_details": {
        "patch_description": "The vulnerability was resolved by modifying the `InstanceHandle` destructor to ensure that the underlying memory for the `Instance` is not returned to the memory pool until after all of the `Instance` object's destructors have been executed, thus preventing the race condition.",
