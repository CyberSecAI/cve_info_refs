The provided content describes a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "WPO365 | LOGIN" WordPress plugin, identified as CVE-2021-43409.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability occurs due to the lack of sanitization of the `error_description` POST parameter when rendering error messages within the WPO365 dashboard.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, also known as Stored or Second-Order XSS.
- Lack of input sanitization for the `error_description` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject malicious script content into the application.
- When a WordPress administrator accesses the WordPress Dashboard, the malicious script executes, potentially allowing for:
  - Session hijacking
  - Account takeover
  - Access to sensitive data
  - Adding other administrative users
  - Changing application settings
  - Full control of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the target application, including a malicious payload within the `error_description` parameter.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the crafted error message is rendered in the WordPress Dashboard when a user accesses the WPO365 login page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker can be any anonymous user.
- The attacker does not need specific privileges or access to the WordPress dashboard initially. They only need to send a malicious HTTP POST request.
- The injected payload executes when a WordPress administrator authenticates and accesses the WordPress Dashboard.
