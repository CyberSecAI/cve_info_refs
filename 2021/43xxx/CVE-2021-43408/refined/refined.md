### Summary
The provided content details a SQL Injection vulnerability, identified as CVE-2021-43408, in the "Duplicate Post" WordPress plugin, specifically in versions up to and including 1.1.9.

### Root cause of vulnerability
The root cause is the insecure inclusion of the `$id` parameter, which is passed into the `cdp_insert_post` function, directly into an SQL query without proper sanitization.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection, where an attacker-controlled input is directly used in an SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

### Impact of exploitation
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete data in the WordPress database. In some cases, it could lead to the execution of system commands or access to the local file system.

### Attack vectors
The vulnerability can be exploited through the `wp_ajax_cdp_action_handling` WordPress AJAX callback by sending a POST request with a crafted `id` parameter.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with permission to use the "Duplicate Post" plugin. By default, this is limited to administrators, but the plugin can grant access to other roles like Editor, Author, Contributor, and Subscriber.
The attacker needs to make an HTTP request with a malicious `id` parameter which will be injected into SQL statement.

### Additional Information
- The vulnerability exists in the `posthandler.php` file within the `cdp_insert_post` function, specifically line 512 for version 1.1.9
- Although the `id` parameter is passed through `cdp_sanitize_array`, which uses `sanitize_text_field`, this only escapes quote characters. However, the vulnerability exists because the code expects an integer instead of a string, and quote characters aren't needed to manipulate the SQL query.
- The provided exploit uses the `sleep()` function to demonstrate the vulnerability via a measurable time delay.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 19/10/2021, and a fix was released in version 1.2.0 within the hour.
