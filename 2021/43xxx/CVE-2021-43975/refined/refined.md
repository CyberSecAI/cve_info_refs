    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-43975",
    "description": "Brendan Dolan-Gavitt reported a flaw in the hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait() function in the aQuantia AQtion ethernet device driver which can result in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code.",
    "affected_component": "aQuantia AQtion ethernet device driver",
    "root_cause": "The `hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait` function in the aQuantia AQtion ethernet device driver does not properly validate the lengths of data received from IO operations, allowing out-of-bounds read and write.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Out-of-bounds write"
     ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (crash) or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "A compromised or malfunctioning device can send crafted data via IO operations, triggering the out-of-bounds read and write.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs the ability to communicate with the affected device, either through a compromised device or by using a malfunctioning device."
