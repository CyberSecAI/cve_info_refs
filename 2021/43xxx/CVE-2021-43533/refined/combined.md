#### [#CVE-2021-38503: iframe sandbox rules did not apply to XSLT stylesheets](#CVE-2021-38503)

Reporter
Armin Ebert
Impact
high
##### Description

The iframe sandbox rules were not correctly applied to XSLT stylesheets, allowing an iframe to bypass restrictions such as executing scripts or navigating the top-level frame.

#### [#CVE-2021-38504: Use-after-free in file picker dialog](#CVE-2021-38504)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan
Impact
high
##### Description

When interacting with an HTML input element's file picker dialog with `webkitdirectory` set, a use-after-free could have resulted, leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2021-38505: Windows 10 Cloud Clipboard may have recorded sensitive user data](#CVE-2021-38505)

Reporter
Sergey Galich
Impact
high
##### Description

Microsoft introduced a new feature in Windows 10 known as Cloud Clipboard which, if enabled, will record data copied to the clipboard to the cloud, and make it available on other computers in certain scenarios. Applications that wish to prevent copied data from being recorded in Cloud History must use specific clipboard formats; and Firefox before versions 94 and ESR 91.3 did not implement them. This could have caused sensitive data to be recorded to a user's Microsoft account.
*This bug only affects Firefox for Windows 10+ with Cloud Clipboard enabled. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2021-38506: Firefox could be coaxed into going into fullscreen mode without notification or warning](#CVE-2021-38506)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan
Impact
high
##### Description

Through a series of navigations, Firefox could have entered fullscreen mode without notification or warning to the user. This could lead to spoofing attacks on the browser UI including phishing.

#### [#CVE-2021-38507: Opportunistic Encryption in HTTP2 could be used to bypass the Same-Origin-Policy on services hosted on other ports](#CVE-2021-38507)

Reporter
Takeshi Terada
Impact
high
##### Description

The Opportunistic Encryption feature of HTTP2 (RFC 8164) allows a connection to be transparently upgraded to TLS while retaining the visual properties of an HTTP connection, including being same-origin with unencrypted connections on port 80. However, if a second encrypted port on the same IP address (e.g. port 8443) did not opt-in to opportunistic encryption; a network attacker could forward a connection from the browser to port 443 to port 8443, causing the browser to treat the content of port 8443 as same-origin with HTTP. This was resolved by disabling the Opportunistic Encryption feature, which had low usage.

#### [#CVE-2021-43530: Universal XSS in Firefox for Android via QR Code URLs](#CVE-2021-43530)

Reporter
Hafiizh
Impact
high
##### Description

A Universal XSS vulnerability was present in Firefox for Android resulting from improper sanitization when processing a URL scanned from a QR code.
*This bug only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2021-38508: Permission Prompt could be overlaid, resulting in user confusion and potential spoofing](#CVE-2021-38508)

Reporter
Raphael
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By displaying a form validity message in the correct location at the same time as a permission prompt (such as for geolocation), the validity message could have obscured the prompt, resulting in the user potentially being tricked into granting the permission.

* [Bug 1366818](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1366818)

#### [#CVE-2021-43531: Web Extensions could access pre-redirect URL when their context menu was triggered by a user](#CVE-2021-43531)

Reporter
Rob Wu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a user loaded a Web Extensions context menu, the Web Extension could access the post-redirect URL of the element clicked. If the Web Extension lacked the WebRequest permission for the hosts involved in the redirect, this would be a same-origin-violation leaking data the Web Extension should have access to. This was fixed to provide the pre-redirect URL. This is related to CVE-2021-43532 but in the context of Web Extensions.

* [Bug 1659155](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1659155)

#### [#CVE-2021-38509: Javascript alert box could have been spoofed onto an arbitrary domain](#CVE-2021-38509)

Reporter
Ademar Nowasky Junior
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Due to an unusual sequence of attacker-controlled events, a Javascript `alert()` dialog with arbitrary (although unstyled) contents could be displayed over top an uncontrolled webpage of the attacker's choosing.

#### [#CVE-2021-38510: Download Protections were bypassed by .inetloc files on Mac OS](#CVE-2021-38510)

Reporter
Hou JingYi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The executable file warning was not presented when downloading .inetloc files, which can run commands on a user's computer.
*Note: This issue only affected Mac OS operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

* [Bug 1731779](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1731779)

#### [#CVE-2021-43532: 'Copy Image Link' context menu action could have been abused to see authentication tokens](#CVE-2021-43532)

Reporter
Ademar Nowasky Junior
Impact
low
##### Description

The 'Copy Image Link' context menu action would copy the final image URL after redirects. By embedding an image that triggered authentication flows - in conjunction with a Content Security Policy that stopped a redirection chain in the middle - the final image URL could be one that contained an authentication token used to takeover a user account. If a website tricked a user into copy and pasting the image link back to the page, the page would be able to steal the authentication tokens. This was fixed by making the action return the original URL, before any redirects.

#### [#CVE-2021-43533: URL Parsing may incorrectly parse internationalized domains](#CVE-2021-43533)

Reporter
Taiga Shirakura
Impact
low
##### Description

When parsing internationalized domain names, high bits of the characters in the URLs were sometimes stripped, resulting in inconsistencies that could lead to user confusion or attacks such as phishing.

#### [#CVE-2021-43534: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 94 and Firefox ESR 91.3](#CVE-2021-43534)

Reporter
Mozilla developers
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Valentin Gosu, and Andrew McCreight reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 93 and Firefox ESR 91.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

Firefox 90.0.2 (Latest MacOS/Windows)

Firefox's URL parser cannot correctly parse IDNA(Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications).

You can check the behavior with the following HTML and JavaScript.

[HTML Sample] <a href="[http://xn--あああ.example.com">URL</a>](http://xn--%E3%81%82%E3%81%82%E3%81%82.example.com%22%3EURL%EF%BF%BD/a%3E)

[JavaScript Sample] new URL("[http://xn--あああ.example.com").href](http://xn--%E3%81%82%E3%81%82%E3%81%82.example.com%22).href)

("あ" is U+3042 character)

Actual behavior:

"<http://xn--bbb.example.com>"

Expected behavior:

"xn--あああ" is an invalid label for a domain name. Only alphanumeric characters are allowed after "xn--". Browsers should treat it as an error.

<Security Risk>

* Bypassing WAF and malware scanning
* Phishing
* Inconsistencies with applications that expect to be RFC compliant

<Cause of the problem>

The codepoint for "あ" is U+3042, and the codepoint for "B" is "U+0042.

I think Firefox's URL parser ignore the upper bytes of the string following "xn--" and try to interpret it.

<Other URLs that can be interpreted incorrectly>

[http://👨‍🦰.tk](http://%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%A6%B0.tk)

(This is the domain name I got.）

The codepoints sequence for the 👨‍🦰 emoji is U+1F468 U+200D U+1F9B0.

Actual Parsed Result [Firefox]:

<http://xn--1ugz855p6kd.tk>

Expected Parsed Result [ Chrome, ICU (International Components for Unicode) ]:

<http://xn--qq8hq8f.tk/>

(Removed Zero Width Joiner(U+200D) )

<Note>

Apple Safari has the same problem. I have already reported the issue to apple.

I think this stems from the fact that when [NormalizingIDN](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/67637695876e27ddbfb6ff99202bb1c951de847a/netwerk/base/nsStandardURL.cpp#618,631) we first convert to IDN, then to ASCII, instead of the other way around as the URL standard says.

This is a remnant from the times when we used to keep URLs internally as unicode.

This URL ( [http://👨‍🦰.tk](http://%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%A6%B0.tk) ) also fails in the reference URL parser, so I'm not sure if the ZWJ is something we need to add to the spec? Anne?

I think the emoji difference is a result of Chrome not using Nontransitional\_Processing: <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=694157>.

Seems like it might be best to let this bake for another cycle rather than uplifting to Beta the week prior to RC. Feel free to NI me if you strongly disagree.

We fixed the first part of this (non-ASCII in an `xn--` prefixed label) but now treat [http://www.👨‍🦰.tk](http://www.%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%A6%B0.tk) as an invalid URL. I guess that's better than opening the wrong site, but Chrome does open it. Opened [bug 1732963](/show_bug.cgi?id=1732963 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Firefox doesn't open Emoji domain that chrome does") for this remaining piece/regression.

I have reproduced the issue using Nightly 91.0a1 on Windows 10, Mac 11 and Ubuntu 20. I can confirm this issue is fixed using provided HTML sample, I verified using Nightly 94.0a1 (2021-09-28)(64-bit) on Windows 10, Mac 11 and Ubuntu 20.

1. Open devtools console
2. Check that executing `new URL("http://xn--あああ.example.com").href` throws an error in recent builds

Yes. The WPT tests have changed a little since 91 - I'll request uplift as soon as the try run is complete:

### ESR Uplift Approval Request

* **If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration**: See [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1724233#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - IDNA does not conform to RFC and is interpreted as a different hostname"):

> * Bypassing WAF and malware scanning
> * Phishing
> * Inconsistencies with applications that expect to be RFC compliant

* **User impact if declined**: Potentially broken IDNA parsing for some domains.
* **Fix Landed on Version**: 94
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Medium
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: There's a potential for regressions stemming from the fact that this makes URL parsing more strict.

  Also, since Chrome is using Transitional processing for IDNA and we're using NonTransitional, there's a small chance of webcompat issues for rare domains containing ZWJ especially.
* **String or UUID changes made by this patch**:

I verified using esr 91.3 on Windows 10, Mac 11 and Ubuntu 20, I can confirm this issue is fixed using provided HTML sample.
