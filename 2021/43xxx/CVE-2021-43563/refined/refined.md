- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The extension `pixx.io integration for TYPO3 (DAM)` fails to restrict image downloads to the configured `pixx.io DAM` URL, which leads to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Broken access control in the bundled media browser allows unauthenticated requests to the `pixx.io API`. The extension also bundles a vulnerable version of jQuery.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE)
    - Broken Access Control
    - Use of vulnerable 3rd Party Component (jQuery 3.3.1)
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - SSRF can allow an attacker to download content from remote locations and save it to a user-controlled filename, leading to potential Remote Code Execution.
    - Broken Access Control allows an unauthenticated attacker to download media files from the DAM system via the `pixx.io API`.
    - Vulnerable jQuery version can be exploited through known vulnerabilities.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - SSRF and RCE: Requires a TYPO3 backend user account.
    - Broken Access Control: Can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - For SSRF and RCE, the attacker needs a TYPO3 backend user account.
    - For Broken Access Control, no authentication is required.
