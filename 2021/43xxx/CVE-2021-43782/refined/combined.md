# Indirect LDAP injection via the ldap\_id attribute of a user

Moderate

[LeSuisse](/LeSuisse)
published
GHSA-887w-pv2r-x8pm
Dec 15, 2021

## Package

tuleap
(tuleap)

## Affected versions

< 13.2.99.31, >= 13.1-1 && < 13.1-5, >= 13.2-1 && < 13.2-2

## Patched versions

13.2.99.31, 13.1-5, 13.2-3

## Description

### Impact

Tuleap does not sanitize properly the search filter built from the ldap\_id attribute of a user during the daily synchronization.

A malicious user could force accounts to be suspended or take over another account by forcing the update of the ldap\_uid attribute. Note that the malicious user either need to have site administrator capability on the Tuleap instance or be an LDAP operator with the capability to create/modify account. The Tuleap instance needs to have the LDAP plugin activated and enabled for this issue to be exploitable.

### Patches

The following versions contain the fix:

* Tuleap Community Edition 13.2.99.31
* Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.1-5
* Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.2-3

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, reach out to us via the contact information provided on the [Tuleap.org security page](https://www.tuleap.org/security/).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Indirect LDAP injection via the ldap\_id attribute of a user when checking if it exists

Moderate

[LeSuisse](/LeSuisse)
published
GHSA-cwv9-hhm4-jr84
Dec 15, 2021

## Package

tuleap
(tuleap)

## Affected versions

< 13.2.99.83, >= 13.1-1 && < 13.1-6, >= 13.2-1 && < 13.2-4

## Patched versions

13.2.99.83, 13.1-6, 13.2-4

## Description

This is a follow up to [GHSA-887w-pv2r-x8pm/CVE-2021-41276](https://github.com/Enalean/tuleap/security/advisories/GHSA-887w-pv2r-x8pm), the initial fix was incomplete.

### Impact

Tuleap does not sanitize properly the search filter built from the ldap\_id attribute of a user during the daily synchronization.

A malicious user could force accounts to be suspended or take over another account by forcing the update of the ldap\_uid attribute. Note that the malicious user either need to have site administrator capability on the Tuleap instance or be an LDAP operator with the capability to create/modify account. The Tuleap instance needs to have the LDAP plugin activated and enabled for this issue to be exploitable.

### Patches

The following versions contain the fix:

* Tuleap Community Edition 13.2.99.83
* Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.1-6
* Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.2-4

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
