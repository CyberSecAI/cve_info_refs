Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2021-43782.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by Tuleap not properly sanitizing the search filter built from the `ldap_id` attribute of a user during the daily synchronization process. This occurs when checking if the user still exists in the LDAP directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **LDAP Injection:** The primary weakness is an indirect LDAP injection vulnerability. The `ldap_id` attribute is not properly escaped, allowing a malicious user to inject arbitrary LDAP queries.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-controlled input (`ldap_id`) before using it in an LDAP search filter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploit could lead to:
- **Account Suspension:** An attacker can force the suspension of user accounts.
- **Account Takeover:** By manipulating the `ldap_uid` attribute, an attacker can potentially take over another user's account.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **High Privileges:** The attacker needs to have either site administrator capabilities on the Tuleap instance or be an LDAP operator with the ability to create/modify accounts.
- **LDAP Plugin Enabled:** The Tuleap instance must have the LDAP plugin activated and enabled for this vulnerability to be exploitable.
- **Malicious User:** The attacker needs to be a malicious user with a valid account and high privileges.

**Additional notes:**
- This vulnerability is a follow-up to a previous vulnerability (CVE-2021-41276) where the initial fix was incomplete.
- The issue was identified through Psalm taint analysis.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-90 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')).
- The CVSS v3 score is 6.7, which is considered moderate severity, with high impact on Confidentiality and Integrity and Low Impact on Availability.
- The fix involves escaping the `ldap_id` attribute using `ldap_escape()` before building the LDAP query.
