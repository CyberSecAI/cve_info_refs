Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input when generating the `data-text` attribute of HTML elements within the jquery.terminal library. Specifically, double quotes (`"`) were not being escaped with `&quot;` when formatting was enabled, and outside of formatting, no escaping was applied. This allowed for the injection of arbitrary HTML attributes containing malicious code, which could lead to self-XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Self-XSS:** The primary vulnerability is a self-XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) issue. User input was directly used in HTML attributes without proper sanitization.
- **Improper Input Handling:** The library failed to sanitize or encode special characters, specifically double quotes, within the input when generating the data-text attribute.
- **Inconsistent escaping:** Different code paths handled escaping of user input differently (formatting enabled vs disabled), leading to a vulnerability when formatting is disabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** While the javascript code is added to a span tag which doesn't allow for automatic execution like `onerror`, with techniques the attacker could execute javascript code.
- **Limited Scope:** The scope of this XSS is self-XSS which means that the attacker would have to convince a user of the application to enter the malicious code in the terminal. The attacker has to trick user to execute their code, as it is visible in the HTML.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** If the application utilizes the execHash option and executes code from the URL, the vulnerability can be exploited via a malicious URL.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct Input:** The vulnerability can be triggered by directly entering a malicious payload in the terminal, such as `onclick="alert(1);"`.
- **Malicious URL:** If `execHash` option is used by the application, the attacker could create a URL with the payload and convince a user to open it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs the user to input malicious text into the terminal.
- **Knowledge of Library Weakness:** The attacker needs to be aware that the library is vulnerable.
- **Application specific:** If the application uses `execHash` option attacker would have to convince a user to open a malicious URL.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was reported by `Nahiiko` and fixed by `jcubic`.
- The fix involved ensuring proper escaping of double quotes within user input.
- A workaround was provided: `$.terminal.new_formatter([/([\s\S]+)/g, '[[;;]$1]']);` which forces all input to go through the formatting code that escapes the quotes.
