## Descriptions

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Active Choices Plugin

**SECURITY-2219
/
CVE-2021-21699**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`uno-choice`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/uno-choice)**

**Description:**

Active Choices Plugin 2.5.6 and earlier does not escape the parameter name of reactive parameters and dynamic reference parameters.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.

Active Choices Plugin 2.5.7 escapes references to parameter names.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Scriptler Plugin

**SECURITY-2406
/
CVE-2021-21700**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`scriptler`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/scriptler)**

**Description:**

Scriptler Plugin 3.3 and earlier does not escape the name of scripts on the UI when asking to confirm their deletion.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to create Scriptler scripts.

Scriptler Plugin 3.4 escapes the name of scripts on the UI when asking to confirm their deletion.

### XXE vulnerability in Performance Plugin

**SECURITY-2394
/
CVE-2021-21701**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`performance`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/performance)**

**Description:**

Performance Plugin 3.20 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers able to control workspace contents to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML report file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### XXE vulnerability in pom2config Plugin

**SECURITY-2415
/
CVE-2021-43576**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`pom2config`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pom2config)**

**Description:**

pom2config Plugin 1.2 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read and Item/Read permissions to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### XXE vulnerability in OWASP Dependency-Check Plugin

**SECURITY-2488
/
CVE-2021-43577**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`dependency-check-jenkins-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/dependency-check-jenkins-plugin)**

**Description:**

OWASP Dependency-Check Plugin 5.1.1 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers able to control workspace contents to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Agent-to-controller security bypass in Squash TM Publisher (Squash4Jenkins) Plugin allows writing arbitrary files

**SECURITY-2525
/
CVE-2021-43578**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`squashtm-publisher`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/squashtm-publisher)**

**Description:**

Squash TM Publisher (Squash4Jenkins) Plugin 1.0.0 and earlier implements an agent-to-controller message that does not implement any validation of its input.

This allows attackers able to control agent processes to replace arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system with an attacker-controlled JSON string.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
