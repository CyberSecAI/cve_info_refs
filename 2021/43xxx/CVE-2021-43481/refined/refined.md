Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43481:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a blind SQL injection in the `editapprovaltemplate.php` file of the webTareas application.
- User-supplied input, specifically the "condition" for an approval template, is not properly sanitized and is directly incorporated into a SQL query.
- The application attempts to blacklist dangerous SQL keywords, but this is insufficient to prevent exploitation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application does not display the results of the SQL query, making it a blind SQL injection.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application relies on a blacklist approach to filtering SQL keywords, which is easily bypassed.
- **Direct SQL Query Construction:** The application directly concatenates user-provided input into a SQL query without proper parameterization or escaping.
- **Time-Based Injection:** The exploit uses `SLEEP()` function to determine the truth of conditions within the SQL query, enabling the attacker to extract data character by character.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Extraction:** An attacker can extract arbitrary data from the database, including sensitive information like user credentials (login names and password hashes).
- **Privilege Escalation:** By extracting session tokens stored in the database, an attacker can impersonate other users, potentially gaining administrative privileges.
- **Complete database compromise**: With the ability to run SQL queries, attacker can extract any data they wish to from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is accessible through the web interface of the webTareas application, specifically the "approval template" creation feature in `/approvals/editapprovaltemplate.php`.
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is executed by sending specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable URL, which contain malicious SQL code within the "uq" parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have an authenticated session within the webTareas application.
- **Knowledge of the Application's Functionality:** The attacker needs to be aware of the "approval template" feature and how it interacts with the database.
- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs knowledge of blind SQL injection techniques, specifically time-based injection using the `SLEEP()` function.
- **Ability to send HTTP Requests**: Attackers need to be able to send HTTP requests, either through the use of tools like curl or python libraries.

**Additional Information:**

- The provided text includes a script that automates the blind SQL injection to extract login names and password hashes, as well as session tokens.
- The application uses MD5 hashes for passwords, which while not plain text, are weak and can be cracked.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 2.4p4 of webTareas.
