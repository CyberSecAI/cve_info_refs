Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43519:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Lua handles recursive coroutines when `pcall` is involved. Specifically, when a coroutine's first action within a `pcall` results in an error, the `nCcalls` counter (which tracks the C stack depth) is reset incorrectly. This prevents the C stack overflow protection mechanism from working.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Incorrect `nCcalls` handling:** The `nCcalls` counter, used to prevent C stack overflows, is incorrectly reset when an error occurs within a `pcall` in a coroutine, specifically during `lua_resume`. This prevents proper stack overflow protection during recursive coroutine calls.
-   **Missing C stack overflow check:** Due to the incorrect reset, the C stack overflow check, which depends on the `nCcalls` value, is bypassed.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A crafted Lua script can exploit this vulnerability to cause a C stack overflow, leading to a segmentation fault and crashing the Lua interpreter.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Crafted Lua script:** An attacker can craft a Lua script that uses recursive coroutines and `pcall` in a specific way to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Ability to execute Lua code:** An attacker needs to be able to execute Lua code on a vulnerable system.

The provided content offers a deeper dive into the technical root cause including:
    * Specific code examples illustrating the crash
    * Detailed explanation of the execution flow including affected functions like `lua_resume`, `luaD_rawrunprotected`, `lua_pcallk`, `luaD_call`, `luaD_precall`, `luaD_tryfuncTM` and `precover`.
    *  Analysis of the `nCcalls` counter and how it gets reset unexpectedly
    *  Address Sanitizer report showing a stack overflow
    *  A proposed patch to fix the vulnerability in the `lua_resume` function.

The content also includes the fix implemented in Lua 5.4.4 that addresses this vulnerability by correctly incrementing the `nCcalls` counter when entering the `lua_resume` function, ensuring that the C stack overflow is properly detected.
