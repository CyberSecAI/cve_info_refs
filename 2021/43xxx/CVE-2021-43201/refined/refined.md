The provided content is related to CVE-2021-43201.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A newly created project could inherit settings from a previously deleted project in JetBrains TeamCity.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Insufficient permission checks in the project creation process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A newly created project may inherit configurations, potentially leading to unintended access or modification based on the old project's configurations, which might include sensitive information or access controls. This could lead to information disclosure, privilege escalation, or other security issues depending on the inherited configurations.

**Attack vectors:**
A malicious actor could create a new project after another project with specific configurations has been deleted and the system fails to correctly isolate the new project, causing it to inherit configurations from the deleted project.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have the ability to create projects within the TeamCity instance. No other specific access or special privileges are described to be needed beyond the capacity to create new projects.
