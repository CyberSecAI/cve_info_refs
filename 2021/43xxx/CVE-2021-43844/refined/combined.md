# Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere in MSEdgeRedirect

High

[rcmaehl](/rcmaehl)

GHSA-95v4-748v-fmf9
Dec 19, 2021

## Package

MSEdgeRedirect
(AutoIt)

## Affected versions

< 0.5.0.1

## Patched versions

0.5.0.1

## Description

### Impact

MSEdgeRedirect versions before 0.5.01 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via specifically crafted URLs. This vulnerability requires user interaction and the acceptance of a prompt similar to the one below:

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/716581/146669983-d9db7046-24b5-4c55-b91f-0100ce13639e.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/716581/146669983-d9db7046-24b5-4c55-b91f-0100ce13639e.png)

With how MSEdgeRedirect is coded, parameters are impossible to pass to any launched file. However, there are two possible scenarios in which an attacker can do more than a minor annoyance:

**Scenario 1 (CVSS 7.5) - Confirmed:**

1. A user visits an attacker controlled webpage
2. The user is prompted with, and downloads, an executable payload
3. The user is prompted with, and accepts, the aforementioned crafted URL prompt
4. RCE executes the payload the user previously downloaded, if the download path is successfully guessed

**Scenario 2 (CVSS 8.8) - Not Yet Confirmed:**

1. A user visits an attacked controlled webpage
2. The user is prompted with, and accepts, the aforementioned crafted URL prompt
3. A payload on a remote, attacker controlled, SMB server is executed

The issue was found in the \_DecodeAndRun() function, in which I incorrectly assumed \_WinAPI\_UrlIs() would only accept web resources. Unfortunately, file:/// passes the default \_WinAPI\_UrlIs check(). File paths are now directly checked for and must fail. Future lockdown to URLs are planned in upcoming versions:

* Additional checks for indicators of non-HTTP/HTTPs URLs will be added to the \_IsSafeURL() function
* Any URLs will be passed directly to the default browser instead of allowing Windows to resolve the URL using \_GetDefaultBrowser()

**There is no currently known exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild.**

### Patches

A patched version, 0.5.0.1 has been released that checks for and denies these crafted URLs.

### Workarounds

There are no workarounds for this issue. Users are advised not to accept any unexpected prompts from web pages.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
