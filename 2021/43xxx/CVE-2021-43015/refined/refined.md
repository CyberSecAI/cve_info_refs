Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-43015:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer (CWE-788)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability arises from accessing a memory location beyond the end of a buffer. This typically happens when software reads or writes past the allocated memory boundary for a data structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution. This means an attacker could potentially run malicious code on the affected system, gaining control or causing other damage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
*   The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), meaning a user needs to perform some action like opening a malicious file, which could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be local to the system and needs to trick the user to trigger the vulnerability. The exploit does not require any privilege (PR:N).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as critical with a CVSS base score of 7.8.
*   The vulnerability affects Adobe InCopy versions 16.4 and earlier on Windows and macOS.
*   The vulnerability was reported by (yjdfy) CQY of Topsec Alpha Team.
