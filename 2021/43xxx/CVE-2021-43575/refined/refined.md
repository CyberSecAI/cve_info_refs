The provided content is related to **CVE-2021-36799**, not CVE-2021-43575. Therefore, it is **UNRELATED** to the specified CVE. However, as it does contain useful vulnerability information, I will proceed with extraction based on the linked CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The ETS5 software uses a hard-coded password (`ETS5Password`) and salt (`Ivan Medvedev`) to encrypt sensitive project information, instead of using the project password to derive the encryption key.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hard-coded cryptographic secrets (CWE-798, CWE-321): The use of a constant password and salt for encryption makes the encryption easily reversible.
- Inadequate encryption: Sensitive information is not properly encrypted.
- Lack of confidentiality for stored project data: Project files are stored in a location accessible to all user accounts without requiring administrator privileges, and the sensitive data within those files is not properly protected.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Disclosure of sensitive information: Attackers can decrypt project passwords, FDSKs, backbone keys, device authentication codes, device management passwords, user/tunneling passwords, and tool keys.
- Full compromise of KNX installations: With access to the decrypted information, attackers can eavesdrop on, impersonate, and reconfigure KNX devices, thus compromising the entire system's security.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access to the file system: An attacker can gain access to the project store located in `C:\ProgramData\KNX\ETS5\ProjectStore` and decrypt the sensitive information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the file system: The attacker needs access to the computer where the ETS5 software is installed, specifically the project store directory.
- No special privileges: The project files are readable by any user account on the computer, so no administrator or elevated rights are required.
