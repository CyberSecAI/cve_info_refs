The provided content is related to CVE-2021-43420.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization of user input, specifically the `username` parameter in the login form. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the login form.
- Lack of input sanitization and escaping of the username parameter.
- PHPSESSID hijacking vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Authentication bypass, allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access to accounts.
- Complete control of affected user accounts.
- Session hijacking via PHPSSESSID, specifically targeting the admin account.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending malicious SQL payloads through the `username` parameter in the login form.
- Stealing PHP session cookies via session hijacking.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the login page of the vulnerable application.
- Knowledge of basic SQL injection techniques.
- Ability to intercept network traffic or compromise the system to capture session cookies.
