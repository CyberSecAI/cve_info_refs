# Assura Announces Discovery of Two Vulnerabilities in Quicklert for Digium Switchvox

**Posted:**
03.07.2022

Nick Berrie

**Posted in: [Resources](/resources) » [Case Study](https://www.assurainc.com/category/case-study/), [Cyber Heads-up](https://www.assurainc.com/category/cyber-heads-up/)**
## **TL;DR**

Today Assura is announcing the discovery of two new vulnerabilities in **Quicklert for Digium Switchvox**. Late in 2021, Assura’s Offensive Security Operations team conducted a penetration test that uncovered two critical severity vulnerabilities in **Quicklert for Digium Switchvox Version 10 Build 1043** resulting in two new CVEs, discussed in detail below.

The first vulnerability (CVE-2021-43969) is a blind SQL injection (SQLi) vulnerability that reveals the entirety of the Quicklert database, providing an attacker access to the rest of the web application, irrespective of the fact that portions are gated behind user authentication.

Using the blind SQLi attack specified above to bypass authentication to the web application, we then discovered an Arbitrary File Upload vulnerability (CVE-2021-43970) that resulted in remote code execution (RCE) and ultimately complete takeover of the server.

Assura conducted responsible disclosure to Quicklert and the vulnerabilities have since been patched in **Quicklert for Digium Switchvox Version 10 Build 1051**.

Assura urges all Quicklert for Digium Switchvox customers to update to Version 10 Build 1051 or higher.

## **CVE-2021-43969**

**Summary**

| **Name** | Quicklert for Digium Switchvox Version 10 Build 1043 – Blind SQL Injection with Out-of-Band Interaction (DNS) |
| --- | --- |
| **Product** | Quicklert for Digium Switchvox |
| **Affected Versions** | Version 10 Build <1051 |
| **State** | Public |
| **Release Date** | 2022-03-01 |

**Vulnerability**

| **Type** | SQL Injection |
| --- | --- |
| **Rule** | CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command (‘SQL Injection’) https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html |
| **Remote** | Yes |

| **CVSSv3 Base Score** | 10 (Critical Severity) |
| **Exploit Available** | No, but manually exploitable |
| **CVE ID(s)** | CVE-2021-43969 – https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-43969 |

**Description**

The ‘*uname’*parameter of the *login.jsp* page for “Quicklert for Digium Switchvox Version 10 **Build 1043**” is affected by both a blind SQL injection with out-of-band interaction and a time-based SQL injection. The exploitation of this vulnerability requires no prior authentication and results in the complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the underlying SQL database.

**Proof-of-Concept**

1. We first escaped the value entered in the *‘uname’* parameter on the *login.jsp* page to inject code which called back to a DNS server under our control (Burp Collaborator in this case) utilizing the MSSQL function “master.xp\_dirtree”, which lists directory contents by default. The DNS server will not be found in a local directory and will result in the server making a request to our DNS server in an attempt to find that address for the master.xp\_dirtree function. **Note:** If you attempt to recreate this exploit, you will need to URL encode the SQL statements as seen in the screenshots below.

   ![](https://www.assurainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-06-at-11.47.52-AM.png)

   ![](https://www.assurainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image1.jpeg)
2. After validating that we were receiving DNS requests from the vulnerable server, it was possible to continue using the “master.xp\_dirtree” function to exfiltrate data from the server including the database name, admin username, etc., by altering the above command slightly. See the example below where we retrieved the DB\_NAME value by adding that additional argument:

   ![](https://www.assurainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-06-at-12.27.43-PM.png)

   ![](https://www.assurainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image2.webp)

   *Figure 2: Obtain DB\_NAME value via Out of Band SQL Injection with DNS Interaction to Burp Collaborator*We can see that the DB\_NAME value for Quicklert (‘NIPA’ by default) is prepended to the DNS query that we received in the Burp Collaborator tool:
   ![](https://www.assurainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image3.jpeg)
   ***Figure 3: DB\_NAME value “NIPA” Prepended to DNS Request in Burp Collaborator***
3. We could have continued this process of retrieving data piece by piece from the database through Burp Suite but there is a limitation to the string size which can be retrieved through these types of DNS queries. This led us to utilize time-based SQL injections which use a SLEEP statement to determine when a value does or does not exist based on how long the server takes to respond to a query. This is easily automated using SQLmap.py by saving the Burp Suite request to a file and then using the following command:

   `Sqlmap.py -r yourSQLirequesthere.txt -p uname –risk 3 –level 3`

   Variations on that command to “dump” database table contents provided us with the usernames and passcodes of every user in the database resulting in access to the web application as a valid user.

**Exploit**

There is no pre-packaged exploit for this vulnerability at this time although it can be easily exploited manually as shown in the Proof-of-Concept section above.

**Mitigation**

Quicklert corrected the sanitization issue in the ‘uname’ parameter in Quicklert Version 10 Build 1051.

**Description**

The *‘audioFile’*parameter of the */quicklert/albumimages.jsp*web form in **Quicklert for Digium Switchvox Version 10 Build 1043** is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload. This vulnerability allows authenticated (low privilege) attackers to upload malicious files to the server which are then executed when called by the media viewer within the web application. The exploitation of this vulnerability resulted in a complete compromise to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the server and served as a jump point into the victim’s DMZ.

**Proof-of-Concept**

1. After being authenticated, we first navigated to the */quicklert/album.jsp*page, which allowed us to add a new media album to our test account. After creating the new album, we were then able to upload new media files via the */quicklert/albumimages.jsp*web form.

   ***Figure 5: Quicklert Album File Upload***
2. We then created a Java reverse shell utilizing *msfvenom*. This payload was saved as “reverse.mp3”
3. We then uploaded the reverse.mp3 file via */quicklert/albumimages.jps* while the interceptor functionality of Burp Suite proxy was running. This allowed us to capture the POST request and make the following modifications:
   1. We renamed the filename from “reverse.mp3” to “reverse.mp3;.jsp”. This ensures that the server recognizes the Java reverse shell as a valid JSP file while bypassing any file extension validations the web application had in place.
   2. Additionally, we added a small piece of the byte-stream from a valid mp3 file by “catting” the file and then pasting the results above the current payload in Burp Suite.

After making these modifications, we released the intercepted request to allow it to POST the payload to the server.

All of this is illustrated below.

4. After the file was posted on the server, we started a Meterpreter listener and then accessed the “reverse.mp3;.jsp” payload on the server. The server interpreted the Java file correctly and created a reverse connection back to us, ultimately resulting in a complete takeover of the server within the victim’s DMZ.

**Exploit**

There is no pre-packaged exploit for this vulnerability at this time although it can be easily exploited manually as shown in the Proof-of-Concept section above.

**Mitigation**

Quicklert added file-type validation to the i.Album feature within the application to prevent uploading of potentially malicious file types.
