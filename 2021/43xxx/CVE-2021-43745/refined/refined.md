{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application's setup process, specifically the `setupPage` function in `/src/routes/setup.js`, uses `windowService.createMainWindow()` instead of `windowService.createSetupWindow()` which leads to the application listening on 0.0.0.0:37840 and opening a new window when accessing the setup URL, creating a denial of service condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect window creation during setup process",
       "Application listens on a network interface without proper protection",
       "Unintended creation of multiple application windows via a setup URL"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) - the system is flooded with new windows being opened repeatedly which overloads the system resources and may lead to a crash. The issue arises during the initial setup of the application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Accessing the setup URL, e.g., `http://ip:37840/setup`",
     "Direct access via the local network."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be on the same network or have access to the machine on which the application is running. No authentication required."
