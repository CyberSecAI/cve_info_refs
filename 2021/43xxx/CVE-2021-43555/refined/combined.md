ICS Advisory
# mySCADA myDESIGNER

Last RevisedNovember 10, 2021
Alert CodeICSA-21-313-04

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v3 7.3**
* **ATTENTION:** Low attack complexity
* **Vendor:** mySCADA
* **Equipment:** myDESIGNER
* **Vulnerability:** Relative Path Traversal

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for remote code execution.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of mySCADA myDESIGNER project creation software are affected:

* myDESIGNER: Versions 8.20.0 and prior

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 3.2.1    [RELATIVE PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-23](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html)

The affected product fails to properly validate contents of an imported project file, which may make the product vulnerable to a path traversal payload. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to plant files on the file system in arbitrary locations or overwrite existing files, resulting in remote code execution.

[CVE-2021-43555](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-43555) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H)).

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Energy, Food and Agriculture, Transportation Systems, Water and Wastewater Systems
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** Czech Republic

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Michael Heinzl reported this vulnerability to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

mySCADA recommends users apply update [v8.22.0 or later](https://www.myscada.org/version-8-22-0-released-security-update/).

**Upgrade note:** RFID card access has been redesigned. If a user uses an RFID card to login, the user will need to re-enter the password for all RFID users in the project after the update is applied.

CISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014) for more information on social engineering attacks.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
