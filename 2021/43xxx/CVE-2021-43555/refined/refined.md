Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43555:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the contents of an imported project file within the mySCADA myDESIGNER software. Specifically, the software fails to properly sanitize the file paths in the project file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Relative Path Traversal (CWE-23):** The software is vulnerable to a relative path traversal attack due to the lack of proper input validation on file paths within project files. This allows an attacker to specify file paths that reach locations outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By exploiting the path traversal vulnerability, an attacker can plant malicious files on the file system in arbitrary locations or overwrite existing files. This allows for the potential of remote code execution on the affected system.
- **File Overwrite:** Malicious project files can overwrite existing files on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Project File:** An attacker crafts a malicious project file containing path traversal payloads.
- **Import Functionality:** The crafted file is imported into the mySCADA myDESIGNER software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into importing the malicious project file into the affected myDESIGNER software. The advisory mentions social engineering attacks as a way this might occur.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim because the file can be delivered via email or other means.
- No network access is required by the attacker to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
- The vulnerability affects myDESIGNER versions 8.20.0 and prior.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 with a vector string of (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H), which means Local attack vector, Low attack complexity, No privileges required, User Interaction is required, Unchanged Scope, Low Confidentiality impact, High Integrity Impact, and High Availability impact.
- The affected software is used in critical infrastructure sectors: Energy, Food and Agriculture, Transportation Systems, Water and Wastewater Systems, making this a high priority vulnerability to fix.
- There are no known public exploits specifically targeting this vulnerability.
- The vendor has released an update to fix the vulnerability.
