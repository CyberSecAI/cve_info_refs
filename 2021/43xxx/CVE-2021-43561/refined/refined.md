Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **CVE ID:** CVE-2021-43561
* **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The extension "Google for Jobs" fails to properly encode user input before displaying it in an HTML context. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the usage of `f:format.raw` in the Fluid template partial `Job/Properties.html`. This allows for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code when user-supplied data is rendered.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application, which will be executed in the context of other users' browsers. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement of the web page, or redirection to malicious websites.
* **Attack Vectors:** The attacker needs to have a TYPO3 backend user account with permissions to input data that is processed by the vulnerable code of the extension.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be an authenticated TYPO3 backend user. They need the ability to input data that is then rendered in the affected template partial. The user must also be able to add content that will be rendered on a page that the user visits
