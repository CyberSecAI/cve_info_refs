# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| In production it's possible to see:  ``` TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'reply')     at defaultErrorFormatter (/app/node_modules/mercurius/lib/errors.js:67:19)     at Object.<anonymous> (/app/node_modules/mercurius/lib/routes.js:139:40)     at handleError (/app/node_modules/fastify/lib/reply.js:555:20)     at onErrorHook (/app/node_modules/fastify/lib/reply.js:524:5)     at _Reply.Reply.send (/app/node_modules/fastify/lib/reply.js:128:5)     at done (/app/node_modules/fastify/lib/contentTypeParser.js:167:13)     at Parser.defaultJsonParser [as fn] (/app/node_modules/fastify/lib/contentTypeParser.js:262:14)     at IncomingMessage.onEnd (/app/node_modules/fastify/lib/contentTypeParser.js:243:27)     at AsyncResource.runInAsyncScope (node:async_hooks:199:9)     at IncomingMessage.emit (node:events:402:35)  ```  This can happen if an error is thrown in a hook. We should be adding back the check for Context in the error handler.  *Originally posted by [@SimenB](https://github.com/SimenB) in [#653 (comment)](https://github.com/mercurius-js/mercurius/pull/653#discussion_r760304267)* |
