The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in the Kaseya Unitrends Backup Appliance, but only CVE-2021-43035 and CVE-2021-43040 are described in detail. CVE-2021-43042 is not mentioned. Therefore, only information regarding CVE-2021-43035 and CVE-2021-43040 are extracted.

**CVE-2021-43035: Unauthenticated SQL Injection in config.php**

*   **Root cause:** A blind SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/grid/config/config.php` script. The `host` parameter of a request is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Unauthenticated access to the vulnerable script.
    *   Direct injection of user-supplied data into SQL queries.
    *   Execution of the injected SQL statements under the `postgres` superuser account.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote code execution as the `postgres` user on the Linux system via a malicious UDF.
    *   Full control of the database server.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request with a malicious SQL payload in the `host` parameter.
*   **Attacker capabilities:**
    *   Network access to the Unitrends Backup Appliance.
    *   Ability to send HTTP requests.

**CVE-2021-43040: Unauthenticated SQL Injection in vaultServer**

*   **Root cause:** A blind SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/cgi-bin/vaultServer` endpoint. The `name` parameter, when calling the `replication-state` function, is directly injected into an SQL query without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Unauthenticated access to the vulnerable endpoint.
    *   Direct injection of user-supplied data into SQL queries.
    *   Execution of the injected SQL statements under the `postgres` superuser account.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote code execution as the `postgres` user on the Linux system using the same UDF payload as CVE-2021-43035.
    *   Full control of the database server.
*  **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/cgi-bin/vaultServer` endpoint with a malicious SQL payload in the `name` parameter when calling the `replication-state` function.
*   **Attacker capabilities:**
    *   Network access to the Unitrends Backup Appliance.
    *   Ability to send HTTP requests.

**Note:** Both vulnerabilities leverage the same underlying flaw of using `sprintf` to insert the parameters into the SQL query, without sanitization, and are executed as the `postgres` superuser, allowing for the creation of a malicious UDF to achieve remote code execution.
