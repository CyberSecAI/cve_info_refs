{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "SQL injection to bypass login, combined with unrestricted file upload to achieve remote code execution.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Unrestricted file upload",
    "Remote Code Execution"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Complete compromise of the server, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.",
  "Attack vectors": "Web application interface. The attacker performs SQL injection, creates a user and uploads a php webshell as an image which can then be accessed to run shell commands",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application and have knowledge of how to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability. No special privileges are required on the target system."
