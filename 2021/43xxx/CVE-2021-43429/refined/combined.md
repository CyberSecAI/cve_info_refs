| Thanks [@johnbent](https://github.com/johnbent) for looping me in.  Similar condition is described as a weakness here -> <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/401.html>  Since memory lock is not released in specific condition, It leads to not sufficiently tracking and releasing allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.  It impacts availability (reduced performance, article also mention, potential DoS attack).  Hi [@nileshgovande](https://github.com/nileshgovande)  I see that the specific condition is now fixed with pool->lock released with pthread\_mutex\_unlock(&pool->lock); Also code to reset \*handle and free items in the free list does clean-up.  However do we need to also add a similar code, in  if (handle == NULL) { return S3\_MEMPOOL\_INVALID\_ARG; }  Or will it not have pool-lock if handle is NULL ?  Regards Swanand |

| Hi [@anson-lo](https://github.com/anson-lo)  To further investigate, I went thru following linkes to check the details required to create CVE  <https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/report/>  Along with some other details, it asks for  How does an attacker exploit this vulnerability? (Explain access or other conditions necessary to attack.) What does an attacker gain by exploiting this vulnerability? (i.e. what is the impact?)  Also I wanted to check about the tool you mentioned you are using  Perhaps we can quickly connect so that I can understand the work you are doing?  Let me know.  Regards Swanand |

| [@swanand-gadre](https://github.com/swanand-gadre) Thanks so much!  **How does an attacker exploit this vulnerability?** This is my understanding after eyeballing the code for a while. In the `mempool_destroy`, the lock `pool->lock` is not released correctly when `*handle == NULL` and the function `mempool_destroy` returns `S3_MEMPOOL_INVALID_ARG`. When `mempool_create_with_shared_mem` that invokes `mempool_destroy` is called multiple times, it could lead to reacquiring the same lock `pool->lock`. Apologies for being unfamiliar with the code, this is my initial analysis, which could be refined further.  **What does an attacker gain by exploiting this vulnerability?** This could lead to deadlock, wreaking a denial-of-the-service due to the reacquiring the same lock.  **The tool I am working** This is a (academic purpose) static analysis tool that consists of pointer analysis, lock analysis, reachability analysis, etc. The tool is similar to [SVF](https://github.com/SVF-tools/SVF). |

| Hi [@anson-lo](https://github.com/anson-lo)  In my opinion, since your tool uncovered it, it is appropriate you raise request for CVE ID. Typically, committee would reach out to the products, in case of doubts/queries.  However requesting you to take initial step.  Also I wanted to know your feedback, if , the same fix applies to?  if (handle == NULL) { return S3\_MEMPOOL\_INVALID\_ARG; }  Regards Swanand |

| [@swanand-gadre](https://github.com/swanand-gadre) Thanks, I would take an initial step.     [cortx-s3server/mempool/s3\_memory\_pool.c](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-s3server/blob/d684426013aecda8b21d59e2fcc09073730f3fd2/mempool/s3_memory_pool.c#L529-L540)  Lines 529 to 540 in [d684426](/Seagate/cortx-s3server/commit/d684426013aecda8b21d59e2fcc09073730f3fd2)   |  | if (handle == NULL) { | | --- | --- | |  | return S3\_MEMPOOL\_INVALID\_ARG; | |  | } | |  |  | |  | pool = (struct mempool \*)\*handle; | |  | if (pool == NULL) { | |  | return S3\_MEMPOOL\_INVALID\_ARG; | |  | } | |  |  | |  | if ((pool->flags & ENABLE\_LOCKING) != 0) { | |  | pthread\_mutex\_lock(&pool->lock); | |  | } |      From my view, applying to `handle==NULL` is not necessary, since the lock `pool->lock` is acquired later. |
