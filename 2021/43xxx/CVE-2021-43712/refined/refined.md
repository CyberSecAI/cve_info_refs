Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43712:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "Add New Employee" form within the Employee Daily Task Management System. Specifically, the "Name" field does not sanitize user-provided input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Name" field. The injected script is then stored in the database and executed when other users view the employee information or navigate to management fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution within the context of the user's browser, which can include actions such as:
    - Data theft (session cookies, personal information, etc.).
    - Account takeover.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Modifying the user interface.
    - Other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Add New Employee" form in the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to access the administrative or manager functionalities to use the add employee form.
- The malicious payload is submitted through the "Name" field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires administrative or manager level access to the vulnerable application to access the "Add New Employee" functionality.
- The attacker does not need to be in the same network as the target since the vulnerability is based on a web application.
