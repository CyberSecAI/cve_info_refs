  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The 'servername' parameter in the Rumble Mail Server settings is vulnerable to stored XSS.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application. When other users access the server settings page, the attacker's JavaScript code will execute in their browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/settings:save` endpoint with a malicious JavaScript payload within the `servername` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to the application with administrative credentials to access the settings page."
