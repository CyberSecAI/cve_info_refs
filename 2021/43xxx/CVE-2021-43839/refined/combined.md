# Drainage of FeeCollector's Block Transaction Fees

High

[tomtau](/tomtau)
published
GHSA-f854-hpxv-cw9r
Dec 21, 2021

## Package

gomod

github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<=0.6.4

## Patched versions

0.6.5

gomod

github.com/tharsis/ethermint
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

<=0.9.0

0.7.3, 0.10.0

gomod

([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

<=0.4.2

None

## Description

### Impact

In Cronos nodes running versions before v0.6.5, it is possible to take transaction fees from Cosmos SDK's FeeCollector for the current block by sending a custom crafted MsgEthereumTx.

User funds and balances are safe.

### Patches

This problem has been patched in Cronos v0.6.5 on the mempool level.

The next network upgrade with consensus-breaking changes will patch it on the consensus level.

### Workarounds

There are no tested workarounds. All validator node operators are recommended to upgrade to Cronos v0.6.5 at their earliest possible convenience.

### Credits

Thank you to [@zb3](https://github.com/zb3) for reporting this issue on [Cronos Immunefi Bug Bounty Program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/cronos/), to [@cyril-crypto](https://github.com/cyril-crypto) for reproducing the issue and to [@yihuang](https://github.com/yihuang) and [@thomas-nguy](https://github.com/thomas-nguy) for patching the issue on the CheckTx (mempool) and the DeliverTx (consensus) levels.
