Lychee is a free photo-management tool, which runs on your server or web-space. Installing is a matter of seconds. Upload, manage and share photos like from a native application. Lychee comes with everything you need and all your photos are stored securely. Read more on our [Website](https://LycheeOrg.github.io).

## Installation

To run Lychee, everything you need is a web-server with PHP 7.1 or later and a MySQL database. Follow the instructions to install Lychee on your server. [Installation »](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee-v3/wiki/Installation)

## How to use

You can use Lychee right after the installation. Here are some advanced features to get the most out of it.

### Settings

Sign in and click the gear in the top left corner to change your settings. If you want to edit them manually: MySQL details are stored in `data/config.php`. Other options and hidden settings are stored directly in the database. [Settings »](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee-v3/wiki/Settings)

### Update

Updating is as easy as it should be. [Update »](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee-v3/wiki/Update)

### Build

Lychee is ready to use, right out of the box. If you want to contribute and edit CSS or JS files, you need to rebuild Lychee. [Build »](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee-v3/wiki/Build)

### Keyboard Shortcuts

These shortcuts will help you to use Lychee even faster. [Keyboard Shortcuts »](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee-v3/wiki/Keyboard%20Shortcuts)

### Dropbox import

In order to use the Dropbox import from your server, you need a valid drop-ins app key from [their website](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create). Lychee will ask you for this key, the first time you try to use the import. Want to change your code? Take a look at [the settings](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee-v3/wiki/Settings) of Lychee.

### Twitter Cards

Lychee supports [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) and [Open Graph](http://opengraphprotocol.org) for shared images ([not albums](https://github.com/electerious/Lychee/issues/384)). In order to use Twitter Cards you need to request an approval for your domain. Simply share an image with Lychee, copy its link and paste it in [Twitters Card Validator](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/validation/validator).

### Imagick

Lychee uses [Imagick](https://www.imagemagick.org) when installed on your server. In this case you will benefit from a faster processing of your uploads, better looking thumbnails and intermediate sized images for small screen devices. You can disable the usage of [Imagick](https://www.imagemagick.org) in [the settings](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee-v3/wiki/Settings).

### Docker

Browse the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/) for various automated Lychee-Docker builds.
Various docker builds include :

* [LinuxServer.io build](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/lychee/)
* [ARMHF based Linuxserver.io build](https://hub.docker.com/r/lsioarmhf/lychee/)

### Plugins and Extensions

The plugin system of Lychee allows you to execute scripts when a certain action fires. Plugins are hooks, which are injected directly into Lychee. [Plugin documentation »](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee-v3/wiki/Plugins)

It's also possible to build extensions upon Lychee. The way to do so isn't documented and can change every time. We recommend using the plugin system, when possible.

Here's a list of all available Plugins and Extensions:

# Lychee: A Stunning and User-Friendly Photo Management System

Lychee is a free, open-source photo-management tool that runs on your server or web space. Installation is quick and easy, taking just seconds. With Lychee, you can upload, manage, and share your photos seamlessly, just like using a native application. It comes with all the essential features you need, ensuring your photos are stored securely. Read more on our [website](https://LycheeOrg.github.io).

For even more advanced features, consider the Supporter Edition (SE). The SE version offers additional functionality to enhance your experience. Learn more about the Supporter Edition and its benefits [here](https://lycheeorg.github.io/get-supporter-edition).

## Support the Team

We aim to maintain a free open-source photography library with high quality of code.

Being in control of our own data, our own pictures is something that we value above all.

Through [contributions, donations, and sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/LycheeOrg), you allow Lychee to thrive. Your donations directly support demo server costs, continuous enhancements, and most importantly bug fixes!

## Installation

There are three deployment options available. The simplest is **Docker deployment**, as all dependencies are already predefined and configured.

### Docker deployment

An official Docker image can be found at [LycheeOrg/Lychee-Docker](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee-Docker) or on Docker Hub as [lycheeorg/lychee](https://hub.docker.com/r/lycheeorg/lychee).

### File-based deployment

Copy the extracted Zip file from <https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee/releases> to your webserver

### Build from Source deployment

To run Lychee, everything you need is a web-server with PHP 8.3 or later and a database (MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL or SQLite). Follow the instructions to install Lychee on your server. This version of Lychee is built on the Laravel framework. To install:

1. Clone this repo to your server and set the web root to `lychee/public`
2. Run `composer install --no-dev` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm install` to install node dependencies
4. Run `npm run build` to build the front-end
5. Copy `.env.example` as `.env` and edit it to match your parameters
6. Generate your secret key with `php artisan key:generate`
7. Migrate your database with `php artisan migrate` to create a new database or migrate an existing Lychee installation to the latest framework.

See detailed instructions on the [Installation](https://lycheeorg.github.io/docs/installation.html) page of our documentation.

### Update

Updating is as easy as it should be. [Update »](https://lycheeorg.github.io/docs/update.html)

## Configuration

### Settings

Sign in and click the gear in the top left corner to change your settings. [Settings »](https://lycheeorg.github.io/docs/settings.html)

### Advanced Features

Lychee is ready to use straight after installation, but some features require a little more configuration.

## Documentation

### Keyboard Shortcuts

These shortcuts will help you to use Lychee even faster. [Keyboard Shortcuts »](https://lycheeorg.github.io/docs/keyboard.html)

### Dropbox import

In order to use the Dropbox import from your server, you need a valid drop-ins app key from [their website](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/saver). Lychee will ask you for this key, the first time you try to use the import. Want to change your code? Take a look at [the settings](https://lycheeorg.github.io/docs/settings.html) of Lychee.

### Twitter Cards

Lychee supports [Twitter Cards](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/overview/abouts-cards) and [Open Graph](http://opengraphprotocol.org) for shared images (not albums). In order to use Twitter Cards you need to request an approval for your domain. Simply share an image with Lychee, copy its link and paste it in [Twitter's Card Validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator).

### ImageMagick

Lychee uses [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org) when installed on your server. In this case you will benefit from a faster processing of your uploads, better looking thumbnails and intermediate sized images for small screen devices. You can disable the usage of [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org) in the [settings](https://lycheeorg.github.io/docs/settings.html).

### New Photos Email Notification

In order to use the new photos email notification you will need to have configured the **MAIL\_** variables in your .env to your mail provider & [setup cron](https://laravel.com/docs/scheduling#running-the-scheduler). Once that is complete you then toggle **Send new photos notification emails** in the [settings](https://lycheeorg.github.io/docs/settings.html). Your users will be able to opt-in to the email notifications by entering their email address in the **Notifications** setting in the sidebar. Photo notifications will be grouped and sent out once a week to the site admin, album owner & anyone who the album is shared with, if their email has been added. The admin or user who added the photo to an album, will not receive a email notification for the photos they added.

## Troubleshooting

Take a look at the [Documentation](https://lycheeorg.github.io/docs/), particularly the [FAQ](https://lycheeorg.github.io/docs/faq_troubleshooting.html) if you have problems. Discovered a bug? Please create an issue [here](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee/issues) on GitHub! You can also contact us directly on [gitter (login with your github account)](https://gitter.im/LycheeOrg/Lobby) or on [discord »](https://discord.gg/JMPvuRQcTf).

## Notice: `master` & `alpha` branches

As LycheeOrg is a very small team, we do not have many maintainers. Most of us have an active work/family life, and as a result, it is no longer possible for us to apply proper 4-eyes principle in the coding reviews.

In order to keep our high code quality, the following changes have been applied.

* `master` stays as a stable branch and contains 4-eyes peer-reviewed pull-requests.
* `alpha` contains the latest changes (i.e. the above mentionned PR) merged with minimal review.

With this change, we hope to strike a balance between decently paced development (on `alpha`) and maintaining a robust core (on `master`).

On Docker, `nightly`/`dev` continues to refer to the latest `master` commit.
The `alpha` tag is updated daily with the content of the associated branch.

That being said, if you like the gallery and would like to contribute, do not hesitate to open pull request. If you would like to see more functionalities added and help us push Lychee, [Join the team!](https://lycheeorg.github.io/docs/contributions.html#joining-the-team)

### v6.0.0

Released on Oct 26, 2024

#### Dropping Livewire for Vue3

When we released version 5, we did not realize how much of a mistake switching to Livewire was.
Lychee's front-end became slow and sluggish, plagued with issues.
Most of the time as a work around, we had to advise users to disable version 5 of the front-end
by setting the environment variable `LIVEWIRE_ENABLED=false`.

With this in mind, at the end of June we came to the conclusion that we needed to build a new front-end from scratch.
We decided to go with Vue3, as it is a more mature framework and has a lot of support. This marks the begining of the Lychee version 6.

For more context on those changes, see our blog posts:

* Jun 25, 2024 - [Livewire performances problems 📉](/LycheeOrg/LycheeOrg.github.io/blob/master/2024-06-25-performance-problems)
* Jun 29, 2024 - [The future of Lychee: what is coming next. 🚀](/LycheeOrg/LycheeOrg.github.io/blob/master/2024-06-29-future-of-lychee)
* Sep 24, 2024 - [About Lychee API documentation](/LycheeOrg/LycheeOrg.github.io/blob/master/2024-09-24-v6-scramble)

#### Introducing Lychee SE

For the past few years, Lychee has been developed by a [small group of people](https://lycheeorg.github.io/support/) who have been working on it in their free time. We are proud to offer this software for free and we will continue to do so. However with time our team has decreased to the point where maintaining Lychee has become a challenge. We have been thinking about ways to keep Lychee alive, to be able to keep providing support, and to add more features.

We have come to the conclusion that we need to add a sponsor tier system. We have extended Lychee with a new version called SE (Supporter Edition) which will be available for our GitHub supporters. This SE version comes with enhanced features and configurations, helping us fund ongoing improvements while offering a bit extra to our supporters. The free version of Lychee will continue to be available but with a more streamlined feature set.

We strongly encourage you to check the full comparison between the [free and supporter edition](https://lycheeorg.github.io/get-supporter-edition).

If you enjoy using Lychee, please consider [supporting us](https://github.com/sponsors/LycheeOrg).

Thank you for helping us keep Lychee alive and growing!

#### Important Docker Changes

If you are consuming Lychee via Docker, you will probably need to update your `docker-compose.yml` file.
In order solve the issue of temporary folders in the container, we added an extra volume `/lychee-tmp` which
by default with the updated `docker-compose.yml` will be mapped to `./lychee/tmp`, see [here](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee-Docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml).

This volume allows you to control the temporary folder and avoid the issue of running out of space in the container.

#### Changes

`SE` refers to functionalities that are aimed at the Supporter Edition.

* `new` #106 : have "Search" on all views by @ildyria.
* `fixes` #126 : Add (optional) lossless rotation by @ildyria.

  > Effectively, this is not lossless rotation, this is just no rotation for the original.
* `fixes` #226 `SE` : Add counters for total pictures and subalbums by @ildyria.
  > We added a statistic page, allowing the users to check how much space they are using
  > and the total number of pictures and album that are in the library.

* `fixes` #2168 : Universal Drag & Drop and Paste to upload no longer work when using Livewire by @ildyria.
  > When moving to version 5, this functionality was lost. We now re-introduce it.
* `fixes` #2194 : Change album cover picture creates a slide show of all the picture after the selected one by @ildyria.
  > Version 5 had this annoying re-rendering of the album when changing the cover picture which was completely messed up.

* `fixes` #2361 : Image selecting does not work on chrome + MacOS by @ildyria.
  > One of the main complaints of MacOs user was that CTRL was also opening the context menu.

### v5.1.1

Released on Jan 22, 2024

#### Thank you @qwerty287

It is with great regret that we see one of our core contributors leave for personal reasons.
Their critical mind was really appreciated and they will be sorely missed.
We wish them success in all their future endeavors.

#### Import From Dropbox

This functionality is back, you will need to add your token and authorize your app on dropbox.
See more here: <https://www.dropbox.com/developers/saver>

#### Redirection of legacy links

We now provide the possiblity to redirect when using old links such as `https://lychee.test/#albumID/photoID`.
To enable this add `LEGACY_V4_REDIRECT=true` in your `.env`.
Do note that this relies on a javascript hook and therefore page reload.
If you did not share any links that way, leave as is. Default value is `false`.

* nextcloud

You will need to register your app to those providers and get your client id and secret.

If you are using Lychee in a sub folder, specify the path after the tld here in the `APP_DIR` constant.
For example for `https://lychee.test/path/to/lychee`:

### v4.6.0

Released on Sep 04, 2022

#### IMPORTANT

Once the migration is applied, should you wish to rollback, you will need to reset your admin user otherwise it will not be possible to log as admin anymore.

#### Changes

* `new` #1453 : Provide an ASCII fallback for multibyte filenames
* `new` #1403 : Use Laravel Auth facade instead of home-brewed authentication layer
  > This change will prevent the rollback as the Admin now follows proper username - hashed password values in the database (previously was hashed username and hashed value).
* `fixes` #1472 : Fixes major bug with relation to Tag albums
* `fixes` #1495 : Solve minor bugs in the installation procedure

### v4.5.3

Released on Aug 07, 2022

#### IMPORTANT

* The internal representation of Albums changed with version 4.5.0.

  We strongly recommend that you **BACK UP YOUR DATABASE BEFORE UPDATING**.
* The folder structure changed for images; **please check the required directory permissions**.

  Read more [here »](https://lycheeorg.github.io/docs/#directory-permissions).

#### Changes

* `new` : New ID scheme. Albums and photos are migrated to a new ID scheme. Previously, albums and photos used time-based integer IDs. The new IDs are truly 144bit of randomness encoded in Base64 as a 24-character string; e.g., if your photo had the URL `https://my-domain.tld/r/16102925744307/16102927818284` before, it may have the URL `https://my-domain.tld/r/GTqZfSso3nPeCnTNW4ovisgC/jM6KkmlK7X0LtVas5MjrHtTO` after the migration. This means, **external links to your albums or photos will stop working.** However, we implemented a redirection service. You can enable/disable the re-direction service under `Settings` > `More` > `legacy_id_redirection`. This gives you time to migrate any external reference to the new IDs. We also generate a log entry every time the redirection service is used. This log contains the legacy and new ID as well as information where the request came from. This may help you with the migration of your external links.
* `new` : New folder structure for images:

  + Deep directory structure. Instead of all images of a certain kind residing in a single, flat directory (potentially containing thousands of files), we now have two additional two-letter directory levels under each kind (e.g., images are stored as `medium/ba/d0/9a28ec995ead4877dfa1befa2d3b.jpg`).
  + HiDPI (`@2x`) variants now reside in their own directories.
  + `big` has been renamed to `original`.

  Note that this only affects newly added photos; those added in the past are not moved to new locations. Also, see the note above about directory permissions.
* `new` : Refactoring of the internal architecture and the representation of albums. While this didn't add any major new features, a number of optimizations have been put in place to speed up various operations, e.g., on installations with many hundreds of albums. Because this requires a particularly complex database migration, those with existing installations should pay attention to the note above about backing up their database.
* `new` : Refactoring of error handling and reporting. This should result in more meaningful error messages both in the web front end and in the server logs (instead of the old cryptic "Server error or API not found" messages).
* `new` :Refactoring of the file handling during upload/import. Instead of using temporary files and (re-)reading them many times, we now rely on file streams. This not only speeds up processing during upload/import (by around 50% in our tests), but is also an important step towards future support for the use of AWS S3 as image storage.
* `new` : Addedfeatures in the web front end :

  + QR code added in the sharing menu.
  + GPX tracks can be added to albums for displaying together with photos on the map.
  + Drag/drop support added for albums and photos to facilitate more intuitive Move/Merge
* `new` : ZIP compression level can now be changed and the compression can be disabled.
* `new` : Support of Vietnamese language.

Released on Nov 23, 2021

* `fixes` #1059 : Add Cache busting.
* `new` #1049 / `fixes` #1011 : New Photos Email Notification
  > + Send an email when new photos were added to albums that have been shared.
  > + Use the laravel notification system to send via SMTP, `env` settings will need to be set up.
  > + It is set to send out emails once a week via cron, so the laravel cron job would need to be set up.
  > + Neither is required so if people don't want to set those up then it won't affect the operation of Lychee.
  > + Add admin setting to toggle the notification option, which enables a user level menu item to change their email. This is purely opt-in, so users can clear their email if they don't wish to receive the emails anymore.
  > + The email that gets sent out has been branded lychee, and will group the last week's worth of notifications and send them all out in one email to each user that has an email set up.

If set to 0, photos individually made public (rather than through an album) will be included in the results of a public search or in public tagged albums. Basically, they will no longer be treated as hidden (even though they still won't be findable through browsing; we could address that as well by making the Public smart album, well, public -- I welcome your input if we should, and if so, what to name the config variable to enabled that, other than public\_public wink).

  > Since XMP sidecars are now allowed, images with the same checksum will not get
  > updated metadata if the sidecar changes but the checksum remains the same. This
  > adds an optional flag to the `lychee:sync` command that forces existing images

* `new` #599 : Added method to get the full path of albums.
  > Specifically in the sharing screen, when albums are sometimes named the same

  > album you are actually sharing. This adds the ability to get the album's
  > "full path" and sends it down for the sharing settings.
* `fixes` #596 : Failing xmp file read results in fallback to native exif extraction.
  > If the EXIF succeeds but sidecar fails, it reverts falls into the catch.
* `new` #574 : Support of HEIC files and subsequently convert raw files (e.g. .NEF) into jpeg.
  > if a raw file is imported such as .nef, php-imagick will try to generate a thumbnail jpeg for it.
  > Note that the extension still needs to be added in your advanced settings.
  >
  > **Important:** Lychee was never meant to convert RAW files such as .nef, .cr2 .arw etc.
  > If you shoot RAW, it is to be able to change *exposure*, *dodge*&*burn*, *crop* etc. later in
  > a proper image processing software such as Lightroom, > Photoshop, Capture One, Luminar, Darktable …
  > otherwise you better shoot JPEG. Lychee does not intend to provide those functionality.
* `new` #594 : Add debug bar for `dev` install.
  > It is disabled by default, even in debug mode. To enable it, set `DEBUGBAR_ENABLED` to `true` in your `.env` file.
* `new` #579 : Ghostbuster command to clean up dead symlinks.
  > The ghostbuster command also parses the database and see if some symlinks are dead.
  > It will delete the photo from the database in such case.
  > As this behaviour can modify the database, we disable it by default.
* `new` #577 : Parse additional xmp sidecars files to update metadata.
  > This reads in XMP sidecar files (if they exist).
  > Thankfully, exiftool supports reading in sidecars, so we can use the same
  > technique we're using to read the files. We merge both file and sidecar metadata,
  > taking priority based on user settings (default to prefer image metadata)
* `fixes` #581 : Undefined property errors when migrating from 3.1.6.
  > The missing `license`, `lens` are now taken care off.
* `fixes` #565 : No Dropbox Import with Lychee 4.0.0.

  > we provide a RSS feed, available at the `/rss` address.
  > it will contains the last `rss_max_items` (default: 100) over the last `rss_recent_days` (default: 7) days.
* `fixes` #557 : report files not imported by sync.
  > When using the command `lychee:sync` if a file is not imported for some reason, the Log will contains more detailed information instead of just an error message.
* `fixes` #550 : Version 4.0.4 database is not updated.

  > + We add a check that if apache is being used, the rewrite module is enabled (avoid silly 404 error when redirected to `/install`).
* `new` #541 : Better support for SQLite
  > We create a file in `database/database.sqlite` to avoid issues in the case where some user decides to use this type of database without giving a path.
* `fixes` #539 : Invalid exif geolocation causes db error
  > We now check that the latitude is between -90 and 90 degrees, we also check that the longitude is between -180 and 180 degrees. Any other values are discarded.
* `fixes` #533 : Add LYCHEE\_UPLOADS\_URL to secure-headers.php
  > This allows the use allow images to be loaded from another server (CDN).
* `fixes` #529 : Footer linkable.
  > With the update to Laravel v7, the footer was not html html tags anymore. We fix this. This allows the use of links in the footer, for e.g. legal stuff in Germany.
