Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-43162:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a command injection flaw within the `runPackDiagnose` function. This function is located in the `/usr/lib/lua/luci/modules/diagnose.lua` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The `runPackDiagnose` function appears to be susceptible to command injection, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device. This could lead to a full compromise of the router, including data theft, malware installation, denial of service, and more.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exposed through the `/cgi-bin/luci/api/diagnose` endpoint, which is accessible via HTTP(S).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Post-Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability. This suggests that the attacker must have valid user credentials or a session on the router's management interface.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Devices:** Ruijie RG-EW series routers, specifically tested on RG-EW1200 and RG-EW1200G PRO models.
*   **Affected Firmware:** Routers running ReyeeOS versions up to 1.55.1915 / EW_3.0(1)B11P55 are vulnerable.

In summary, CVE-2021-43162 is a post-authenticated command injection vulnerability in the `runPackDiagnose` function of Ruijie RG-EW series routers, which could lead to remote code execution.
