{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the elFinder's file creation process, where the application fails to properly validate the file extension, allowing for the creation of files with a manipulated extension using a colon (:) in the file name.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper file extension validation",
      "Remote code execution vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can create a malicious PHP file (webshell) on the server, which can then be used to execute arbitrary code on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker crafts a specific URL to make a file with an manipulated file extension (e.g., `webshell.php:aaa`).",
      "The attacker sends a crafted URL to create a file with a malicious extension."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have access to the elFinder instance, usually exposed over the network, and is able to craft specific URLs that send commands to the elFinder instance.",
        "additional_details": "The issue can be exploited even if the configuration does not allow creation of .php files by manipulating the file name using a colon. The actual exploit involves three steps: First, creating a file with a manipulated extension, then open the directory to 'refresh' the file list, and then using the put command to insert malicious PHP code.
