# Insufficient patch for Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) to jsx-slack v4.5.1

Moderate

[yhatt](/yhatt)
published
GHSA-hp68-xhvj-x6j6
Dec 18, 2021

## Package

npm

jsx-slack
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<4.5.2

## Patched versions

4.5.2

## Description

We found the patch for [CVE-2021-43838](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-55xv-f85c-248q "CVE-2021-43838") in jsx-slack v4.5.1 is insufficient to save from Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack.

This vulnerability affects to jsx-slack v4.5.1 and earlier versions.

### Impact

If attacker can put a lot of JSX elements into `<blockquote>` tag *with including multibyte characters*, an internal regular expression for escaping characters may consume an excessive amount of computing resources.

```
/** @jsxImportSource jsx-slack */
import { Section } from 'jsx-slack'

console.log(
  <Section>
    <blockquote>
      {[...Array(40)].map(() => (
        <p>亜</p>
      ))}
    </blockquote>
  </Section>
)
```

v4.5.1 has released by passing the test against ASCII characters but missed the case of multibyte characters.

[GHSA-55xv-f85c-248q](https://github.com/yhatt/jsx-slack/security/advisories/GHSA-55xv-f85c-248q "GHSA-55xv-f85c-248q")

### Patches

jsx-slack v4.5.2 has updated regular expressions for escaping blockquote characters to prevent catastrophic backtracking. It is also including an updated test case to confirm rendering multiple tags in `<blockquote>` with multibyte characters.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in jsx-slack

Moderate

[yhatt](/yhatt)
published
GHSA-55xv-f85c-248q
Dec 17, 2021

## Package

npm

jsx-slack
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<4.5.2

## Patched versions

4.5.2

## Description

jsx-slack v4.5.1 and earlier versions are vulnerable to a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) attack.

### Impact

If attacker can put a lot of JSX elements into `<blockquote>` tag, an internal regular expression for escaping characters may consume an excessive amount of computing resources.

```
/** @jsxImportSource jsx-slack */
import { Section } from 'jsx-slack'

console.log(
  <Section>
    <blockquote>
      {[...Array(40)].map((_, i) => (
        <p>{i + 1}</p>
      ))}
    </blockquote>
  </Section>
)
```
### Patches

jsx-slack v4.5.2 has updated regular expressions to prevent catastrophic backtracking.

jsx-slack v4.5.1 also had patched a workaround. It has no problems to contents with ASCII characters, but *still vulnerable to contents with multibyte characters*. ([36e4a10](https://github.com/yhatt/jsx-slack/commit/36e4a10405e4c7745333e245fcc5029c02c7065d))

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
