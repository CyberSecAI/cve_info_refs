{
  "CVE-2021-43035": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `/grid/config/config.php` script, where the `host` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection. The injected SQL statements are executed with the privileges of the postgres superuser.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unauthenticated blind SQL Injection vulnerability",
      "Insufficient input sanitization",
       "Use of superuser account for database access"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain shell access to the Linux system as the postgres user. This can lead to full system compromise due to the postgres user's elevated privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/grid/config/config.php` endpoint with a malicious SQL payload injected into the `host` parameter.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the management interface of the Unitrends Backup appliance and the ability to send HTTP POST requests."
