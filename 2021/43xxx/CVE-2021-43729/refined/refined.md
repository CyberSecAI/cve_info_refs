Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-43729:

**CVE-2021-43729**

*   **Root Cause:** The Pix-Link Mini Router firmware fails to sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the wireless security key (password).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The provided input for the WiFi security key is not properly sanitized, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be stored in the device's configuration.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** When a user connects to the WiFi network using the crafted malicious password, the stored JavaScript payload is executed in the user's browser when the device's home page is visited. This can lead to arbitrary code execution within the user's browser, potentially allowing for session hijacking, defacement, or other client-side attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker needs to access the router's configuration interface, specifically the "Advance>Wireless" settings page. The attacker then needs to intercept the request sent when "Apply" changes to inject a malicious javascript payload into the security key field. Then, anyone who connects to the affected network, using the malicious security key will trigger the XSS.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the device's web management interface and modify the wireless security key. This likely requires either being on the same network as the device or having administrator access to the device. Additionally, the attacker would need to know or guess the device IP address.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The blog post also mentions a similar stored XSS vulnerability affecting the SSID field (CVE-2021-43728). Both vulnerabilities stem from the same lack of input sanitization.
*   The exploit requires intercepting and modifying the request sent to the router because there's a character limit on the input field.
