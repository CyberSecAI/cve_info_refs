Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-43856

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the application not properly handling non-image file uploads, specifically those that browsers can render inline. This allows malicious users to upload files containing JavaScript (e.g., XML files) that will execute when viewed directly in the browser, leading to a stored XSS attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious JavaScript code through file uploads.
- **Inadequate File Handling:** The application did not force download of unsafe file extensions, allowing browsers to render potentially malicious files inline.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers.
- This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities if the users opens the malicious file directly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious file with a non-image extension (e.g. an XML file with embedded JavaScript).
- **Direct File Access:** The victim directly accesses the uploaded file via the URL where it's stored on the server which causes the browser to render it inline, triggering the malicious JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  Must be able to upload files to the Wiki.js application.
- The attacker must know the URL to the uploaded file in order to construct a malicious link.
- The victim needs to be a user of the Wiki.js platform and needs to click on the malicious link.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was mitigated by adding an option to force download non-image files which is enabled by default, which prevents browsers from rendering unsafe files inline.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported by @Haxatron.
- The fix was introduced in commit `79bdd44` and included in version 2.5.264.
- The vulnerability is classified as "moderate" severity.
