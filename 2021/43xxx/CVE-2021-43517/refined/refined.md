Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2021-43517:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a backdoor embedded within the firmware of DVR/NVR devices manufactured by Xiongmai (Hangzhou Xiongmai Technology Co, XMtech) that are based on HiSilicon SoCs. The backdoor is located in the `dvrHelper` or `macGuarder` process, listening on TCP port 9530. This backdoor allows an attacker to enable telnet access with root privileges using a cryptographic challenge-response mechanism.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Backdoor:** The `dvrHelper` or `macGuarder` process contains a hidden functionality that allows for remote activation of telnet access.
*   **Weak authentication:** The authentication process is based on a symmetric cipher similar to 3DES-EDE2. However, the pre-shared key (PSK) used for the encryption is stored in plaintext within the firmware or a default key is used (`2wj9fsa2`).
*   **Static credentials:** Once telnet is enabled, the attacker can log in using a set of static login/password combinations that can be retrieved from the firmware.
*   **Insecure stack buffer:** The "CMD" payload is decrypted into a fixed 32-byte buffer on the stack, leading to potential stack overflow vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Full control of the device:** Successful exploitation provides a root shell on the device.
*   **Data exfiltration:** Attackers can access video and other data stored on the device.
*   **Device manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate device settings, disable recording or alter firmware.
*   **Network access:** Attackers can use compromised devices as a pivot point to further attack the network.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network access:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, specifically through TCP port 9530.
*   **Remote activation:** Attackers can remotely activate the telnet service using the described challenge-response mechanism.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the target device on port 9530.
*   **PSK knowledge:** The attacker needs the pre-shared key (PSK), which is either the default one or extracted from the device's firmware.
*   **Cipher implementation:** The attacker needs to implement the custom 3DES-like encryption algorithm to successfully authenticate with the device.

**Additional details:**

*   The article provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) code (available at: `https://github.com/Snawoot/hisilicon-dvr-telnet`) demonstrating the exploit.
*   The article also mentions a potential stack overflow vulnerability in the handling of the CMD command, although this is considered a secondary exploitation path.
*   The article confirms that the vulnerability affects devices using Xiongmai firmware, not directly HiSilicon.
