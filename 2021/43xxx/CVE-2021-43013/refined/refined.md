Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43013:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Access of memory location after end of buffer. This is caused by a buffer overflow or similar issue where the application attempts to access memory outside of the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds memory access (CWE-788) leading to a buffer overflow condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can potentially execute malicious code on the target system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs local access to the system.
- User interaction (UI:R) is required, as the user needs to open a crafted file for the exploit to trigger.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
