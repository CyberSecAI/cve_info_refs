The provided content is related to CVE-2021-43638.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an integer overflow vulnerability in the IOCTL handlers 0x22005B and 0x22001B of the `wspvuhub.sys` and `wspusbfilter.sys` drivers. These drivers are part of the Eltima SDK, which is used for USB over Ethernet functionality in various cloud services, including Amazon WorkSpaces.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** Insecure arithmetic operations on user-controlled data without overflow checks when calculating the copy size in the `memmove` function within the IOCTL handlers, leading to an integer overflow.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The IOCTL handlers use `METHOD_NEITHER` for data transfer, which means the kernel driver is responsible for validating, probing, locking, and mapping the user-supplied buffer. However, the code lacks proper validation, allowing attackers to pass arbitrary values for buffer size and copy size.
- **Unsecured IOCTL Access:** The driver accepts IOCTLs without access control list (ACL) enforcement, making it possible to trigger the vulnerability from sandboxed environments.
- **Double Fetches:** Potential for double fetches due to lack of input validation and using user-mode addresses directly in kernel mode

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows a user to escalate privileges and execute code in kernel mode.
- **Security Product Bypass:** The vulnerability can be used to bypass security products.
- **System Corruption:** Attackers can overwrite system components and corrupt the operating system.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The integer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution in the kernel mode.
- **Denial of Service:**  The vulnerability can be exploited to cause a Blue Screen of Death (BSoD).
- **Lateral Movement:** Attackers could use this vulnerability for lateral movement by pivoting to other systems in a network.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted IRPs (I/O Request Packets) with malicious parameters to the vulnerable device driver.
- Specifically, crafting an IRP with different parameters for allocation and copy functions, causing an overflow by making the copy size greater than the allocation size or through integer overflow during size calculations.
- The vulnerability can be triggered locally or potentially from a sandboxed environment.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send IOCTLs to the vulnerable device. This can be a local user on the system or a process running within a sandbox environment.
- The attacker needs to craft a specific input buffer with the appropriate size parameters to trigger the integer overflow.
