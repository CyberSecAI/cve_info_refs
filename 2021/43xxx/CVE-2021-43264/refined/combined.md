### Bug Description

Hello again! Mahara's help API blocks / characters but replaces the - with / in the `page` parameter (see <https://git.mahara.org/mahara/mahara/-/blob/master/htdocs/lib/mahara.php#L376>) and this allows unauthenticated path traversal. The thing that prevents this from being a really bad vulnerability is that the application appends a .html to the path so the files that can be leaked are quite limited. However, the export feature leaves potentially-private user data on disk... in .html format!

To reproduce, visit <http://localhost:6142/mahara/json/help.php?plugintype=core&pluginname=view&page=..-..-..-..-..-js-tinymce-plugins-mathslate-help>

It will show the contents of the tinymce plugin's help.html file that lives in the Mahara directory structure.

The vulnerable code mentioned above is in the `get\_helpfile\_location` function.

```php

    if ($page) {

        $pagebits = explode('-', $page);

        $file = array\_pop($pagebits) . '.html';

        if ($plugintype != 'core') {

            $subdir .= 'pages/' . join('/', $pagebits) . '/';

        }

        else {

            $subdir .= 'pages/' . $pluginname . '/' . join('/', $pagebits) . '/';

        }

    }

```

This "split on - and join with /" logic allows the path traversal. The final path should be checked to make sure it's still inside the help/ directory.

The real impact of this vulnerability comes from the fact that after using the export function (<http://localhost:6142/mahara/export/index.php>) the HTML data of a user remains on disk for a while.

```shell

root@692678e7a88b:/# find /mahara/data/ -name '\*.html'

/mahara/data/export/1/1632482909/export\_info/files/Cover images/index.html

```

Leaking it would require getting the unix timestamp in the path right but still not impossible if there's no rate-limiting in place. Getting to the base `/HTML/index.html` file would reveal the names of the other files they don't need to be guessed.

Suggested CVSS: AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N 3.7

For the security forum post:

Vulnerability type: Path traversal

Attack type: Local

Impact: Access escalation

Affected components: The help icon for 'page help'

Attack vectors: If a person alters the path to the page help file they can traverse to find other .html files outside the site's webroot and potentially find sensitive information.

Suggested description: In Mahara before 20.04.5, 20.10.3, 21.04.2, and 21.10.0, addjusting the path component for the page help file could cause seeing html files that you are not allowed to access.

To get to files outside the webroot

path.

## Create portfolios

Using Mahara, students and staff create their personal learning stories by uploading evidence of activities they have participated in, and embedding publicly accessible content they have previously put online. They can write reflections on their experiences that frame this evidence, map it to competencies or registration requirements, and provide necessary context.

Mahara can be used for many different portfolio purposes, such as study, professional development, work-integrated learning, assessment, showcase and presentation, and employability.

[Learn about the portfolio options](https://mahara.org/view/view.php?id=137010)

## Share work

Mahara allows portfolios to be shared flexibly with one person, a specific group of people, or the entire world. Access can be further restricted to a particular time frame or just within an assessment task.

## Engage with others

Mahara makes it easy to comment and give feedback. Portfolios can also be submitted to learning management systems via LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) for marking.

Groups in Mahara allow people to create portfolios collaboratively and engage in forum discussions.

Vulnerability type: Path traversal
Attack type: Local
Impact: Access escalation

Affected components: The help icon for 'page help'
Attack vectors: If a person alters the path to the page help file they can traverse to find other .html files outside the site's webroot and potentially find sensitive information.

Description: In Mahara before 20.04.5, 20.10.3, 21.04.2, and 21.10.0, addjusting the path component for the page help file could cause seeing html files that you are not allowed to access.
