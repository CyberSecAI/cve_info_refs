- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Subrion CMS allows an attacker to upload a malicious SVG file containing JavaScript code. This malicious SVG is then included in a page, causing the JavaScript to execute in the browser of any user viewing the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of SVG files uploaded through the admin interface.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Session cookies can be stolen.
    - Users can be redirected to phishing pages.
    - The browser of a user visiting the affected page can be controlled by the attacker.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - An attacker logs in as admin and uploads a malicious SVG file via the admin interface.
    - The attacker then includes the malicious SVG in a page.
    - When a user visits the created page, the embedded JavaScript in the SVG executes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs administrative access to the Subrion CMS instance.
