Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43836:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the `SymfonyExpressionTokenProvider` in Sulu handles the translator service within the expression language evaluation. Specifically, the translator object was directly passed to the expression language, allowing potentially dangerous methods like `addResource` to be called through the expression language.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Access to Translator Methods:** The `SymfonyExpressionTokenProvider` directly exposed the translator service to the expression language. This allowed an attacker to call methods like `addResource` on the translator object through the expression language.
*   **Potential for File Inclusion:** The `addResource` function in the translator can be used to include a file from the local file system.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** If a malicious php file is included using the vulnerability, this could result in remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker with a backend user account can read arbitrary local files on the server.
*   **Potential Remote Code Execution:** In a default configuration, exploiting the file include vulnerability can also lead to remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Expression Language Injection:** The attacker crafts a malicious expression string that includes a translator call to a dangerous method such as `addResource`, injecting this string into a part of the application that uses the expression language.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Backend User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account with access to the Sulu backend to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves wrapping the translator object in a `TranslatorWrapper` class before passing it to the expression language. This wrapper disables the `setLocale` function and prevents access to dangerous functions like `addResource`.
*   The provided commit diffs demonstrate the changes made to address the vulnerability, including adding the `TranslatorWrapper` class and modifying the `SymfonyExpressionTokenProvider` to use this wrapper.
*   The vulnerability is identified as a PHP file inclusion which, under default configurations, leads to remote code execution.
*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerability can be fixed by overwriting the service `sulu_route.generator.expression_token_provider` and wrapping the translator before passing it to the expression language as a workaround.
