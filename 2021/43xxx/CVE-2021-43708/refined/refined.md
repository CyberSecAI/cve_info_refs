{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Titus Data Classification Labelling tool can be bypassed by opening an excel file in safe mode, loading content, saving, and exiting. The tool does not apply classification labels when excel is opened in safe mode.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect permission/access control",
      "Lack of classification label application when Excel is opened in safe mode"
    ],
    "impact": "Information disclosure by bypassing data classification/labeling tools, which can lead to bypassing host-based and perimeter DLP tools. This allows sensitive data to be exfiltrated without proper classification.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local exploitation via command prompt"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "User-level privileges are sufficient to exploit this vulnerability. Attacker needs access to a local system with the vulnerable Titus Data Classification Labelling tool installed."

  "additional_information": {
    "version": "Titus â€” 18.8.1910.140",
    "attack_type": "Local",
    "method": "Control bypass",
        "steps": [
        "Open a command prompt",
        "Start Excel in safe mode using the command: 'excel /s <<Filename.xlsx>>'",
        "Load data/content into the excel file",
        "Save and close the file"
