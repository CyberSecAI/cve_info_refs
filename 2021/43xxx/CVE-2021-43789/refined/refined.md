Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-43789:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input in the search filters of PrestaShop. Specifically, the `orderBy` and `sortOrder` parameters are vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection. This means an attacker cannot directly see the results of the injected SQL query, but they can infer information based on the application's responses (e.g., timing differences, error messages, or changes in the returned data)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, read sensitive information, modify data, or even potentially take control of the server depending on database permissions.
- The impact is considered "High" severity

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the search filter functionality of the PrestaShop application.
- Attackers manipulate the `orderBy` and `sortOrder` parameters in a request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests with malicious values in the `orderBy` and `sortOrder` parameters to the PrestaShop application. It's likely they would need to have some level of access to the store's functionality, but it's not explicit if an account or specific privileges are required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in PrestaShop version 1.7.8.2.
- The vulnerability was identified and reported by PierreRambaud.
- The affected versions are >= 1.7.5.0.
