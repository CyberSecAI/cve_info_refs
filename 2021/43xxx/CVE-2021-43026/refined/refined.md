The provided content is related to CVE-2021-43026.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A buffer overflow vulnerability (CWE-788) exists due to improper bounds checking during memory access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vector is not detailed in this document. However, the vulnerability is triggered when accessing a memory location outside the bounds of a buffer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would likely need to provide a crafted input that triggers the out-of-bounds memory access. The attacker would need to have the ability to get the application to process the crafted input in order to trigger the vulnerability.
