  "vulnerability_information": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-43353",
    "description": "The Crisp Live Chat WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery due to missing nonce validation via the `crisp_plugin_settings_page` function found in the ~/crisp.php file, which made it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in versions up to, and including 0.31.",
     "root_cause": "The plugin's `crisp_plugin_settings_page` function lacks nonce validation, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into the plugin's settings, leading to XSS attacks.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker tricks a site administrator into performing an action (e.g. clicking a link) which initiates a forged request to modify the plugin settings.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and trick a site administrator into executing it."
