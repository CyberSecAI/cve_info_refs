Here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-43535, extracted from the provided content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A use-after-free condition occurs when an HTTP2 session object is released on a different thread than the one using it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free (UAF):**  The primary weakness is a use-after-free vulnerability. This happens when an object is freed (its memory is released), but a pointer to that memory is still held and later used, leading to undefined behavior.
*   **Thread Safety Issue:**  The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper synchronization and thread-safety when managing the lifecycle of HTTP2 session objects, specifically regarding object destruction across different threads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The use-after-free leads to memory corruption due to the access of freed memory.
*   **Potentially Exploitable Crash:** The memory corruption can cause the application to crash, and this crash could be potentially exploitable by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through network traffic using the HTTP/2 protocol. An attacker can potentially trigger the UAF by manipulating HTTP/2 connections.
*  Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered during the processing of data received via HTTP2 (`ReadSegment`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to influence network traffic to a vulnerable client using HTTP/2. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim.
*   The attacker needs to be able to trigger the sequence of operations that lead to the use-after-free of the `Http2Session` object on a different thread.

**Additional Details:**

*   The crash occurs in the `mozilla::net::Http2Stream::TransmitFrame` function, indicating a problem with sending HTTP/2 frames.
*   The issue was initially discovered on 32-bit Windows systems but is likely to be a problem across other platforms as well.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the `nsHttpTransaction::mConnection` is released on the socket thread and changing raw pointer access to a weak pointer.
*   The fix also adds diagnostic assertions to check if the `Http2Stream` holds a pointer to the expected session.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 93, Firefox ESR 91.3 and Thunderbird 91.3.
*   The bug was initially thought to be a duplicate of [bug 1402014](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1402014) but was later determined to be a separate issue after the initial fix did not resolve the crashes.
