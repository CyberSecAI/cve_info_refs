Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43682:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `exit` function in `AdminBaseController.class.php` which directly outputs the value of `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']` within a meta refresh tag. The `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']` value is user-controlled via the Host header and is not sanitized, leading to XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, caused by the lack of sanitization of the `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']` variable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the `HTTP_HOST` header. When the application uses this unsanitized input to construct a redirect meta tag, the injected script will execute in the victim's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Host header:**  An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request with a specially crafted `Host` header containing JavaScript code. When the application processes this request, the injected code will be reflected in the response, resulting in XSS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a manipulated Host header to the vulnerable application. No specific network position is required.
