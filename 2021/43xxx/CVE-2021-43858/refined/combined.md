## Highlights

* Click [here](https://min.io/download) to download the latest version of MinIO.
* Click [here](https://min.io/pricing) for production support.
* Similar to release [RELEASE.2021-11-24T23-19-33Z](https://github.com/minio/minio/releases/RELEASE.2021-11-24T23-19-33Z). **Downgrades are not supported in this release** for erasure-coded clusters, due to on-disk data format version bump - once upgraded erasure-coded clusters cannot be downgraded to the previous release. Please upgrade **staging** or **testing** environments first.
* Priviledge escalation issue fixed in this release refer to our security advisory on this vulnerability. All users are advised to upgrade if they are public facing deployment. [CVE-2021-43858](https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-j6jc-jqqc-p6cx)
* Healing of shards that do not have aligned padding issue are fixed automatically in two locations one in "healing" and another during a "GetObject()" call - refer [#13978](https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/13978), [#13945](https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/13945)
* Multi-pool setup should purge the dangling objects properly.

* fix: user privilege escalation bug by [@donatello](https://github.com/donatello) in [#13976](https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/13976)
* simplify logger time and avoid possible crashes by [@harshavardhana](https://github.com/harshavardhana) in [#13986](https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/13986)
* add healing for invalid shards by skipping the blocks by [@harshavardhana](https://github.com/harshavardhana) in [#13978](https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/13978)
* fix: healing across pools removing dangling objects by [@harshavardhana](https://github.com/harshavardhana) in [#13990](https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/13990)

### @donatello **[donatello](/donatello)** commented [Jul 19, 2019](#issue-470095186)

## Description

* Policy mapping is now at `config/iam/policydb/users/myuser1.json`

  and includes version.
* User identity file is now versioned.
* Migrate old data to the new format.

## Motivation and Context

This change is in preparation to add the user-groups feature to MinIO server, so that server admins can create and manage user groups.

In this change, the policy mapped to a user is being moved and on disk json files are being versioned.

Migration from old format to new in included in this change.

## How to test this PR?

Two things to test:

1. Start server on this PR, and check if users system works as before.
2. Start server on master, create some users. Then build this PR and start the server, and make sure users created on master are present in new version on this PR and works as expected.

## Types of changes

* Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
* New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
* Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)

## Checklist:

* Fixes a regression (If yes, please add `commit-id` or `PR #` here)
* Documentation needed
* Unit tests needed
* Functional tests needed (If yes, add [mint](https://github.com/minio/mint) PR # here: )

Sorry, something went wrong.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Fix user privilege escalation bug ([#13976](https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/13976))

```
The AddUser() API endpoint was accepting a policy field.
This API is used to update a user's secret key and account
status, and allows a regular user to update their own secret key.

The policy update is also applied though does not appear to
be used by any existing client-side functionality.

This fix changes the accepted request body type and removes
the ability to apply policy changes as that is possible via the
policy set API.

NOTE: Changing passwords can be disabled as a workaround
for this issue by adding an explicit "Deny" rule to disable the API
for users.

## Description

The user create API endpoint was accepting a policy field. This API is used to

update a user's secret key and account status, and allows a regular user to

update their own secret key. The policy update is also applied though does not

appear to be used by any existing client side functionality.

This fix changes the accepted request body type and removes the ability to apply

policy changes as that is possible via the policy set API.

## Motivation and Context

Found while reviewing code working on something else.

## How to test this PR?

Tests included.

## Types of changes

* Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
* New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
* Optimization (provides speedup with no functional changes)
* Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)

## Checklist:

* Fixes a regression (If yes, please add `commit-id` or `PR #` here)
* Documentation updated
* Unit tests added/updated

Sorry, something went wrong.

| The workaround may sound obvious for a seasoned MinIO developer but as an occasional user it is not exactly clear, even after looking at the documentation for a while.  Do I understand it correctly that the policy action key `admin:CreateUser` needs an explicit `Deny` set in policy for all users that I want to implement this workaround for, meaning for example a fragment added to existing policy for user `needsworkaround`:  ```     {       "Action": [         "admin:CreateUser"       ],       "Effect:" "Deny",       "Resource": [         "arn:aws:s3:::*"       ]     } ``` |

| [@bluikko](https://github.com/bluikko) you should upgrade and not worry about workarounds. Its been almost 2 weeks since its published [GHSA-j6jc-jqqc-p6cx](https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-j6jc-jqqc-p6cx "GHSA-j6jc-jqqc-p6cx")  I would consider it a waste of time while the release is available with a fix. |

Agreed, but it is not a simple matter to get this updated so I have a choice of deploying a workaround, doing nothing, or updating in a few months. |

# User privilege escalation in AddUser() admin API

High

[harshavardhana](/harshavardhana)
published
GHSA-j6jc-jqqc-p6cx
Dec 27, 2021

## Package

gomod

minio
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

RELEASE.2019-07-31T18-57-56Z

## Patched versions

RELEASE.2021-12-27T07-23-18Z

## Description

### Impact

AddUser() API endpoint was exposed to a legacy behavior.

i.e it accepts a "policy" field,

This API is mainly used to create a user or update a

user's password.

However, a malicious client can hand-craft an HTTP API call

that allows for updating Policy for a user and gaining

higher privileges.

* We have not seen any reports of this issue from our customers

  or community users. This was reproduced internally during a

  regular security audit.
* There are no known SDKs or client-side tools that expose this behavior.
* Prior knowledge of Admin API calls is needed to come up with an exploit

  and the user must have valid credentials to access the MinIO service.

### Patches

Fix changes the accepted request body type and removes the

ability to apply policy changes (legacy) behavior through this API.

Any policy changes are only allowed with the Policy 'set' API call.

```
commit 5a96cbbeaabd0a82b0fe881378e7c21c85091abf
Author: Aditya Manthramurthy <donatello@users.noreply.github.com>
Date:   Thu Dec 23 09:21:21 2021 -0800

    Fix user privilege escalation bug (#13976)

    The AddUser() API endpoint was accepting a policy field.
    This API is used to update a user's secret key and account
    status, and allows a regular user to update their own secret key.

    The policy update is also applied though does not appear to
    be used by any existing client-side functionality.

    This fix changes the accepted request body type and removes
    the ability to apply policy changes as that is possible via the
    policy set API.

    NOTE: Changing passwords can be disabled as a workaround
    for this issue by adding an explicit "Deny" rule to disable the API
    for users.

```

Users are advised to upgrade to [RELEASE.2021-12-27T07-23-18Z](https://github.com/minio/minio/releases/tag/RELEASE.2021-12-27T07-23-18Z)

### Workarounds

Changing passwords can be disabled as a workaround for this

issue by adding an explicit "Deny" rule to disable the API

for users.

### References

* Introduced during a refactor done here [#7949](https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/7949)
* Fixed by changing to match the expected behavior [#13976](https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/13976)
