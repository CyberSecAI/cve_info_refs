Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43858:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `AddUser()` API endpoint in MinIO was accepting a "policy" field in the request body, which was not intended. This API was designed for user creation and password updates but the vulnerability allowed for policy updates as well.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A regular user could craft a malicious HTTP API call to update their own policy, potentially gaining higher privileges than intended.
- **Incorrect API Behavior:** The `AddUser()` API was not behaving as expected, allowing policy updates which should have been done using the policy set API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

A malicious user could escalate their privileges within the MinIO system by updating their policy, leading to potential unauthorized access and manipulation of data and resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct API Call:** An attacker would need to craft a specific HTTP API call to the `AddUser()` endpoint, including a "policy" field in the request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Valid User Credentials:** The attacker must have valid credentials for accessing the MinIO service.
- **Knowledge of Admin API:** The attacker needs prior knowledge of MinIO's Admin API calls.
- **Ability to craft HTTP request:** Ability to manipulate the HTTP call to include the unintended 'policy' field.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was introduced during a refactor done in pull request #7949.
- The fix for this vulnerability was implemented in pull request #13976 by changing the accepted request body type and removing the ability to apply policy changes through this API.
- The issue was identified during an internal security audit and not reported by customers or community users.
- There were no known SDKs or client-side tools that exposed this behavior before the fix.
- As a workaround, the ability to change passwords could be disabled via a "Deny" rule.
