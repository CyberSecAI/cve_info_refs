The provided content is related to CVE-2021-43441.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied data, specifically input fields, allowing injection of HTML code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- HTML Injection: The application fails to sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML code into the page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can inject malicious HTML content, which could lead to:
    - Phishing attacks: Injecting HTML forms that mimic login pages to steal user credentials.
    - Defacement: Modifying the appearance of the website.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
- Injecting malicious HTML code through input fields that are not properly sanitized.
- Social engineering to lure users to visit a page with the injected payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to submit data to the vulnerable input field in the application.
- Knowledge of HTML to craft malicious payloads.
- Social engineering to trick the user into visiting a malicious link and submitting credentials.
