Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-43970:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper file type validation within the `/quicklert/albumimages.jsp` web form of the Quicklert for Digium Switchvox application. This allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files with dangerous types, such as a JSP file disguised as an MP3, leading to remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload (CWE-434):** The application does not restrict the type of files that can be uploaded. An attacker can upload a malicious file disguised as a media file (e.g., a JSP file disguised as an MP3 file).
- **Insufficient File Type Validation:** The application fails to properly validate the uploaded file's extension or type.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading and then accessing a specially crafted JSP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Complete Server Takeover:** Successful exploitation leads to full compromise of the server, giving the attacker control over the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and potentially allowing access to the victim's DMZ.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is the `/quicklert/albumimages.jsp` web form.
- **File Upload:** Attackers upload malicious files through the vulnerable web form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid (low privilege) user credentials to access the vulnerable upload functionality.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the server hosting the Quicklert application.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the file upload vulnerability and how to craft the malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in Quicklert for Digium Switchvox Version 10 Build 1043.
- The vulnerability was patched in Version 10 Build 1051.
- The proof of concept involves uploading a JSP reverse shell disguised as an MP3 file, using a manipulated filename and adding a valid mp3 header to bypass initial file-type checks.
- The vulnerability was discovered and responsibly disclosed by Assura, Inc.
