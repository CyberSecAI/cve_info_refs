The content relates to CVE-2021-43794.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Discourse handles MIME/Content-Type errors, specifically in development mode. It appears that error responses were being cached by intermediary proxies or misconfigured CDNs, leading to cache poisoning.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the improper caching of error responses, specifically "Invalid MIME type" errors, which can lead to cache poisoning for anonymous users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to poison the cache for anonymous users. This results in users being served a JSON blob instead of the expected HTML page, leading to a partial denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can manipulate requests such that they trigger MIME type errors. These errors, when improperly cached, affect all anonymous users of the platform.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the server that would result in a MIME error response, and rely on intermediary proxies or CDNs to cache these errors.
