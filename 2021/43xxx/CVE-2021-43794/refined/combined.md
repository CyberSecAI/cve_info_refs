# Anonymous user cache poisoning via development-mode header

Moderate

published
GHSA-249g-pc77-65hp
Dec 1, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

stable <= 2.7.10; beta,tests-passed <= 2.8.0.beta8;

## Patched versions

stable >= 2.7.11; beta,tests-passed >= 2.8.0.beta9;

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can poison the cache for anonymous (i.e. not logged in) users, such that the users are shown a JSON blob instead of the HTML page. This can lead to a partial denial-of-service.

### Patches

This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse.

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
