- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The extension "pixx.io integration for TYPO3 (DAM)" (pixxio) fails to properly restrict image downloads to the configured pixx.io DAM URL, leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Additionally, it has broken access control in the bundled media browser and includes a vulnerable 3rd-party component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to the SSRF vulnerability allowing arbitrary file downloads with user-controlled filenames.
    - Broken Access Control allowing unauthenticated requests to the pixx.io API
    - Use of vulnerable 3rd party component (jQuery 3.3.1).
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An attacker can download arbitrary content from remote locations and save it with controlled filenames potentially leading to RCE.
    - An unauthenticated attacker can download media files from the DAM system via the pixx.io API.
    - The inclusion of a vulnerable jQuery library exposes the application to known security flaws in that library.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Exploiting the SSRF vulnerability through the image download functionality.
    - Sending unauthorized requests to the pixx.io API via the broken media browser.
    - Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the bundled jQuery library.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - For the SSRF and RCE vulnerabilities, a TYPO3 backend user account is required.
    - For exploiting the broken access control, no authentication is needed.
    - Exploiting jQuery vulnerabilities depends on the specific flaws in the 3rd party library.
