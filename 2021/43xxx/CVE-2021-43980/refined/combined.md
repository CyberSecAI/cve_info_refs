Package        : tomcat9
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-43980 CVE-2022-23181 CVE-2022-29885

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Tomcat
servlet and JSP engine.

CVE-2021-43980

    The simplified implementation of blocking reads and writes introduced in
    Tomcat 10 and back-ported to Tomcat 9.0.47 onwards exposed a long standing
    (but extremely hard to trigger) concurrency bug that could cause client
    connections to share an Http11Processor instance resulting in responses, or
    part responses, to be received by the wrong client.

CVE-2022-23181

    The fix for bug CVE-2020-9484 introduced a time of check, time of use
    vulnerability into Apache Tomcat that allowed a local attacker to perform
    actions with the privileges of the user that the Tomcat process is using.
    This issue is only exploitable when Tomcat is configured to persist
    sessions using the FileStore.

CVE-2022-29885

    The documentation of Apache Tomcat for the EncryptInterceptor incorrectly
    stated it enabled Tomcat clustering to run over an untrusted network. This
    was not correct. While the EncryptInterceptor does provide confidentiality
    and integrity protection, it does not protect against all risks associated
    with running over any untrusted network, particularly DoS risks.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.0.43-2~deb11u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat9 packages.

its security tracker page at:

Subject: CVE-2021-43980: Apache Tomcat: Information disclosure

Severity: important

Description:

The simplified implementation of blocking reads and writes introduced in
Tomcat 10 and back-ported to Tomcat 9.0.47 onwards exposed a long
standing (but extremely hard to trigger) concurrency bug in Apache
Tomcat 10.1.0 to 10.1.0-M12, 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.18, 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.60
and 8.5.0 to 8.5.77 that could cause client connections to share an
Http11Processor instance resulting in responses, or part responses, to
be received by the wrong client.

Credit:

Thanks to Adam Thomas, Richard Hernandez and Ryan Schmitt for
discovering the issue and working with the Tomcat security team to
identify the root cause and appropriate fix.
