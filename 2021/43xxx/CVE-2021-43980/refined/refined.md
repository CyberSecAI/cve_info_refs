**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by client connections using the simplified blocking reads and writes implementation.
- It is a concurrency issue.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to establish a connection to the affected Tomcat server.
- There is no mention of specific attacker capabilities needed other than establishing connections to the server.
