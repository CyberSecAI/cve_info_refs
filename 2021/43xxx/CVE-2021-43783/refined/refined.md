Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43783:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of `path.resolve` in the `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend` package when resolving file paths within templates. This allowed for path traversal, where an attacker could manipulate paths to write files to arbitrary locations on the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The core vulnerability is a path traversal issue. The use of `path.resolve` without proper sanitization allowed an attacker to specify paths that could navigate outside the intended workspace directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Write:** By exploiting the path traversal, a malicious user with write access to a template or through user input during template execution can write files to any location accessible by the `scaffolder-backend` process on the host system.
*   **Potential Server Compromise:** Depending on the system's configuration and the user the `scaffolder-backend` runs as, this could potentially be used to overwrite system files, configuration files, or deploy malicious code. While the content of the file is not always controlled by the attacker, a carefully crafted template can be used for control of the file content.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Template Manipulation:** An attacker with write access to a registered scaffolder template can modify the template to include malicious path traversals that can write files to arbitrary paths.
*   **User Input Exploitation:** In some scenarios, user input during template execution can be exploited, allowing for path traversal to write files. This method might not always allow the attacker to fully control the file's content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Write Access to Templates:** The primary attack vector requires the attacker to have write access to at least one registered scaffolder template.
*   **Ability to Execute Templates (in some cases):** The vulnerability can also be triggered through user-provided input when executing templates, meaning write access is not always needed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a commit that fixes the vulnerability by removing all usages of `path.resolve` and using `resolveSafeChildPath` from `@backstage/backend-common`. This function ensures that resolved paths are within the intended workspace, preventing path traversal attacks.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in version `0.15.14` of the `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend` package.
*   The fix includes a change in eslint configuration to prevent future usage of `path.resolve`.
