Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the commit:

**Vulnerability:**
The commit addresses a vulnerability related to the `fax_page_size` variable in the `fax_send.php` file. It forces the fax page size to only preset allowed values, preventing users from providing arbitrary values.

**Root cause:**
The original code allowed users to provide any value for `fax_page_size`. This could lead to unexpected behavior.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Input validation: The code lacked proper input validation of the `fax_page_size` parameter, allowing arbitrary values to be passed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact is not specified in the provided commit. The commit message indicates that arbitrary page sizes could cause unexpected behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests with non-standard values for `fax_page_size` to the `fax_send.php` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to access the `fax_send.php` script and manipulate the parameters of the request.
