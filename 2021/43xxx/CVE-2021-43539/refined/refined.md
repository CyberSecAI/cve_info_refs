Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-43539:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a failure to correctly record the location of live pointers across WebAssembly (wasm) instance calls. This caused a garbage collection (GC) during a wasm instance call to not trace these live pointers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **GC Rooting Failure:** Incorrect handling of stack maps for Ion calls to wasm instance methods. The stack maps are not installed correctly, leading to the GC missing roots in the stack frame.
- **Use-After-Free:** Due to the GC not tracing live pointers, some live objects can be collected, and later, the caller could reference unused or reused memory, resulting in a use-after-free condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Potentially Exploitable Crash:**  The use-after-free can lead to a potentially exploitable crash, potentially allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered using specially crafted WebAssembly code. Specifically, it affects wasm builtin calls when the function can return an error and can trigger garbage collection, probably only `ref.func` calls.
- It appears that the vulnerability is more easily triggered with the `gczeal` option turned on, which forces garbage collection on every allocation.
- An attacker could try to place many pointers on the stack, hoping that one points to something useful during a garbage collection cycle.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute WebAssembly code within the context of the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to craft the WebAssembly code in such a way that the vulnerable code path is triggered, causing a garbage collection at the right moment.
- Understanding of how to trigger the garbage collection in the vulnerable code path.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the Ion JIT compiler. The Baseline compiler is not affected
- The issue was found in the context of a crash when `gczeal` was used, it is unclear if it can be exploited easily without such a configuration.
- The vulnerability affects all supported branches, and it was fixed in Firefox 95 and Firefox ESR 91.4.
- The bug was reported by Asumu Takikawa and Ioanna Dimitriou.
