## Path Traversal ([CVE-2021-43798](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-43798))

### Summary

On 2021-12-03, we received a report that Grafana is vulnerable to directory traversal, allowing access to local files. We have confirmed this for versions 8.0.0-beta1 to 8.3.0. Thanks to our defense-in-depth approach, at no time has [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud) been vulnerable.

The vulnerable URL path is: <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins//, where is the plugin ID for any installed plugin.

Every Grafana instance comes with pre-installed plugins like the Prometheus plugin or MySQL plugin so the following URLs are vulnerable for every instance:

* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/alertlist/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/annolist/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/barchart/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/bargauge/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/candlestick/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/cloudwatch/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/dashlist/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/elasticsearch/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/gauge/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/geomap/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/gettingstarted/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/grafana-azure-monitor-datasource/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/graph/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/heatmap/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/histogram/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/influxdb/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/jaeger/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/logs/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/loki/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/mssql/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/mysql/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/news/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/nodeGraph/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/opentsdb
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/piechart/

* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/zipkin/

We have received [CVE-2021-43798](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8pjx-jj86-j47p "CVE-2021-43798") for this issue. The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.5 High (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) for Grafana versions 8.0.0-beta1 to 8.3.0

### Affected versions with high severity

Grafana 8.0.0-beta1 to 8.3.0

### Solutions and mitigations

All installations between v8.0.0-beta1 and v8.3.0 should be upgraded as soon as possible.

If you can not upgrade, running a reverse proxy in front of Grafana that normalizes the PATH of the request will mitigate the vulnerability. For example the normalize\_path setting in envoy.

Thanks to our defense-in-depth approach, [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud) instances have not been affected by the vulnerability.

As always, we closely coordinated with all cloud providers licensed to offer Grafana Pro. They have received early notification under embargo and confirmed that their offerings are secure at the time of this announcement. In alphabetical order, this is applicable to Amazon Managed Grafana, and Azure Managed Grafana.

### Timeline and postmortem

Here is a detailed timeline starting from when we originally learned of the issue. All times in UTC.

* 2021-12-03: Security researcher sends the initial report

Weâve been ***able to greatly decrease fragmentation*** in observability tooling, and ***achieve consistency*** in how we monitor and alert on key signals across our systems. Being able to easily triage issues across metrics, logs, and traces has ***helped us improve system performance as well as increase operator confidence*** when on call.”Jacob StraszynskiStaff Software Engineer![Mux logo](/static/img/logos/logo-mux.svg)“Grafana Cloud probably ***saves us hundreds of engineering hours a year***. Our platform engineers don’t have to manage the stack any more, and our product engineers don’t have to work through multiple observability tools, which used to really slow down our response times.”Ryan GrothouseVP, Engineering![ASOS logo](/media/images/logos/logo-asos.svg)“[Migrating to Grafana Cloud] meant that we could focus on the observability â getting the best out of the platform â without running it…Grafana Cloud Metrics has also helped the team cut costs. Itâs cheaper to store this data in a Prometheus format. ***So by offsetting some logs to metrics and moving that data into Grafana Cloud Metrics, we were able to save a significant amount of money.”***Dylan MorleyLead Principal Engineer![tomtom logo](/media/images/logos/logo-tomtom-2022.png)“It didnât take much time or effort to bring all these different data sources into a single Grafana dashboard using Grafana Cloud. From problem statement to having our first business dashboard up and running was two weeks. And now, months removed from our launch, ***Grafana Cloud is helping us to track SLAs, reduce MTTR, and foster an observability-centric culture***.”Carl MeertSite Reliability Engineer![Teletracking logo](/media/images/logos/logo-teletracking.png)“Grafana Cloud Metrics and Logs not only give us greater visibility into our services, but serve as key feedback mechanisms for an ever-evolving developer experience. We have also lowered our overhead…***Thanks to 50% savings on our telemetry bill with Adaptive Metrics, we had room in our budget to fund Grafana IRM*** and now we spend less time on our incident workflow including reducing our toil on postmortems and incident reports.”Oren LionDirector of Software Engineering

## Path Traversal ([CVE-2021-43798](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-43798))

### Summary

On 2021-12-03, we received a report that Grafana is vulnerable to directory traversal, allowing access to local files. We have confirmed this for versions 8.0.0-beta1 to 8.3.0. Thanks to our defense-in-depth approach, at no time has [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud) been vulnerable.

The vulnerable URL path is: <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins//, where is the plugin ID for any installed plugin.

Every Grafana instance comes with pre-installed plugins like the Prometheus plugin or MySQL plugin so the following URLs are vulnerable for every instance:

* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/alertlist/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/annolist/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/barchart/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/bargauge/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/candlestick/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/cloudwatch/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/dashlist/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/elasticsearch/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/gauge/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/geomap/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/gettingstarted/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/grafana-azure-monitor-datasource/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/graph/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/heatmap/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/histogram/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/influxdb/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/jaeger/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/logs/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/loki/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/mssql/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/mysql/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/news/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/nodeGraph/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/opentsdb
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/piechart/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/pluginlist/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/postgres/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/prometheus/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/stackdriver/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/stat/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/state-timeline/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/status-history/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/table/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/table-old/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/tempo/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/testdata/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/text/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/timeseries/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/welcome/
* <grafana\_host\_url>/public/plugins/zipkin/

We have received [CVE-2021-43798](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8pjx-jj86-j47p "CVE-2021-43798") for this issue. The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.5 High (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) for Grafana versions 8.0.0-beta1 to 8.3.0

### Affected versions with high severity

Grafana 8.0.0-beta1 to 8.3.0

### Solutions and mitigations

All installations between v8.0.0-beta1 and v8.3.0 should be upgraded as soon as possible.

If you can not upgrade, running a reverse proxy in front of Grafana that normalizes the PATH of the request will mitigate the vulnerability. For example the normalize\_path setting in envoy.

Thanks to our defense-in-depth approach, [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud) instances have not been affected by the vulnerability.

As always, we closely coordinated with all cloud providers licensed to offer Grafana Pro. They have received early notification under embargo and confirmed that their offerings are secure at the time of this announcement. In alphabetical order, this is applicable to Amazon Managed Grafana, and Azure Managed Grafana.

### Timeline and postmortem

Here is a detailed timeline starting from when we originally learned of the issue. All times in UTC.

* 2021-12-03: Security researcher sends the initial report

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Choose your Configuration Options

The Grafana backend has a number of [configuration options](/docs/installation/configuration/) defined in its config file (usually located at /etc/grafana/grafana.ini on linux systems).

In this config file you can change things like the default admin password, http port, grafana database (sqlite3, mysql, postgres), authentication options (google, github, ldap, auth proxy) along with many other options.

Start your grafana server. Login with your admin user (default admin/admin). Open side menu (click the Grafana icon in top menu) head to Data Sources and add your data source.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).

The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

# An update on 0day CVE-2021-43798: Grafana directory traversal

[![Richard "RichiH" Hartmann](/static/img/about/richard_hartmann.jpg?w=58)](/author/richih/)

[Richard "RichiH" Hartmann](/author/richih/)

**Note:** *We released fixes for CVE-2021-41090 and CVE-2021-43798 within 24 hours and mixed them up in one of the three blog posts. To make it clear: CVE-2021-41090 is for the Grafana **Agent** and CVE-2021-43798 is for Grafana **the software**. Only CVE-2021-43798 was a 0day exploit.*

**Note:** *A previous version of this blog post included the wrong CVE. It has been corrected. The timeline has also been updated.*

Yesterday, we [released an update to Grafana](/blog/2021/12/07/grafana-8.3.1-8.2.7-8.1.8-and-8.0.7-released-with-high-severity-security-fix/) fixing a directory traversal attack tracked under [CVE-2021-43798](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-43798).

We wanted to blog about it again today for two reasons: First, we wanted to give more insight into our timeline as external events forced us to deviate from our planned timeline. On the âpositiveâ side, we had our first 0day!

Second, given the [AWS outage](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/amazons-prime-ring-other-apps-down-thousands-users-2021-12-07/) yesterday, we wanted to re-amplify the message that **all users should upgrade their Grafana 8.x instances as soon as possible**.

We are releasing this update in coordination with Jordy Versmissen, the researcher who notified us of the vulnerability. You can find the story of how he found the vulnerability in his [blog post](https://j0vsec.com/post/cve-2021-43798/).

## Please upgrade your Grafana 8.x instances

Again, we are re-releasing this information largely to raise awareness and get all users to upgrade their Grafana 8.x instances. If you have any of those, please **UPGRADE RIGHT NOW**. This blog post will wait for you until youâre done â promise!

For a description of the vulnerability and download links, please [see our advisory](/blog/2021/12/07/grafana-8.3.1-8.2.7-8.1.8-and-8.0.7-released-with-high-severity-security-fix/).

## Normal mode

Our internal vulnerability handling procedure follows these steps:

1. Discovery / reporting
2. Confirmation & assessment
3. Incident declared
4. Mitigate vulnerability in Grafana Cloud
5. Bugfix
6. Testing
7. Creation of release plan
8. Deployment of fix on Cloud (if applicable)
9. Limited release for customers
10. Public release
11. Postmortem finalized

And we happily followed these steps until yesterday, when we realized that a 0day was out in the wild.

## More detailed timeline

Itâs important to note that weâre listing this timeline in the spirit of full transparency. We also strongly believe in [blameless postmortems](https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture), internally and externally. Mistakes happen, in particular when youâre happy and excited. The good thing about mistakes that are treated respectfully and transparently is that the maximum amount of people can learn from them.

As such, onwards! All times in UTC:

* 2021-12-03 02:51: We received and escalated a ticket at security@grafana.com
* 2021-12-03 07:57: Vulnerability confirmed
* 2021-12-03 08:41: Incident declared
* 2021-12-03 08:42: Grafana Cloud confirmed not to be vulnerable
* 2021-12-03 08:42: Jordy tweets and deletes about âread arbitrary files on the host, no authentication neededâ (**Editorâs note**: We were not aware of this until 2021-12-07.)
* 2021-12-03 09:37: v8.0.0-beta1 to v8.3.0 are affected
* 2021-12-03 09:57: Identified PR introducing vulnerability
* 2021-12-03 09:58: CVE Request sent; Provisional assessment 7.5 High CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
* 2021-12-03 10:57: Root cause found
* 2021-12-03 02:49: Release plan set: 2021-12-07 for private customer release, 2021-12-14 for public release (**Editorâs note**: We never release on Monday or Friday to spare the weekends of customers and users. Customers get a week to upgrade under strict embargo.)
* 2021-12-03 18:13: Patches ready
* 2021-12-06 11:26: Second report about the vulnerability received. Follow-up determines that itâs coming through a bug bounty program. Jordy confirms that he submitted to a bug bounty program in parallel to us
* 2021-12-07 09:04: We become aware of public discussion around the vulnerability. This is now a 0day
* 2021-12-07 09:07: Emergency release plan started
* 2021-12-07 09:07: Decision to maintain complete radio silence to avoid increasing visibility
* 2021-12-07 14:18: Private release with reduced 2-hour grace period, not the usual 1-week timeframe
* 2021-12-07 16:14: Full public release

## Lessons learned

The vulnerability Jordy found is one of the problem types I personally like the most (at least when not directly affected myself): The obvious-in-hindsight ones. It took someone to do the work, and once theyâve done the work, others will claim how trivial it all is. **But it did take someone to do the actual work first**.

Unfortunately, in this case, this meant that once people knew what to look for, find it they did â and quickly. We will add boilerplate language asking for radio silence to both our reporting how to guidelines and to our security@grafana.com response and will incentivize this with a formal bug bounty (see below).

We had to build an impressive amount of release artifacts in a rather short amount of time. Eight releases, four private and four public ones, multiplied by all the platforms and deployment models we support. In total, we ended up releasing dozens and dozens of full artifacts within mere hours. Plus, we had some build failures during release. We will have a release engineering sprint within the next few weeks to allow us to seamlessly build private releases and to massively speed up overall release build speed.

We are already working on establishing a bug bounty program for Grafana Labs. While it will take us some more time to release it, if we had it in place by last Friday, we would not have inadvertently created an incentive for Jordy to submit to other third parties. We strongly believe that researchers should be able to live through their work and will introduce a bug bounty program soon. If you have opinions on bug bounty programs, [please see my Twitter poll](https://twitter.com/TwitchiH/status/1468603856670109700).

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank [Jordy Versmissen](https://twitter.com/j0v0x0) for finding the vulnerability and alerting us to it.

## Postmortem

We are currently working on a full postmortem and will publish it on our blog as soon as itâs ready.

Subject: CVE-2021-43813 and CVE-2021-43815 - Grafana directory traversal for
 some .md and .csv files

We released Grafana 8.3.2 and 7.5.12 on December 10th. This patch release
includes a moderate severity security fix for directory traversal for:

   - arbitrary .md files: CVE-2021-43813, Grafana 5.0.0 to 8.3.1, and
   - arbitrary .csv files: CVE-2021-43815, Grafana 8.0.0-beta3 to 8.3.1.

The vulnerabilities are limited in scope, and only allow access to files
with the extension .md or .csv to authenticated users. The .csv vulnerability
requires a developer testing tool called TestData DB
<<https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/testdata/>> data source
to be enabled and configured, and this feature is not enabled per default.

Thanks to our defense-in-depth approach, at no time has Grafana Cloud
<<https://grafana.com/cloud>> been vulnerable.

This is a follow-up patch to our recent CVE-2021-43798
<<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-43798>> release. If
you haven’t read about that high severity security fix, we recommend you
review the initial blog post
<<https://grafana.com/blog/2021/12/07/grafana-8.3.1-8.2.7-8.1.8-and-8.0.7-released-with-high-severity-security-fix/>>
along
with our update on the 0day
<<https://grafana.com/blog/2021/12/08/an-update-on-0day-cve-2021-43798-grafana-directory-traversal/>>
.

Given the attention CVE-2021-43798 has brought, there’s a risk that
additional researchers will find CVE-2021-43813. Out of an abundance of
caution and given that both CVE-2021-43813 and CVE-2021-43815 are only CVSS
Score 4.3 Moderate CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N through
their limited scope, we are immediately releasing to the public and on a
Friday.

We identified several vulnerability issues in the last few weeks and at a
higher rate than in the years before. The infosec industry usually comes
together after a few CVEs, and we benefit from that extra scrutiny.
Although it can be difficult, ultimately it’s for the overall benefit of
Grafana and the community. Please know that this is a top priority for us.
We are spending significant resources on this in the remainder of 2021
already, including full outside assessment. We will continue and increase
this investment in 2022 and beyond.

Directory Traversal (CVE-2021-43813
<<https://github.com/grafana/grafana/security/advisories/GHSA-c3q8-26ph-9g2q>>
)Summary

CVSS Score: 4.3 Moderate CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N,
Grafana versions 5.0.0 to 8.3.1

On 2021-12-09, GitHub Security Labs notified us of a vulnerability through
which authenticated users could read out fully lowercase or fully uppercase
.md files through directory traversal. Doing our own follow-up
investigation we found a related vulnerability through which authenticated
users could read out arbitrary .csv files through directory traversal.
Thanks to our defense-in-depth approach, at no time has Grafana Cloud
<<https://grafana.com/cloud/?pg=blog>> been vulnerable.

The vulnerable URL path is: /api/plugins/.*/markdown/.* for .md files
Affected versions with moderate severity

CVE-2021-43813: Grafana 5.0.0 to 8.3.1
CVE-2021-43815: Grafana 8.0.0-beta3 to 8.3.1
Solutions and mitigations

All installations between 5.0.0 and 8.3.1 should be upgraded as soon as
possible.

If you cannot upgrade, running a reverse proxy in front of Grafana that
normalizes the PATH of the request will mitigate the vulnerability. The
proxy will have to also be able to handle url encoded paths. Alternatively,
for fully lowercase or fully uppercase .md files, you can block
/api/plugins/.*/markdown/.* without losing any functionality beyond inlined
plugin help text.

To mitigate the csv path traversal vulnerability all configured TestData DB
<<https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/testdata/>> data
sources (a UI testing data source that is disabled by default) should be
deleted.

## Path Traversal ([CVE-2021-43798](
<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-43798>))

### Summary

On 2021-12-03, we received a report that Grafana is vulnerable to directory
traversal, allowing access to local files. We have confirmed this for
versions 8.0.0-beta1 to 8.3.0. Thanks to our defense-in-depth approach, at
no time has [Grafana Cloud](<https://grafana.com/cloud>) been vulnerable.

The vulnerable URL path is: <grafana_host_url>/public/plugins/<plugin-id>/,
where <plugin-id> is the plugin ID for any installed plugin.

Every Grafana instance comes with pre-installed plugins like the Prometheus
plugin or MySQL plugin so the following URLs are vulnerable for every
instance:

* <grafana_host_url>/public/plugins/alertlist/

* <grafana_host_url>/public/plugins/annolist/

* <grafana_host_url>/public/plugins/barchart/

* <grafana_host_url>/public/plugins/bargauge/

* <grafana_host_url>/public/plugins/candlestick/

* <grafana_host_url>/public/plugins/cloudwatch/

* <grafana_host_url>/public/plugins/dashlist/

* <grafana_host_url>/public/plugins/elasticsearch/

* <grafana_host_url>/public/plugins/gauge/

* <grafana_host_url>/public/plugins/geomap/

* <grafana_host_url>/public/plugins/gettingstarted/

* <grafana_host_url>/public/plugins/grafana-azure-monitor-datasource/

* <grafana_host_url>/public/plugins/graph/

* <grafana_host_url>/public/plugins/heatmap/

* <grafana_host_url>/public/plugins/histogram/

* <grafana_host_url>/public/plugins/influxdb/

* <grafana_host_url>/public/plugins/jaeger/

* <grafana_host_url>/public/plugins/logs/

We have received CVE-2021-43798 for this issue. The CVSS score for this
vulnerability is 7.5 High (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
for Grafana versions 8.0.0-beta1 to 8.3.0

### Affected versions with high severity

Grafana 8.0.0-beta1 to 8.3.0

### Solutions and mitigations

All installations between v8.0.0-beta1 and v8.3.0 should be upgraded as
soon as possible.

If you can not upgrade, running a reverse proxy in front of Grafana that
normalizes the PATH of the request will mitigate the vulnerability. For
example the normalize_path
<<https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/network/http_connection_manager/v3/http_connection_manager.proto#envoy-v3-api-field-extensions-filters-network-http-connection-manager-v3-httpconnectionmanager-normalize-path>>
setting in envoy.

Thanks to our defense-in-depth approach, [Grafana Cloud](
<https://grafana.com/cloud>) instances have not been affected by the
vulnerability.

As always, we closely coordinated with all cloud providers licensed to
offer Grafana Pro. They have received early notification under embargo and
confirmed that their offerings are secure at the time of this announcement.
In alphabetical order, this is applicable to Amazon Managed Grafana, and
Azure Managed Grafana.

**Note:** *We released fixes for CVE-2021-41090 and CVE-2021-43798 within 24 hours and mixed them up in one of the three blog posts. To make it clear: CVE-2021-41090 is for the Grafana **Agent** and CVE-2021-43798 is for Grafana **the software**. Only CVE-2021-43798 was a 0day exploit.*

**Note:** *A previous version of this blog post included the wrong CVE. It has been corrected. The timeline has also been updated.*

Yesterday, we [released an update to Grafana](/blog/2021/12/07/grafana-8.3.1-8.2.7-8.1.8-and-8.0.7-released-with-high-severity-security-fix/) fixing a directory traversal attack tracked under [CVE-2021-43798](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-43798).

We wanted to blog about it again today for two reasons: First, we wanted to give more insight into our timeline as external events forced us to deviate from our planned timeline. On the âpositiveâ side, we had our first 0day!

Second, given the [AWS outage](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/amazons-prime-ring-other-apps-down-thousands-users-2021-12-07/) yesterday, we wanted to re-amplify the message that **all users should upgrade their Grafana 8.x instances as soon as possible**.

We are releasing this update in coordination with Jordy Versmissen, the researcher who notified us of the vulnerability. You can find the story of how he found the vulnerability in his [blog post](https://j0vsec.com/post/cve-2021-43798/).

## Please upgrade your Grafana 8.x instances

Again, we are re-releasing this information largely to raise awareness and get all users to upgrade their Grafana 8.x instances. If you have any of those, please **UPGRADE RIGHT NOW**. This blog post will wait for you until youâre done â promise!

For a description of the vulnerability and download links, please [see our advisory](/blog/2021/12/07/grafana-8.3.1-8.2.7-8.1.8-and-8.0.7-released-with-high-severity-security-fix/).

## Normal mode

Our internal vulnerability handling procedure follows these steps:

1. Discovery / reporting
2. Confirmation & assessment
3. Incident declared
4. Mitigate vulnerability in Grafana Cloud
5. Bugfix
6. Testing
7. Creation of release plan
8. Deployment of fix on Cloud (if applicable)
9. Limited release for customers
10. Public release
11. Postmortem finalized

And we happily followed these steps until yesterday, when we realized that a 0day was out in the wild.

## More detailed timeline

Itâs important to note that weâre listing this timeline in the spirit of full transparency. We also strongly believe in [blameless postmortems](https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture), internally and externally. Mistakes happen, in particular when youâre happy and excited. The good thing about mistakes that are treated respectfully and transparently is that the maximum amount of people can learn from them.

As such, onwards! All times in UTC:

* 2021-12-03 02:51: We received and escalated a ticket at security@grafana.com
* 2021-12-03 07:57: Vulnerability confirmed
* 2021-12-03 08:41: Incident declared
* 2021-12-03 08:42: Grafana Cloud confirmed not to be vulnerable
* 2021-12-03 08:42: Jordy tweets and deletes about âread arbitrary files on the host, no authentication neededâ (**Editorâs note**: We were not aware of this until 2021-12-07.)
* 2021-12-03 09:37: v8.0.0-beta1 to v8.3.0 are affected
* 2021-12-03 09:57: Identified PR introducing vulnerability
* 2021-12-03 09:58: CVE Request sent; Provisional assessment 7.5 High CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
* 2021-12-03 10:57: Root cause found
* 2021-12-03 02:49: Release plan set: 2021-12-07 for private customer release, 2021-12-14 for public release (**Editorâs note**: We never release on Monday or Friday to spare the weekends of customers and users. Customers get a week to upgrade under strict embargo.)
* 2021-12-03 18:13: Patches ready
* 2021-12-06 11:26: Second report about the vulnerability received. Follow-up determines that itâs coming through a bug bounty program. Jordy confirms that he submitted to a bug bounty program in parallel to us
* 2021-12-07 09:04: We become aware of public discussion around the vulnerability. This is now a 0day
* 2021-12-07 09:07: Emergency release plan started
* 2021-12-07 09:07: Decision to maintain complete radio silence to avoid increasing visibility
* 2021-12-07 14:18: Private release with reduced 2-hour grace period, not the usual 1-week timeframe
* 2021-12-07 16:14: Full public release

## Lessons learned

The vulnerability Jordy found is one of the problem types I personally like the most (at least when not directly affected myself): The obvious-in-hindsight ones. It took someone to do the work, and once theyâve done the work, others will claim how trivial it all is. **But it did take someone to do the actual work first**.

Unfortunately, in this case, this meant that once people knew what to look for, find it they did â and quickly. We will add boilerplate language asking for radio silence to both our reporting how to guidelines and to our security@grafana.com response and will incentivize this with a formal bug bounty (see below).

We had to build an impressive amount of release artifacts in a rather short amount of time. Eight releases, four private and four public ones, multiplied by all the platforms and deployment models we support. In total, we ended up releasing dozens and dozens of full artifacts within mere hours. Plus, we had some build failures during release. We will have a release engineering sprint within the next few weeks to allow us to seamlessly build private releases and to massively speed up overall release build speed.

We are already working on establishing a bug bounty program for Grafana Labs. While it will take us some more time to release it, if we had it in place by last Friday, we would not have inadvertently created an incentive for Jordy to submit to other third parties. We strongly believe that researchers should be able to live through their work and will introduce a bug bounty program soon. If you have opinions on bug bounty programs, [please see my Twitter poll](https://twitter.com/TwitchiH/status/1468603856670109700).

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank [Jordy Versmissen](https://twitter.com/j0v0x0) for finding the vulnerability and alerting us to it.

## Postmortem

We are currently working on a full postmortem and will publish it on our blog as soon as itâs ready.
