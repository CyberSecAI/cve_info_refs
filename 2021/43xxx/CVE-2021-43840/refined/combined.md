# Path traversal when MessageBus::Diagnostics is enabled

Moderate

[SamSaffron](/SamSaffron)
published
GHSA-xmgj-5fh3-xjmm
Dec 17, 2021

## Package

MessageBus
(Ruby)

## Affected versions

< 3.3.6

## Patched versions

>= 3.3.7

## Description

### Impact

Users who deployed message bus with diagnostics features enabled (default off) were vulnerable to a path traversal bug, which could lead to disclosure of secret information on a machine if an unintended user were to gain access to the diagnostic route. The impact is also greater if there is no proxy for your web application as the number of steps up the directories is not bounded. For deployments which uses a proxy, the impact varies. For example, If a request goes through a proxy like Nginx with `merge_slashes` enabled, the number of steps up the directories that can be read is limited to 3 levels.

### Patches

Patched in 3.3.7.

### Workarounds

Disable MessageBus::Diagnostics in production like environments.

### Severity

Moderate

4.2

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
