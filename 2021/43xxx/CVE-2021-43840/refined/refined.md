Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2021-43840.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a path traversal issue in the diagnostics route of the `message_bus` gem when the diagnostics feature is enabled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal: The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input when accessing files via the diagnostics route, allowing attackers to traverse the file system using relative paths (e.g., `../`).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information such as configuration files, source code, and environment variables.
- The impact is greater when no proxy is used since directory traversal is unbounded. When a proxy such as Nginx is enabled with merge_slashes, then the number of directories that can be read is limited to 3 levels.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is exploitable via network requests.
- Attackers send a crafted HTTP request to the diagnostics route with a path traversal payload in the file path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the affected server.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the diagnostics route.
- The `MessageBus::Diagnostics` feature needs to be enabled, which is disabled by default.
- High privileges are needed to access the diagnostics route.
- The attacker needs to know the path of the file they want to read using the path traversal.
- User interaction is required.
