- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The extension "Job Fair" (jobfair) fails to protect or obfuscate filenames of uploaded files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive Data Exposure. The application does not properly secure uploaded files, making them accessible to unauthorized users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated users can download files with sensitive data by guessing the filename of uploaded files.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can guess the filename of uploaded files (e.g., uploads/tx\_jobfair/cv.pdf) to directly access and download them without authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability, only to guess the filename of the uploaded files.
