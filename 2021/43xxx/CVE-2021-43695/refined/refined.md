Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-43695:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input (specifically, the `$_REQUEST` variable) before it is used in a message that is printed to the user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The `$_REQUEST` parameter is used without sanitization in `page.backup_restore.php` when calling the `exit` function, which terminates the script and prints the unsanitized message to the user. Additionally, the `dbug` function also uses the `$_REQUEST` parameter without sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious script code into the `$_REQUEST` variable. When this unsanitized input is output to the user's browser, the malicious script will execute, potentially leading to various malicious activities such as:
    - Cookie stealing
    - Session hijacking
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Modifying website content

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP requests by manipulating parameters in the `$_REQUEST` variable.
- The specific vulnerability occurs in `page.backup_restore.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application with malicious data in the request parameters (in the `$_REQUEST` variable).
- The attacker does not require authentication.
- The attacker would need to find a way to trigger the vulnerable code path in order for the XSS payload to execute.
