- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unsigned integer underflow flaw in the TCP transport within the PLC4C implementation of Apache PLC4X.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unsigned integer underflow leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious device could send a crafted server response with invalid content leading to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** A user connecting to a malicious device which sends a crafted response.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to control a PLC device on the network that the vulnerable client connects to and is able to send a malicious response.
