Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-43837:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `vault-cli` tool interprets secret values prefixed with `!template!` as Jinja2 templates. Jinja2 is a powerful templating engine that, if not used carefully, can be exploited for Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** The core vulnerability is an exploitable SSTI. By controlling the content of the vault secret, an attacker can inject arbitrary Jinja2 template code that will be executed when the `vault-cli` tool renders the template.
*   **Insecure Use of Jinja2:** The `vault-cli` tool doesn't sanitize or restrict what template code is allowed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the machine where `vault-cli` is being run.
*   **Compromise of Vault Credentials:**  After gaining RCE, an attacker could use the compromised `vault-cli` context to abuse the token that vault-cli uses to read, write, or delete other data from the vault.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to manipulate a secret value that is read by `vault-cli`. This could be achieved if:
    *  The attacker can directly modify secrets in the vault.
    *  The attacker can influence a system that injects malicious values in the vault.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to modify or influence the content of secrets stored in the vault that `vault-cli` reads.
*   The attacker needs to get the `vault-cli` tool to render the template string.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in `vault-cli` versions >=0.7.0 and <3.0.0.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in `vault-cli` version 3.0.0 by removing support for templated secrets.
*   **Workarounds** were provided: the vulnerability can be avoided by disabling template rendering by:
    *   Setting the environment variable `VAULT_CLI_RENDER=false`
    *   Using the flag `--no-render`
    *   Setting `render: false` in the vault-cli configuration file.
    *   Using the python library with `vault_cli.get_client(render=False)`.
