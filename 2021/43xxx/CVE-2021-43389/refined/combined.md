Subject: [There is an array-index-out-bounds bug in detach_capi_ctr in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c](#r)
Date: Fri, 24 Sep 2021 16:44:21 +0800	[[thread overview]](#r)
Message-ID: <CAFcO6XOvGQrRTaTkaJ0p3zR7y7nrAWD79r48=L_BbOyrK9X-vA@mail.gmail.com> (<raw>)

Hi, there is an array-index-out-bounds bug in detach_capi_ctr in
drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c and I reproduce it on 5.15.0-rc2+.

###Analyze
 we can call CMTPCONNADD ioctl and it would invoke
do_cmtp_sock_ioctl(), it would call cmtp_add_connection().
the chain of call is as follows.
ioctl(CMTPCONNADD)
   ->cmtp_sock_ioctl()
         -->do_cmtp_sock_ioctl()
            --->cmtp_add_connection()
                ---->kthread_run()
                ---->cmtp_attach_device()
the function would add a cmtp session to a controller. Let us see the code.
```
int cmtp_add_connection(struct cmtp_connadd_req *req, struct socket *sock)
{
u32 valid_flags = BIT(CMTP_LOOPBACK);
struct cmtp_session *session, *s;
int i, err;

BT_DBG("");

if (!l2cap_is_socket(sock))
return -EBADFD;

if (req->flags & ~valid_flags)
return -EINVAL;

session = kzalloc(sizeof(struct cmtp_session), GFP_KERNEL);   ///
alloc and clear struct cmtp_session 'session' by kzalloc().
if (!session)
return -ENOMEM;

[...]

session->task = kthread_run(cmtp_session, session,
"kcmtpd_ctr_%d",session->num); ///  create and run a kernel thread
invoke cmtp_session() and the args is 'session'

[...]

if (!(session->flags & BIT(CMTP_LOOPBACK))) {
err = cmtp_attach_device(session);   ///   invoke cmtp_attach_device()
to attach a session with a controller.
if (err < 0) {
/* Caller will call fput in case of failure, and so
* will cmtp_session kthread.
*/
get_file(session->sock->file);

atomic_inc(&session->terminate);
wake_up_interruptible(sk_sleep(session->sock->sk));
up_write(&cmtp_session_sem);
return err;
}
}
[...]

```
the struct cmtp_session have a member named struct capi_ctr 'ctrl'.
struct capi_ctr have a member named 'cnr', it is controller number.

the kernel thread would invoke cmtp_session(), it would call
cmtp_detach_device() to detach a session and the registration of a
controller.
cmtp_session()
     ->cmtp_detach_device()
          ->detach_capi_ctr()
let us see detach_capi_ctr() function implement.
```
int detach_capi_ctr(struct capi_ctr *ctr)
{
int err = 0;

mutex_lock(&capi_controller_lock);

ctr_down(ctr, CAPI_CTR_DETACHED);

if (capi_controller[ctr->cnr - 1] != ctr) {   /// use
cmtp_session->capi_ctr->cnr
err = -EINVAL;
goto unlock_out;
}
capi_controller[ctr->cnr - 1] = NULL;
ncontrollers--;

[...]

```
If the cmtp_add_connection() call cmtp_attach_device() not yet, the
cmtp_session->capi_ctr->cnr just is an ZERO.

The capi_controller[-1] make no sense. so should check that the
cmtp_session->capi_ctr->cnr is not an ZERO.

Debian Bug     : 988044 989285 990411 994050

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2020-29374

    Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
    management.  A parent and child process initially share all their
    memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
    duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write).  However, in case an
    operation such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an
    additional reference to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs
    during this operation, the kernel might have accessed the wrong
    process's memory.  For some programs, this could lead to an
    information leak or data corruption.

    This issue was already fixed for most architectures, but not on
    MIPS and System z.  This update corrects that.

CVE-2020-36322, CVE-2021-28950

    The syzbot tool found that the FUSE (filesystem-in-user-space)
    implementation did not correctly handle a FUSE server returning
    invalid attributes for a file.  A local user permitted to run a
    FUSE server could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    The original fix for this introduced a different potential denial
    of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has also been
    fixed.

CVE-2021-3640

    Lin Ma discovered a race condiiton in the Bluetooth protocol
    implementation that can lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3744, CVE-2021-3764

    minihanshen reported bugs in the ccp driver for AMD
    Cryptographic Coprocessors that could lead to a resource leak.
    On systems using this driver, a local user could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service.

CVE-2021-3752

    Likang Luo of NSFOCUS Security Team discovered a flaw in the
    Bluetooth L2CAP implementation that can lead to a user-after-free.
    A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3760, CVE-2021-4202

    Lin Ma discovered race conditions in the NCI (NFC Controller
    Interface) driver, which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-3772

    A flaw was found in the SCTP protocol implementation, which would
    allow a networked attacker to break an SCTP association.  The
    attacker would only need to know or guess the IP addresses and
    ports for the association.

CVE-2021-4002

    It was discovered that hugetlbfs, the virtual filesystem used by
    applications to allocate huge pages in RAM, did not flush the
    CPU's TLB in one case where it was necessary.  In some
    circumstances a local user would be able to read and write huge
    pages after they are freed and reallocated to a different process.
    This could lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or
    information leaks.

CVE-2021-4083

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the local (Unix) sockets
    garbage collector, that can lead to use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-4135

    A flaw was found in the netdevsim driver which would lead to an
    information leak.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-4155

    Kirill Tkhai discovered a data leak in the way the XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP
    IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for a size increase of files
    with unaligned size. A local attacker can take advantage of this
    flaw to leak data on the XFS filesystem.

CVE-2021-4203

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the local (Unix) sockets
    implementation that can lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this to leak sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2021-20317

    It was discovered that the timer queue structure could become
    corrupt, leading to waiting tasks never being woken up.  A local
    user with certain privileges could exploit this to cause a denial
    of service (system hang).

CVE-2021-20321

    A race condition was discovered in the overlayfs filesystem
    driver.  A local user with access to an overlayfs mount and to its
    underlying upper directory could exploit this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-20322

    An information leak was discovered in the IPv4 implementation.  A
    remote attacker could exploit this to quickly discover which UDP
    ports a system is using, making it easier for them to carry out a
    DNS poisoning attack against that system.

CVE-2021-22600

    The syzbot tool found a flaw in the packet socket (AF_PACKET)
    implementation which could lead to incorrectly freeing memory.  A
    local user with CAP_NET_RAW capability (in any user namespace)
    could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713 (XSA-391)

    Juergen Gross reported that malicious PV backends can cause a denial
    of service to guests being serviced by those backends via high
    frequency events, even if those backends are running in a less
    privileged environment.

CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715 (XSA-392)

    Juergen Gross discovered that Xen guests can force the Linux
    netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory, resulting in
    denial of service.

CVE-2021-38300

    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a flaw in the classic BPF (cBPF) JIT
    compiler for MIPS architectures.  A local user could exploit
    this to excute arbitrary code in the kernel.

    This issue is mitigated by setting sysctl
    net.core.bpf_jit_enable=0, which is the default.  It is *not*
    mitigated by disabling unprivileged use of eBPF.

CVE-2021-39685

    Szymon Heidrich discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the
    USB gadget subsystem, resulting in information disclosure, denial of
    service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-39686

    A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, that
    could lead to incorrect security checks.  On systems where the
    binder driver is loaded, a local user could exploit this for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-39698

    Linus Torvalds reported a flaw in the file polling implementation,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user could exploit
    this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-39713

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling
    subsystem which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-41864

    An integer overflow was discovered in the Extended BPF (eBPF)
    subsystem.  A local user could exploit this for denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

    This can be mitigated by setting sysctl
    kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1, which disables eBPF use by
    unprivileged users.

CVE-2021-42739

    A heap buffer overflow was discovered in the firedtv driver for
    FireWire-connected DVB receivers.  A local user with access to a
    firedtv device could exploit this for denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-43389

    The Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a flaw in the CMTP
    subsystem as used by Bluetooth, which could lead to an
    out-of-bounds read and object type confusion.  A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in the initial user namespace could
    exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash),
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-43975

    Brendan Dolan-Gavitt reported a flaw in the
    hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait() function in the aQuantia AQtion ethernet
    device driver which can result in denial of service or the execution
    of arbitrary code.

CVE-2021-43976

    Zekun Shen and Brendan Dolan-Gavitt discovered a flaw in the
    mwifiex_usb_recv() function of the Marvell WiFi-Ex USB Driver. An
    attacker able to connect a crafted USB device can take advantage of
    this flaw to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2021-44733

    A race condition was discovered in the Trusted Execution
    Environment (TEE) subsystem for Arm processors, which could lead
    to a use-after-free.  A local user permitted to access a TEE
    device could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-45095

    It was discovered that the Phone Network protocol (PhoNet) driver
    has a reference count leak in the pep_sock_accept() function.

CVE-2021-45469

    Wenqing Liu reported an out-of-bounds memory access in the f2fs
    implementation if an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. An
    attacker able to mount a specially crafted image can take advantage
    of this flaw for denial of service.

CVE-2021-45480

    A memory leak flaw was discovered in the __rds_conn_create()
    function in the RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) protocol subsystem.

CVE-2022-0001 (INTEL-SA-00598)

    Researchers at VUSec discovered that the Branch History Buffer in
    Intel processors can be exploited to create information side-
    channels with speculative execution.  This issue is similar to
    Spectre variant 2, but requires additional mitigations on some
    processors.

    This can be exploited to obtain sensitive information from a
    different security context, such as from user-space to the kernel,
    or from a KVM guest to the kernel.

CVE-2022-0002 (INTEL-SA-00598)

    This is a similar issue to CVE-2022-0001, but covers exploitation
    within a security context, such as from JIT-compiled code in a
    sandbox to hosting code in the same process.

    This can be partly mitigated by disabling eBPF for unprivileged
    users with the sysctl: kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=2.  This
    update does that by default.

CVE-2022-0322

    Eiichi Tsukata discovered a flaw in the sctp_make_strreset_req()
    function in the SCTP network protocol implementation which can
    result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-0330

    Sushma Venkatesh Reddy discovered a missing GPU TLB flush in the
    i915 driver, resulting in denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-0435

    Samuel Page and Eric Dumazet reported a stack overflow in the
    networking module for the Transparent Inter-Process Communication
    (TIPC) protocol, resulting in denial of service or potentially the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2022-0487

    A use-after-free was discovered in the MOXART SD/MMC Host Controller
    support driver. This flaw does not impact the Debian binary packages
    as CONFIG_MMC_MOXART is not set.

CVE-2022-0492

    Yiqi Sun and Kevin Wang reported that the cgroup-v1 subsystem does
    not properly restrict access to the release-agent feature. A local
    user can take advantage of this flaw for privilege escalation and
    bypass of namespace isolation.

CVE-2022-0617

    butt3rflyh4ck discovered a NULL pointer dereference in the UDF
    filesystem. A local user that can mount a specially crafted UDF
    image can use this flaw to crash the system.

CVE-2022-0644

    Hao Sun reported a missing check for file read permission in the
    finit_module() and kexec_file_load() system calls.  The security
    impact of this is unclear, since these system calls are usually
    only available to the root user.

CVE-2022-22942

    It was discovered that wrong file file descriptor handling in the
    VMware Virtual GPU driver (vmwgfx) could result in information leak
    or privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-24448

    Lyu Tao reported a flaw in the NFS implementation in the Linux
    kernel when handling requests to open a directory on a regular file,
    which could result in a information leak.

CVE-2022-24959

    A memory leak was discovered in the yam_siocdevprivate() function of
    the YAM driver for AX.25, which could result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-25258

    Szymon Heidrich reported the USB Gadget subsystem lacks certain
    validation of interface OS descriptor requests, resulting in memory
    corruption.

CVE-2022-25375

    Szymon Heidrich reported that the RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation
    of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command, resulting in information
    leak from kernel memory.

isdn: cpai: check ctr->cnr to avoid array index out of boundThe cmtp\_add\_connection() would add a cmtp session to a controller
and run a kernel thread to process cmtp.
\_\_module\_get(THIS\_MODULE);
session->task = kthread\_run(cmtp\_session, session, "kcmtpd\_ctr\_%d",
session->num);
During this process, the kernel thread would call detach\_capi\_ctr()
to detach a register controller. if the controller
was not attached yet, detach\_capi\_ctr() would
trigger an array-index-out-bounds bug.

may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2020-29374

    Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
    management.  A parent and child process initially share all their
    memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
    duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write).  However, in case an
    operation such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an
    additional reference to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs
    during this operation, the kernel might have accessed the wrong
    process's memory.  For some programs, this could lead to an
    information leak or data corruption.

    This issue was already fixed for most architectures, but not on
    MIPS and System z.  This update corrects that.

CVE-2020-36322, CVE-2021-28950

    The syzbot tool found that the FUSE (filesystem-in-user-space)
    implementation did not correctly handle a FUSE server returning
    invalid attributes for a file.  A local user permitted to run a
    FUSE server could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    The original fix for this introduced a different potential denial
    of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has also been
    fixed.

CVE-2021-3640

    Lin Ma discovered a race condiiton in the Bluetooth protocol
    implementation that can lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3744, CVE-2021-3764

    minihanshen reported bugs in the ccp driver for AMD
    Cryptographic Coprocessors that could lead to a resource leak.
    On systems using this driver, a local user could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service.

CVE-2021-3752

    Likang Luo of NSFOCUS Security Team discovered a flaw in the
    Bluetooth L2CAP implementation that can lead to a user-after-free.
    A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3760, CVE-2021-4202

    Lin Ma discovered race conditions in the NCI (NFC Controller
    Interface) driver, which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-3772

    A flaw was found in the SCTP protocol implementation, which would
    allow a networked attacker to break an SCTP association.  The
    attacker would only need to know or guess the IP addresses and
    ports for the association.

CVE-2021-4002

    It was discovered that hugetlbfs, the virtual filesystem used by
    applications to allocate huge pages in RAM, did not flush the
    CPU's TLB in one case where it was necessary.  In some
    circumstances a local user would be able to read and write huge
    pages after they are freed and reallocated to a different process.
    This could lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or
    information leaks.

CVE-2021-4083

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the local (Unix) sockets
    garbage collector, that can lead to use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-4135

    A flaw was found in the netdevsim driver which would lead to an
    information leak.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-4155

    Kirill Tkhai discovered a data leak in the way the XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP
    IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for a size increase of files
    with unaligned size. A local attacker can take advantage of this
    flaw to leak data on the XFS filesystem.

CVE-2021-4203

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the local (Unix) sockets
    implementation that can lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this to leak sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2021-20317

    It was discovered that the timer queue structure could become
    corrupt, leading to waiting tasks never being woken up.  A local
    user with certain privileges could exploit this to cause a denial
    of service (system hang).

CVE-2021-20321

    A race condition was discovered in the overlayfs filesystem
    driver.  A local user with access to an overlayfs mount and to its
    underlying upper directory could exploit this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-20322

    An information leak was discovered in the IPv4 implementation.  A
    remote attacker could exploit this to quickly discover which UDP
    ports a system is using, making it easier for them to carry out a
    DNS poisoning attack against that system.

CVE-2021-22600

    The syzbot tool found a flaw in the packet socket (AF_PACKET)
    implementation which could lead to incorrectly freeing memory.  A
    local user with CAP_NET_RAW capability (in any user namespace)
    could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713 (XSA-391)

    Juergen Gross reported that malicious PV backends can cause a denial
    of service to guests being serviced by those backends via high
    frequency events, even if those backends are running in a less
    privileged environment.

CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715 (XSA-392)

    Juergen Gross discovered that Xen guests can force the Linux
    netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory, resulting in
    denial of service.

CVE-2021-38300

    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a flaw in the classic BPF (cBPF) JIT
    compiler for MIPS architectures.  A local user could exploit
    this to excute arbitrary code in the kernel.

    This issue is mitigated by setting sysctl
    net.core.bpf_jit_enable=0, which is the default.  It is *not*
    mitigated by disabling unprivileged use of eBPF.

CVE-2021-39685

    Szymon Heidrich discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the
    USB gadget subsystem, resulting in information disclosure, denial of
    service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-39686

    A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, that
    could lead to incorrect security checks.  On systems where the
    binder driver is loaded, a local user could exploit this for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-39698

    Linus Torvalds reported a flaw in the file polling implementation,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user could exploit
    this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-39713

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling
    subsystem which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-41864

    An integer overflow was discovered in the Extended BPF (eBPF)
    subsystem.  A local user could exploit this for denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

    This can be mitigated by setting sysctl
    kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1, which disables eBPF use by
    unprivileged users.

CVE-2021-42739

    A heap buffer overflow was discovered in the firedtv driver for
    FireWire-connected DVB receivers.  A local user with access to a
    firedtv device could exploit this for denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-43389

    The Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a flaw in the CMTP
    subsystem as used by Bluetooth, which could lead to an
    out-of-bounds read and object type confusion.  A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in the initial user namespace could
    exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash),
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-43975

    Brendan Dolan-Gavitt reported a flaw in the
    hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait() function in the aQuantia AQtion ethernet
    device driver which can result in denial of service or the execution
    of arbitrary code.

CVE-2021-43976

    Zekun Shen and Brendan Dolan-Gavitt discovered a flaw in the
    mwifiex_usb_recv() function of the Marvell WiFi-Ex USB Driver. An
    attacker able to connect a crafted USB device can take advantage of
    this flaw to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2021-44733

    A race condition was discovered in the Trusted Execution
    Environment (TEE) subsystem for Arm processors, which could lead
    to a use-after-free.  A local user permitted to access a TEE
    device could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-45095

    It was discovered that the Phone Network protocol (PhoNet) driver
    has a reference count leak in the pep_sock_accept() function.

CVE-2021-45469

    Wenqing Liu reported an out-of-bounds memory access in the f2fs
    implementation if an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. An
    attacker able to mount a specially crafted image can take advantage
    of this flaw for denial of service.

CVE-2021-45480

    A memory leak flaw was discovered in the __rds_conn_create()
    function in the RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) protocol subsystem.

CVE-2022-0001 (INTEL-SA-00598)

    Researchers at VUSec discovered that the Branch History Buffer in
    Intel processors can be exploited to create information side-
    channels with speculative execution.  This issue is similar to
    Spectre variant 2, but requires additional mitigations on some
    processors.

    This can be exploited to obtain sensitive information from a
    different security context, such as from user-space to the kernel,
    or from a KVM guest to the kernel.

CVE-2022-0002 (INTEL-SA-00598)

    This is a similar issue to CVE-2022-0001, but covers exploitation
    within a security context, such as from JIT-compiled code in a
    sandbox to hosting code in the same process.

    This can be partly mitigated by disabling eBPF for unprivileged
    users with the sysctl: kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=2.  This
    update does that by default.

CVE-2022-0322

    Eiichi Tsukata discovered a flaw in the sctp_make_strreset_req()
    function in the SCTP network protocol implementation which can
    result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-0330

    Sushma Venkatesh Reddy discovered a missing GPU TLB flush in the
    i915 driver, resulting in denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-0435

    Samuel Page and Eric Dumazet reported a stack overflow in the
    networking module for the Transparent Inter-Process Communication
    (TIPC) protocol, resulting in denial of service or potentially the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2022-0487

    A use-after-free was discovered in the MOXART SD/MMC Host Controller
    support driver. This flaw does not impact the Debian binary packages
    as CONFIG_MMC_MOXART is not set.

CVE-2022-0492

    Yiqi Sun and Kevin Wang reported that the cgroup-v1 subsystem does
    not properly restrict access to the release-agent feature. A local
    user can take advantage of this flaw for privilege escalation and
    bypass of namespace isolation.

CVE-2022-0617

    butt3rflyh4ck discovered a NULL pointer dereference in the UDF
    filesystem. A local user that can mount a specially crafted UDF
    image can use this flaw to crash the system.

CVE-2022-0644

    Hao Sun reported a missing check for file read permission in the
    finit_module() and kexec_file_load() system calls.  The security
    impact of this is unclear, since these system calls are usually
    only available to the root user.

CVE-2022-22942

    It was discovered that wrong file file descriptor handling in the
    VMware Virtual GPU driver (vmwgfx) could result in information leak
    or privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-24448

    Lyu Tao reported a flaw in the NFS implementation in the Linux
    kernel when handling requests to open a directory on a regular file,
    which could result in a information leak.

CVE-2022-24959

    A memory leak was discovered in the yam_siocdevprivate() function of
    the YAM driver for AX.25, which could result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-25258

    Szymon Heidrich reported the USB Gadget subsystem lacks certain
    validation of interface OS descriptor requests, resulting in memory
    corruption.

CVE-2022-25375

    Szymon Heidrich reported that the RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation
    of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command, resulting in information
    leak from kernel memory.

# Linux kernel: isdn: cpai: array-index-out-of-bounds in detach\_capi\_ctr in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c

```
Hi, there is an array-index-out-bounds bug in detach_capi_ctr in
drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c and I reproduce it on 5.15.0-rc2+.

#Root Cause
we can call CMTPCONNADD ioctl and it would invoke
do_cmtp_sock_ioctl(), it would call cmtp_add_connection().
The chain of call is as follows.
ioctl(CMTPCONNADD)
   ->cmtp_sock_ioctl()
         -->do_cmtp_sock_ioctl()
            --->cmtp_add_connection()
                ---->kthread_run()
                ---->cmtp_attach_device()
the function would add a cmtp session to a controller.

The cmtp_add_connection() would add a cmtp session to a controller
and run a kernel thread to process cmtp.

        __module_get(THIS_MODULE);
        session->task = kthread_run(cmtp_session, session, "kcmtpd_ctr_%d",
                                                                session->num);

During this process, the kernel thread would call detach_capi_ctr()
to detach a register controller. if the controller
was not attached yet, detach_capi_ctr() would
trigger an array-index-out-bounds bug.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 349 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2880220.1).

**Please note that since the release of the April 2022 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released a Security Alert for Oracle E-Business Suite [CVE-2022-21500 (May 19, 2022)](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2022-21500.html). Customers are strongly advised to apply the July 2022 Critical Patch Update for Oracle E-Business Suite, which includes patches for this Alert as well as additional patches.**

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

Subject: [There is an array-index-out-bounds bug in detach_capi_ctr in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c](#r)
Date: Fri, 24 Sep 2021 16:44:21 +0800	[[thread overview]](#r)
Message-ID: <CAFcO6XOvGQrRTaTkaJ0p3zR7y7nrAWD79r48=L_BbOyrK9X-vA@mail.gmail.com> (<raw>)

Hi, there is an array-index-out-bounds bug in detach_capi_ctr in
drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c and I reproduce it on 5.15.0-rc2+.

###Analyze
 we can call CMTPCONNADD ioctl and it would invoke
do_cmtp_sock_ioctl(), it would call cmtp_add_connection().
the chain of call is as follows.
ioctl(CMTPCONNADD)
   ->cmtp_sock_ioctl()
         -->do_cmtp_sock_ioctl()
            --->cmtp_add_connection()
                ---->kthread_run()
                ---->cmtp_attach_device()
the function would add a cmtp session to a controller. Let us see the code.
```
int cmtp_add_connection(struct cmtp_connadd_req *req, struct socket *sock)
{
u32 valid_flags = BIT(CMTP_LOOPBACK);
struct cmtp_session *session, *s;
int i, err;

BT_DBG("");

if (!l2cap_is_socket(sock))
return -EBADFD;

if (req->flags & ~valid_flags)
return -EINVAL;

session = kzalloc(sizeof(struct cmtp_session), GFP_KERNEL);   ///
alloc and clear struct cmtp_session 'session' by kzalloc().
if (!session)
return -ENOMEM;

[...]

session->task = kthread_run(cmtp_session, session,
"kcmtpd_ctr_%d",session->num); ///  create and run a kernel thread
invoke cmtp_session() and the args is 'session'

[...]

if (!(session->flags & BIT(CMTP_LOOPBACK))) {
err = cmtp_attach_device(session);   ///   invoke cmtp_attach_device()
to attach a session with a controller.
if (err < 0) {
/* Caller will call fput in case of failure, and so
* will cmtp_session kthread.
*/
get_file(session->sock->file);

atomic_inc(&session->terminate);
wake_up_interruptible(sk_sleep(session->sock->sk));
up_write(&cmtp_session_sem);
return err;
}
}
[...]

```
the struct cmtp_session have a member named struct capi_ctr 'ctrl'.
struct capi_ctr have a member named 'cnr', it is controller number.

the kernel thread would invoke cmtp_session(), it would call
cmtp_detach_device() to detach a session and the registration of a
controller.
cmtp_session()
     ->cmtp_detach_device()
          ->detach_capi_ctr()
let us see detach_capi_ctr() function implement.
```
int detach_capi_ctr(struct capi_ctr *ctr)
{
int err = 0;

mutex_lock(&capi_controller_lock);

ctr_down(ctr, CAPI_CTR_DETACHED);

if (capi_controller[ctr->cnr - 1] != ctr) {   /// use
cmtp_session->capi_ctr->cnr
err = -EINVAL;
goto unlock_out;
}
capi_controller[ctr->cnr - 1] = NULL;
ncontrollers--;

[...]

```
If the cmtp_add_connection() call cmtp_attach_device() not yet, the
cmtp_session->capi_ctr->cnr just is an ZERO.

The capi_controller[-1] make no sense. so should check that the
cmtp_session->capi_ctr->cnr is not an ZERO.

                 CVE-2021-43389

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, or information
leaks.

CVE-2020-3702

    A flaw was found in the driver for Atheros IEEE 802.11n family of
    chipsets (ath9k) allowing information disclosure.

CVE-2020-16119

    Hadar Manor reported a use-after-free in the DCCP protocol
    implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker can take
    advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service or potentially
    to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2021-0920

    A race condition was discovered in the local sockets (AF_UNIX)
    subsystem, which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3612

    Murray McAllister reported a flaw in the joystick input subsystem.
    A local user permitted to access a joystick device could exploit
    this to read and write out-of-bounds in the kernel, which could
    be used for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3653

   Maxim Levitsky discovered a vulnerability in the KVM hypervisor
   implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel: Missing
   validation of the `int_ctl` VMCB field could allow a malicious L1
   guest to enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt
   Controller) for the L2 guest. The L2 guest can take advantage of
   this flaw to write to a limited but still relatively large subset
   of the host physical memory.

CVE-2021-3655

    Ilja Van Sprundel and Marcelo Ricardo Leitner found multiple flaws
    in the SCTP implementation, where missing validation could lead to
    an out-of-bounds read.  On a system using SCTP, a networked
    attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-3679

    A flaw in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality could
    allow a privileged local user (with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) to
    cause a denial of service (resource starvation).

CVE-2021-3732

    Alois Wohlschlager reported a flaw in the implementation of the
    overlayfs subsystem, allowing a local attacker with privileges to
    mount a filesystem to reveal files hidden in the original mount.

CVE-2021-3753

    Minh Yuan reported a race condition in the vt_k_ioctl in
    drivers/tty/vt/vt_ioctl.c, which may cause an out of bounds read
    in vt.

CVE-2021-3760

    Lin Horse reported a flaw in the NCI (NFC Controller Interface)
    driver, which could lead to a use-after-free.

    However, this driver is not included in the binary packages
    provided by Debian.

CVE-2021-20317

    It was discovered that the timer queue structure could become
    corrupt, leading to waiting tasks never being woken up.  A local
    user with certain privileges could exploit this to cause a denial
    of service (system hang).

CVE-2021-20321

    A race condition was discovered in the overlayfs filesystem
    driver.  A local user with access to an overlayfs mount and to its
    underlying upper directory could exploit this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-20322

    An information leak was discovered in the IPv4 implementation.  A
    remote attacker could exploit this to quickly discover which UDP
    ports a system is using, making it easier for them to carry out a
    DNS poisoning attack against that system.

CVE-2021-22543

    David Stevens discovered a flaw in how the KVM hypervisor maps
    host memory into a guest.  A local user permitted to access
    /dev/kvm could use this to cause certain pages to be freed when
    they should not, leading to a use-after-free.  This could be used
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-37159

    A flaw was discovered in the hso driver for Option mobile
    broadband modems.  An error during initialisation could lead to a
    double-free or use-after-free.  An attacker able to plug in USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly to run arbitrary code.

CVE-2021-38160

    A flaw in the virtio_console was discovered allowing data
    corruption or data loss by an untrusted device.

CVE-2021-38198

    A flaw was discovered in the KVM implementation for x86
    processors, that could result in virtual memory protection within
    a guest not being applied correctly.  When shadow page tables are
    used - i.e. for nested virtualisation, or on CPUs lacking the EPT
    or NPT feature - a user of the guest OS might be able to exploit
    this for denial of service or privilege escalation within the
    guest.

CVE-2021-38199

    Michael Wakabayashi reported a flaw in the NFSv4 client
    implementation, where incorrect connection setup ordering allows
    operations of a remote NFSv4 server to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2021-38204

    A flaw was discovered in the max4321-hcd USB host controller
    driver, which could lead to a use-after-free.

    However, this driver is not included in the binary packages
    provided by Debian.

CVE-2021-38205

    An information leak was discovered in the xilinx_emaclite network
    driver.  On a custom kernel where this driver is enabled and used,
    this might make it easier to exploit other kernel bugs.

CVE-2021-40490

    A race condition was discovered in the ext4 subsystem when writing
    to an inline_data file while its xattrs are changing. This could
    result in denial of service.

CVE-2021-41864

    An integer overflow was discovered in the Extended BPF (eBPF)
    subsystem.  A local user could exploit this for denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

    This can be mitigated by setting sysctl
    kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1, which disables eBPF use by
    unprivileged users.

CVE-2021-42008

    A heap buffer overflow was discovered in the 6pack serial port
    network driver.  A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could
    exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash), or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-42739

    A heap buffer overflow was discovered in the firedtv driver for
    FireWire-connected DVB receivers.  A local user with access to a
    firedtv device could exploit this for denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-43389

    The Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a flaw in the CMTP
    subsystem as used by Bluetooth, which could lead to an
    out-of-bounds read and object type confusion.  A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in the initial user namespace could
    exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash),
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.290-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Subject: [There is an array-index-out-bounds bug in detach_capi_ctr in drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c](#r)
Date: Fri, 24 Sep 2021 16:44:21 +0800	[[thread overview]](#r)
Message-ID: <CAFcO6XOvGQrRTaTkaJ0p3zR7y7nrAWD79r48=L_BbOyrK9X-vA@mail.gmail.com> (<raw>)

Hi, there is an array-index-out-bounds bug in detach_capi_ctr in
drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c and I reproduce it on 5.15.0-rc2+.

###Analyze
 we can call CMTPCONNADD ioctl and it would invoke
do_cmtp_sock_ioctl(), it would call cmtp_add_connection().
the chain of call is as follows.
ioctl(CMTPCONNADD)
   ->cmtp_sock_ioctl()
         -->do_cmtp_sock_ioctl()
            --->cmtp_add_connection()
                ---->kthread_run()
                ---->cmtp_attach_device()
the function would add a cmtp session to a controller. Let us see the code.
```
int cmtp_add_connection(struct cmtp_connadd_req *req, struct socket *sock)
{
u32 valid_flags = BIT(CMTP_LOOPBACK);
struct cmtp_session *session, *s;
int i, err;

BT_DBG("");

if (!l2cap_is_socket(sock))
return -EBADFD;

if (req->flags & ~valid_flags)
return -EINVAL;

session = kzalloc(sizeof(struct cmtp_session), GFP_KERNEL);   ///
alloc and clear struct cmtp_session 'session' by kzalloc().
if (!session)
return -ENOMEM;

[...]

session->task = kthread_run(cmtp_session, session,
"kcmtpd_ctr_%d",session->num); ///  create and run a kernel thread
invoke cmtp_session() and the args is 'session'

[...]

if (!(session->flags & BIT(CMTP_LOOPBACK))) {
err = cmtp_attach_device(session);   ///   invoke cmtp_attach_device()
to attach a session with a controller.
if (err < 0) {
/* Caller will call fput in case of failure, and so
* will cmtp_session kthread.
*/
get_file(session->sock->file);

atomic_inc(&session->terminate);
wake_up_interruptible(sk_sleep(session->sock->sk));
up_write(&cmtp_session_sem);
return err;
}
}
[...]

```
the struct cmtp_session have a member named struct capi_ctr 'ctrl'.
struct capi_ctr have a member named 'cnr', it is controller number.

the kernel thread would invoke cmtp_session(), it would call
cmtp_detach_device() to detach a session and the registration of a
controller.
cmtp_session()
     ->cmtp_detach_device()
          ->detach_capi_ctr()
let us see detach_capi_ctr() function implement.
```
int detach_capi_ctr(struct capi_ctr *ctr)
{
int err = 0;

mutex_lock(&capi_controller_lock);

ctr_down(ctr, CAPI_CTR_DETACHED);

if (capi_controller[ctr->cnr - 1] != ctr) {   /// use
cmtp_session->capi_ctr->cnr
err = -EINVAL;
goto unlock_out;
}
capi_controller[ctr->cnr - 1] = NULL;
ncontrollers--;

[...]

```
If the cmtp_add_connection() call cmtp_attach_device() not yet, the
cmtp_session->capi_ctr->cnr just is an ZERO.

The capi_controller[-1] make no sense. so should check that the
cmtp_session->capi_ctr->cnr is not an ZERO.

pinctrl: stm32: use valid pin identifier in stm32\_pinctrl\_resume()
commit c370bb474016ab9edfdabd7c08a88dd13a71ddbd upstream.
When resuming from low power, the driver attempts to restore the
configuration of some pins. This is done by a call to:
stm32\_pinctrl\_restore\_gpio\_regs(struct stm32\_pinctrl \*pctl, u32 pin)
where 'pin' must be a valid pin value (i.e. matching some 'groups->pin').
Fix the current implementation which uses some wrong 'pin' value.

ARM: 9122/1: select HAVE\_FUTEX\_CMPXCHG
commit 9d417cbe36eee7afdd85c2e871685f8dab7c2dba upstream.
tglx notes:
This function [futex\_detect\_cmpxchg] is only needed when an
architecture has to runtime discover whether the CPU supports it or
not. ARM has unconditional support for this, so the obvious thing to
do is the below.
Fixes linkage failure from Clang randconfigs:
kernel/futex.o:(.text.fixup+0x5c): relocation truncated to fit: R\_ARM\_JUMP24 against `.init.text'
and boot failures for CONFIG\_THUMB2\_KERNEL.

net: mdiobus: Fix memory leak in \_\_mdiobus\_register
commit ab609f25d19858513919369ff3d9a63c02cd9e2e upstream.
Once device\_register() failed, we should call put\_device() to
decrement reference count for cleanup. Or it will cause memory
leak.

bpf, test, cgroup: Use sk\_{alloc,free} for test cases
commit 435b08ec0094ac1e128afe6cfd0d9311a8c617a7 upstream.
BPF test infra has some hacks in place which kzalloc() a socket and perform
minimum init via sock\_net\_set() and sock\_init\_data(). As a result, the sk's
skcd->cgroup is NULL since it didn't go through proper initialization as it
would have been the case from sk\_alloc(). Rather than re-adding a NULL test
in sock\_cgroup\_ptr() just for this, use sk\_{alloc,free}() pair for the test
socket. The latter also allows to get rid of the bpf\_sk\_storage\_free() special
case.

s390/pci: fix zpci\_zdev\_put() on reserve
commit a46044a92add6a400f4dada7b943b30221f7cc80 upstream.
Since commit 2a671f77ee49 ("s390/pci: fix use after free of zpci\_dev")
the reference count of a zpci\_dev is incremented between
pcibios\_add\_device() and pcibios\_release\_device() which was supposed to
prevent the zpci\_dev from being freed while the common PCI code has
access to it. It was missed however that the handling of zPCI
availability events assumed that once zpci\_zdev\_put() was called no
later availability event would still see the device. With the previously
mentioned commit however this assumption no longer holds and we must
make sure that we only drop the initial long-lived reference the zPCI
subsystem holds exactly once.
Do so by introducing a zpci\_device\_reserved() function that handles when
a device is reserved. Here we make sure the zpci\_dev will not be
considered for further events by removing it from the zpci\_list.
This also means that the device actually stays in the
ZPCI\_FN\_STATE\_RESERVED state between the time we know it has been
reserved and the final reference going away. We thus need to consider it
a real state instead of just a conceptual state after the removal. The
final cleanup of PCI resources, removal from zbus, and destruction of
the IOMMU stays in zpci\_release\_device() to make sure holders of the
reference do see valid data until the release.

It's currently safe to call zpci\_cleanup\_bus\_resources() even if the

zdev->has\_resources before we call zpci\_cleanup\_bus\_resources() in

After commit ea2f0f77538c ("scsi: core: Cap scsi\_host cmd\_per\_lun at

hv\_storvsc driver sets scsi\_driver.can\_queue to an integer value that

shost->cmd\_per\_lun to a negative "short" value.

autofs: fix wait name hash calculation in autofs\_wait()
commit 25f54d08f12feb593e62cc2193fedefaf7825301 upstream.
There's a mistake in commit 2be7828c9fefc ("get rid of autofs\_getpath()")
that affects kernels from v5.13.0, basically missed because of me not
fully testing the change for Al.
The problem is that the hash calculation for the wait name qstr hasn't
been updated to account for the change to use dentry\_path\_raw(). This
prevents the correct matching an existing wait resulting in multiple
notifications being sent to the daemon for the same mount which must
not occur.
The problem wasn't discovered earlier because it only occurs when
multiple processes trigger a request for the same mount concurrently
so it only shows up in more aggressive testing.

rx unused desc is the desc that need attatching new buffer
before refilling to hw to receive new packet, the number of
desc need attatching new buffer is calculated using next\_to\_use
and next\_to\_clean. when next\_to\_use == next\_to\_clean, currently
hns3 driver assumes that all the desc has the buffer attatched,
but 'next\_to\_use == next\_to\_clean' also means all the desc need
attatching new buffer if hw has comsumed all the desc and the
driver has not attatched any buffer to the desc yet.
This patch adds 'refill' in desc\_cb to indicate whether a new
buffer has been refilled to a desc.

Input: snvs\_pwrkey - add clk handling
[ Upstream commit d997cc1715df7b6c3df798881fb9941acf0079f8 ]
On i.MX7S and i.MX8M\* (but not i.MX6\*) the pwrkey device has an
associated clock. Accessing the registers requires that this clock is
enabled. Binding the driver on at least i.MX7S and i.MX8MP while not
having the clock enabled results in a complete hang of the machine.
(This usually only happens if snvs\_pwrkey is built as a module and the
rtc-snvs driver isn't already bound because at bootup the required clk
is on and only gets disabled when the clk framework disables unused clks
late during boot.)
This completes the fix in commit 135be16d3505 ("ARM: dts: imx7s: add
snvs clock to pwrkey").

spi-mux: Fix false-positive lockdep splats
[ Upstream commit 16a8e2fbb2d49111004efc1c7342e083eafabeb0 ]
io\_mutex is taken by spi\_setup() and spi-mux's .setup() callback calls
spi\_setup() which results in a nested lock of io\_mutex.
add\_lock is taken by spi\_add\_device(). The device\_add() call in there
can result in calling spi-mux's .probe() callback which registers its
own spi controller which in turn results in spi\_add\_device() being
called again.
To fix this initialize the controller's locks already in
spi\_alloc\_controller() to give spi\_mux\_probe() a chance to set the
lockdep subclass.

spi: Fix deadlock when adding SPI controllers on SPI buses
[ Upstream commit 6098475d4cb48d821bdf453c61118c56e26294f0 ]
Currently we have a global spi\_add\_lock which we take when adding new
devices so that we can check that we're not trying to reuse a chip
select that's already controlled. This means that if the SPI device is
itself a SPI controller and triggers the instantiation of further SPI
devices we trigger a deadlock as we try to register and instantiate
those devices while in the process of doing so for the parent controller
and hence already holding the global spi\_add\_lock. Since we only care
about concurrency within a single SPI bus move the lock to be per
controller, avoiding the deadlock.
This can be easily triggered in the case of spi-mux.

ALSA: hda: avoid write to STATESTS if controller is in reset
[ Upstream commit b37a15188eae9d4c49c5bb035e0c8d4058e4d9b3 ]
The snd\_hdac\_bus\_reset\_link() contains logic to clear STATESTS register
before performing controller reset. This code dates back to an old
bugfix in commit e8a7f136f5ed ("[ALSA] hda-intel - Improve HD-audio
codec probing robustness"). Originally the code was added to
azx\_reset().
The code was moved around in commit a41d122449be ("ALSA: hda - Embed bus
into controller object") and ended up to snd\_hdac\_bus\_reset\_link() and
called primarily via snd\_hdac\_bus\_init\_chip().
The logic to clear STATESTS is correct when snd\_hdac\_bus\_init\_chip() is
called when controller is not in reset. In this case, STATESTS can be
cleared. This can be useful e.g. when forcing a controller reset to retry
codec probe. A normal non-power-on reset will not clear the bits.
However, this old logic is problematic when controller is already in
reset. The HDA specification states that controller must be taken out of
reset before writing to registers other than GCTL.CRST (1.0a spec,
3.3.7). The write to STATESTS in snd\_hdac\_bus\_reset\_link() will be lost
if the controller is already in reset per the HDA specification mentioned.
This has been harmless on older hardware. On newer generation of Intel
PCIe based HDA controllers, if configured to report issues, this write
will emit an unsupported request error. If ACPI Platform Error Interface
(APEI) is enabled in kernel, this will end up to kernel log.
Fix the code in snd\_hdac\_bus\_reset\_link() to only clear the STATESTS if
the function is called when controller is not in reset. Otherwise
clearing the bits is not possible and should be skipped.

btrfs: deal with errors when checking if a dir entry exists during log replay

Currently inode\_in\_dir() ignores errors returned from
btrfs\_lookup\_dir\_index\_item() and from btrfs\_lookup\_dir\_item(), treating
any errors as if the directory entry does not exists in the fs/subvolume
tree, which is obviously not correct, as we can get errors such as -EIO
when reading extent buffers while searching the fs/subvolume's tree.

caller, add\_inode\_ref(), deal with returned errors as well.

ALSA: hda: intel: Allow repeatedly probing on codec configuration errors
[ Upstream commit c0f1886de7e173865f1a0fa7680a1c07954a987f ]
It seems that a few recent AMD systems show the codec configuration
errors at the early boot, while loading the driver at a later stage
works magically. Although the root cause of the error isn't clear,
it's certainly not bad to allow retrying the codec probe in such a
case if that helps.
This patch adds the capability for retrying the probe upon codec probe
errors on the certain AMD platforms. The probe\_work is changed to a
delayed work, and at the secondary call, it'll jump to the codec
probing.
Note that, not only adding the re-probing, this includes the behavior
changes in the codec configuration function. Namely,
snd\_hda\_codec\_configure() won't unregister the codec at errors any
longer. Instead, its caller, azx\_codec\_configure() unregisters the
codecs with the probe failures \*if\* any codec has been successfully
configured. If all codec probe failed, it doesn't unregister but let
it re-probed -- which is the most case we're seeing and this patch
tries to improve.
Even if the driver doesn't re-probe or give up, it will go to the
"free-all" error path, hence the leftover codecs shall be disabled /
deleted in anyway.

objtool: Update section header before relocations
[ Upstream commit 86e1e054e0d2105cf32b0266cf1a64e6c26424f7 ]
The libelf implementation from elftoolchain has a safety check in
gelf\_update\_rel[a] to check that the data corresponds to a section
that has type SHT\_REL[A] [0]. If the relocation is updated before
the section header is updated with the proper type, this check
fails.
To fix this, update the section header first, before the relocations.
Previously, the section size was calculated in elf\_rebuild\_reloc\_section
by counting the number of entries in the reloc\_list. However, we
now need the size during elf\_write so instead keep a running total
and add to it for every new relocation.

drm: mxsfb: Fix NULL pointer dereference crash on unload
commit 3cfc183052c3dbf8eae57b6c1685dab00ed3db4a upstream.
The mxsfb->crtc.funcs may already be NULL when unloading the driver,
in which case calling mxsfb\_irq\_disable() via drm\_irq\_uninstall() from
mxsfb\_unload() leads to NULL pointer dereference.
Since all we care about is masking the IRQ and mxsfb->base is still
valid, just use that to clear and mask the IRQ.

net: bridge: mcast: use multicast\_membership\_interval for IGMPv3
commit fac3cb82a54a4b7c49c932f96ef196cf5774344c upstream.
When I added IGMPv3 support I decided to follow the RFC for computing
the GMI dynamically:
" 8.4. Group Membership Interval
The Group Membership Interval is the amount of time that must pass
before a multicast router decides there are no more members of a
group or a particular source on a network.
This value MUST be ((the Robustness Variable) times (the Query
Interval)) plus (one Query Response Interval)."
But that actually is inconsistent with how the bridge used to compute it
for IGMPv2, where it was user-configurable that has a correct default value
but it is up to user-space to maintain it. This would make it consistent
with the other timer values which are also maintained correct by the user
instead of being dynamically computed. It also changes back to the previous
user-expected GMI behaviour for IGMPv3 queries which were supported before
IGMPv3 was added. Note that to properly compute it dynamically we would
need to add support for "Robustness Variable" which is currently missing.

isdn: cpai: check ctr->cnr to avoid array index out of bound
commit 1f3e2e97c003f80c4b087092b225c8787ff91e4d upstream.
The cmtp\_add\_connection() would add a cmtp session to a controller
and run a kernel thread to process cmtp.
\_\_module\_get(THIS\_MODULE);
session->task = kthread\_run(cmtp\_session, session, "kcmtpd\_ctr\_%d",
session->num);
During this process, the kernel thread would call detach\_capi\_ctr()
to detach a register controller. if the controller
was not attached yet, detach\_capi\_ctr() would
trigger an array-index-out-bounds bug.

KVM: x86: split the two parts of emulator\_pio\_in
commit 3b27de27183911d461afedf50c6fa30c59740c07 upstream.
emulator\_pio\_in handles both the case where the data is pending in
vcpu->arch.pio.count, and the case where I/O has to be done via either
an in-kernel device or a userspace exit. For SEV-ES we would like
to split these, to identify clearly the moment at which the
sev\_pio\_data is consumed. To this end, create two different
functions: \_\_emulator\_pio\_in fills in vcpu->arch.pio.count, while
complete\_emulator\_pio\_in clears it and releases vcpu->arch.pio.data.
Because this patch has to be backported, things are left a bit messy.
kernel\_pio() operates on vcpu->arch.pio, which leads to emulator\_pio\_in()
having with two calls to complete\_emulator\_pio\_in(). It will be fixed
in the next release.
While at it, remove the unused void\* val argument of emulator\_pio\_in\_out.
The function currently hardcodes vcpu->arch.pio\_data as the
source/destination buffer, which sucks but will be fixed after the more
severe SEV-ES buffer overflow.
No functional change intended.

KVM: SEV-ES: go over the sev\_pio\_data buffer in multiple passes if needed
commit 95e16b4792b0429f1933872f743410f00e590c55 upstream.
The PIO scratch buffer is larger than a single page, and therefore
it is not possible to copy it in a single step to vcpu->arch/pio\_data.
Bound each call to emulator\_pio\_in/out to a single page; keep
track of how many I/O operations are left in vcpu->arch.sev\_pio\_count,
so that the operation can be restarted in the complete\_userspace\_io
callback.
For OUT, this means that the previous kvm\_sev\_es\_outs implementation
becomes an iterator of the loop, and we can consume the sev\_pio\_data
buffer before leaving to userspace.
For IN, instead, consuming the buffer and decreasing sev\_pio\_count
is always done in the complete\_userspace\_io callback, because that
is when the memcpy is done into sev\_pio\_data.

commit ea724ea420aac58b41bc822d1aed6940b136b78d upstream.
A few very small cleanups to the functions, smushed together because
the patch is already very small like this:
- inline emulator\_pio\_in\_emulated and emulator\_pio\_out\_emulated,
since we already have the vCPU
- remove the data argument and pull setting vcpu->arch.sev\_pio\_data into
the caller
- remove unnecessary clearing of vcpu->arch.pio.count when
emulation is done by the kernel (and therefore vcpu->arch.pio.count
is already clear on exit from emulator\_pio\_in and emulator\_pio\_out).

Since commit c300ab9f08df ("KVM: x86: Replace late check\_nested\_events() hack with

tries to inject an external interrupt vmexit to L1 on every call to vcpu\_enter\_guest.

that inject\_pending\_event() is called, and from there kvm\_check\_nested\_events().

commit 899447f669da76cc3605665e1a95ee877bc464cc upstream.
If object's reuse is delayed, it will be excluded from the reconstructed
freelist. But we forgot to adjust the cnt accordingly. So there will
be a mismatch between reconstructed freelist depth and cnt. This will
lead to free\_debug\_processing() complaining about freelist count or a
incorrect slub inuse count.

powerpc/idle: Don't corrupt back chain when going idle
commit 496c5fe25c377ddb7815c4ce8ecfb676f051e9b6 upstream.
In isa206\_idle\_insn\_mayloss() we store various registers into the stack
red zone, which is allowed.
However inside the IDLE\_STATE\_ENTER\_SEQ\_NORET macro we save r2 again,
to 0(r1), which corrupts the stack back chain.
We used to do the same in isa206\_idle\_insn\_mayloss() itself, but we
fixed that in 73287caa9210 ("powerpc64/idle: Fix SP offsets when saving
GPRs"), however we missed that the macro also corrupts the back chain.
Corrupting the back chain is bad for debuggability but doesn't
necessarily cause a bug.
However we recently changed the stack handling in some KVM code, and it
now relies on the stack back chain being valid when it returns. The
corruption causes that code to return with r1 pointing somewhere in
kernel data, at some point LR is restored from the stack and we branch
to NULL or somewhere else invalid.
Only affects Power8 hosts running KVM guests, with dynamic\_mt\_modes
enabled (which it is by default).
The fixes tag below points to the commit that changed the KVM stack
handling, exposing this bug. The actual corruption of the back chain has
always existed since 948cf67c4726 ("powerpc: Add NAP mode support on
Power7 in HV mode").

KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Make idle\_kvm\_start\_guest() return 0 if it went to guest
commit cdeb5d7d890e14f3b70e8087e745c4a6a7d9f337 upstream.
We call idle\_kvm\_start\_guest() from power7\_offline() if the thread has
been requested to enter KVM. We pass it the SRR1 value that was returned
from power7\_idle\_insn() which tells us what sort of wakeup we're
processing.
Depending on the SRR1 value we pass in, the KVM code might enter the
guest, or it might return to us to do some host action if the wakeup
requires it.
If idle\_kvm\_start\_guest() is able to handle the wakeup, and enter the
guest it is supposed to indicate that by returning a zero SRR1 value to
us.
That was the behaviour prior to commit 10d91611f426 ("powerpc/64s:
Reimplement book3s idle code in C"), however in that commit the
handling of SRR1 was reworked, and the zeroing behaviour was lost.
Returning from idle\_kvm\_start\_guest() without zeroing the SRR1 value can
confuse the host offline code, causing the guest to crash and other
weirdness.

KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix stack handling in idle\_kvm\_start\_guest()
commit 9b4416c5095c20e110c82ae602c254099b83b72f upstream.
In commit 10d91611f426 ("powerpc/64s: Reimplement book3s idle code in
C") kvm\_start\_guest() became idle\_kvm\_start\_guest(). The old code
allocated a stack frame on the emergency stack, but didn't use the
frame to store anything, and also didn't store anything in its caller's
frame.
idle\_kvm\_start\_guest() on the other hand is written more like a normal C
function, it creates a frame on entry, and also stores CR/LR into its
callers frame (per the ABI). The problem is that there is no caller
frame on the emergency stack.
The emergency stack for a given CPU is allocated with:
paca\_ptrs[i]->emergency\_sp = alloc\_stack(limit, i) + THREAD\_SIZE;
So emergency\_sp actually points to the first address above the emergency
stack allocation for a given CPU, we must not store above it without
first decrementing it to create a frame. This is different to the
regular kernel stack, paca->kstack, which is initialised to point at an
initial frame that is ready to use.
idle\_kvm\_start\_guest() stores the backchain, CR and LR all of which
write outside the allocation for the emergency stack. It then creates a
stack frame and saves the non-volatile registers. Unfortunately the
frame it creates is not large enough to fit the non-volatiles, and so
the saving of the non-volatile registers also writes outside the
emergency stack allocation.
The end result is that we corrupt whatever is at 0-24 bytes, and 112-248
bytes above the emergency stack allocation.
In practice this has gone unnoticed because the memory immediately above
the emergency stack happens to be used for other stack allocations,
either another CPUs mc\_emergency\_sp or an IRQ stack. See the order of
calls to irqstack\_early\_init() and emergency\_stack\_init().
The low addresses of another stack are the top of that stack, and so are
only used if that stack is under extreme pressue, which essentially
never happens in practice - and if it did there's a high likelyhood we'd
crash due to that stack overflowing.
Still, we shouldn't be corrupting someone else's stack, and it is purely
luck that we aren't corrupting something else.
To fix it we save CR/LR into the caller's frame using the existing r1 on
entry, we then create a SWITCH\_FRAME\_SIZE frame (which has space for
pt\_regs) on the emergency stack with the backchain pointing to the
existing stack, and then finally we switch to the new frame on the
emergency stack.

ucounts: Fix signal ucount refcounting
commit 15bc01effefe97757ef02ca09e9d1b927ab22725 upstream.
In commit fda31c50292a ("signal: avoid double atomic counter
increments for user accounting") Linus made a clever optimization to
how rlimits and the struct user\_struct. Unfortunately that
optimization does not work in the obvious way when moved to nested
rlimits. The problem is that the last decrement of the per user
namespace per user sigpending counter might also be the last decrement
of the sigpending counter in the parent user namespace as well. Which
means that simply freeing the leaf ucount in \_\_free\_sigqueue is not
enough.
Maintain the optimization and handle the tricky cases by introducing
inc\_rlimit\_get\_ucounts and dec\_rlimit\_put\_ucounts.
By moving the entire optimization into functions that perform all of
the work it becomes possible to ensure that every level is handled
properly.
The new function inc\_rlimit\_get\_ucounts returns 0 on failure to
increment the ucount. This is different than inc\_rlimit\_ucounts which
increments the ucounts and returns LONG\_MAX if the ucount counter has
exceeded it's maximum or it wrapped (to indicate the counter needs to
decremented).
I wish we had a single user to account all pending signals to across
all of the threads of a process so this complexity was not necessary

ucounts: Move get\_ucounts from cred\_alloc\_blank to key\_change\_session\_keyring
commit 5ebcbe342b1c12fae44b4f83cbeae1520e09857e upstream.
Setting cred->ucounts in cred\_alloc\_blank does not make sense. The
uid and user\_ns are deliberately not set in cred\_alloc\_blank but
instead the setting is delayed until key\_change\_session\_keyring.
So move dealing with ucounts into key\_change\_session\_keyring as well.
Unfortunately that movement of get\_ucounts adds a new failure mode to
key\_change\_session\_keyring. I do not see anything stopping the parent
process from calling setuid and changing the relevant part of it's
cred while keyctl\_session\_to\_parent is running making it fundamentally
necessary to call get\_ucounts in key\_change\_session\_keyring. Which
means that the new failure mode cannot be avoided.
A failure of key\_change\_session\_keyring results in a single threaded
parent keeping it's existing credentials. Which results in the parent
process not being able to access the session keyring and whichever
keys are in the new keyring.
Further get\_ucounts is only expected to fail if the number of bits in
the refernece count for the structure is too few.
Since the code has no other way to report the failure of get\_ucounts
and because such failures are not expected to be common add a WARN\_ONCE
to report this problem to userspace.
Between the WARN\_ONCE and the parent process not having access to
the keys in the new session keyring I expect any failure of get\_ucounts
will be noticed and reported and we can find another way to handle this
condition. (Possibly by just making ucounts->count an atomic\_long\_t).

commit 5af82c81b2c49cfb1cad84d9eb6eab0e3d1c4842 upstream.
The put callback of a kcontrol is supposed to return 1 when the value
is changed, and this will be notified to user-space. However, some
DAPM kcontrols always return 0 (except for errors), hence the
user-space misses the update of a control value.
This patch corrects the behavior by properly returning 1 when the
value gets updated.

mm/mempolicy: do not allow illegal MPOL\_F\_NUMA\_BALANCING | MPOL\_LOCAL in mbind()
commit 6d2aec9e123bb9c49cb5c7fc654f25f81e688e8c upstream.
syzbot reported access to unitialized memory in mbind() [1]
Issue came with commit bda420b98505 ("numa balancing: migrate on fault
among multiple bound nodes")
This commit added a new bit in MPOL\_MODE\_FLAGS, but only checked valid
combination (MPOL\_F\_NUMA\_BALANCING can only be used with MPOL\_BIND) in
do\_set\_mempolicy()
This patch moves the check in sanitize\_mpol\_flags() so that it is also
used by mbind()

userfaultfd: fix a race between writeprotect and exit\_mmap()
commit cb185d5f1ebf900f4ae3bf84cee212e6dd035aca upstream.
A race is possible when a process exits, its VMAs are removed by
exit\_mmap() and at the same time userfaultfd\_writeprotect() is called.
The race was detected by KASAN on a development kernel, but it appears
to be possible on vanilla kernels as well.
Use mmget\_not\_zero() to prevent the race as done in other userfaultfd
operations.

mm/userfaultfd: selftests: fix memory corruption with thp enabled
commit 8913970c19915bbe773d97d42989cd85b7fdc098 upstream.
In RHEL's gating selftests we've encountered memory corruption in the
uffd event test even with upstream kernel:
# ./userfaultfd anon 128 4

testing uffd-wp with pagemap (pgsize=2097152): done
testing events (fork, remap, remove): ERROR: nr 32427 memory corruption 0 1 (errno=0, line=963)
ERROR: faulting process failed (errno=0, line=1117)
It can be easily reproduced when global thp enabled, which is the
default for RHEL.
It's also known as a side effect of commit 0db282ba2c12 ("selftest: use
mmap instead of posix\_memalign to allocate memory", 2021-07-23), which
is imho right itself on using mmap() to make sure the addresses will be
untagged even on arm.
The problem is, for each test we allocate buffers using two
allocate\_area() calls. We assumed these two buffers won't affect each
other, however they could, because mmap() could have found that the two
buffers are near each other and having the same VMA flags, so they got
merged into one VMA.
It won't be a big problem if thp is not enabled, but when thp is
agressively enabled it means when initializing the src buffer it could
accidentally setup part of the dest buffer too when there's a shared THP
that overlaps the two regions. Then some of the dest buffer won't be
able to be trapped by userfaultfd missing mode, then it'll cause memory
corruption as described.
To fix it, do release\_pages() after initializing the src buffer.
Since the previous two release\_pages() calls are after
uffd\_test\_ctx\_clear() which will unmap all the buffers anyway (which is
stronger than release pages; as unmap() also tear town pgtables), drop
them as they shouldn't really be anything useful.
We can mark the Fixes tag upon 0db282ba2c12 as it's reported to only
happen there, however the real "Fixes" IMHO should be 8ba6e8640844, as
before that commit we'll always do explicit release\_pages() before
registration of uffd, and 8ba6e8640844 changed that logic by adding
extra unmap/map and we didn't release the pages at the right place.
Meanwhile I don't have a solid glue anyway on whether posix\_memalign()
could always avoid triggering this bug, hence it's safer to attach this
fix to commit 8ba6e8640844.

ocfs2: mount fails with buffer overflow in strlen
commit b15fa9224e6e1239414525d8d556d824701849fc upstream.
Starting with kernel 5.11 built with CONFIG\_FORTIFY\_SOURCE mouting an
ocfs2 filesystem with either o2cb or pcmk cluster stack fails with the
trace below. Problem seems to be that strings for cluster stack and
cluster name are not guaranteed to be null terminated in the disk
representation, while strlcpy assumes that the source string is always
null terminated. This causes a read outside of the source string
triggering the buffer overflow detection.

ocfs2: fix data corruption after conversion from inline format
commit 5314454ea3ff6fc746eaf71b9a7ceebed52888fa upstream.
Commit 6dbf7bb55598 ("fs: Don't invalidate page buffers in
block\_write\_full\_page()") uncovered a latent bug in ocfs2 conversion
from inline inode format to a normal inode format.
The code in ocfs2\_convert\_inline\_data\_to\_extents() attempts to zero out
the whole cluster allocated for file data by grabbing, zeroing, and
dirtying all pages covering this cluster. However these pages are
beyond i\_size, thus writeback code generally ignores these dirty pages
and no blocks were ever actually zeroed on the disk.
This oversight was fixed by commit 693c241a5f6a ("ocfs2: No need to zero
pages past i\_size.") for standard ocfs2 write path, inline conversion
path was apparently forgotten; the commit log also has a reasoning why
the zeroing actually is not needed.
After commit 6dbf7bb55598, things became worse as writeback code stopped
invalidating buffers on pages beyond i\_size and thus these pages end up
with clean PageDirty bit but with buffers attached to these pages being
still dirty. So when a file is converted from inline format, then
writeback triggers, and then the file is grown so that these pages
become valid, the invalid dirtiness state is preserved,
mark\_buffer\_dirty() does nothing on these pages (buffers are already
dirty) but page is never written back because it is clean. So data
written to these pages is lost once pages are reclaimed.
Simple reproducer for the problem is:
xfs\_io -f -c "pwrite 0 2000" -c "pwrite 2000 2000" -c "fsync" \
-c "pwrite 4000 2000" ocfs2\_file
After unmounting and mounting the fs again, you can observe that end of
'ocfs2\_file' has lost its contents.
Fix the problem by not doing the pointless zeroing during conversion
from inline format similarly as in the standard write path.

tracing: Have all levels of checks prevent recursion
commit ed65df63a39a3f6ed04f7258de8b6789e5021c18 upstream.
While writing an email explaining the "bit = 0" logic for a discussion on
making ftrace\_test\_recursion\_trylock() disable preemption, I discovered a
path that makes the "not do the logic if bit is zero" unsafe.
The recursion logic is done in hot paths like the function tracer. Thus,
any code executed causes noticeable overhead. Thus, tricks are done to try
to limit the amount of code executed. This included the recursion testing
logic.
Having recursion testing is important, as there are many paths that can
end up in an infinite recursion cycle when tracing every function in the
kernel. Thus protection is needed to prevent that from happening.
Because it is OK to recurse due to different running context levels (e.g.
an interrupt preempts a trace, and then a trace occurs in the interrupt
handler), a set of bits are used to know which context one is in (normal,
softirq, irq and NMI). If a recursion occurs in the same level, it is
prevented\*.
Then there are infrastructure levels of recursion as well. When more than
one callback is attached to the same function to trace, it calls a loop
function to iterate over all the callbacks. Both the callbacks and the
loop function have recursion protection. The callbacks use the
"ftrace\_test\_recursion\_trylock()" which has a "function" set of context
bits to test, and the loop function calls the internal
trace\_test\_and\_set\_recursion() directly, with an "internal" set of bits.
If an architecture does not implement all the features supported by ftrace
then the callbacks are never called directly, and the loop function is
called instead, which will implement the features of ftrace.
Since both the loop function and the callbacks do recursion protection, it
was seemed unnecessary to do it in both locations. Thus, a trick was made
to have the internal set of recursion bits at a more significant bit
location than the function bits. Then, if any of the higher bits were set,
the logic of the function bits could be skipped, as any new recursion
would first have to go through the loop function.
This is true for architectures that do not support all the ftrace
features, because all functions being traced must first go through the
loop function before going to the callbacks. But this is not true for
architectures that support all the ftrace features. That's because the
loop function could be called due to two callbacks attached to the same
function, but then a recursion function inside the callback could be
called that does not share any other callback, and it will be called
directly.
i.e.
traced\_function\_1: [ more than one callback tracing it ]
call loop\_func
loop\_func:
trace\_recursion set internal bit
call callback
callback:
trace\_recursion [ skipped because internal bit is set, return 0 ]
call traced\_function\_2
traced\_function\_2: [ only traced by above callback ]
call callback
callback:
trace\_recursion [ skipped because internal bit is set, return 0 ]
call traced\_function\_2
[ wash, rinse, repeat, BOOM! out of shampoo! ]
Thus, the "bit == 0 skip" trick is not safe, unless the loop function is
call for all functions.
Since we want to encourage architectures to implement all ftrace features,
having them slow down due to this extra logic may encourage the
maintainers to update to the latest ftrace features. And because this
logic is only safe for them, remove it completely.
[\*] There is on layer of recursion that is allowed, and that is to allow
for the transition between interrupt context (normal -> softirq ->
irq -> NMI), because a trace may occur before the context update is
visible to the trace recursion logic.

ceph: fix handling of "meta" errors
commit 1bd85aa65d0e7b5e4d09240f492f37c569fdd431 upstream.
Currently, we check the wb\_err too early for directories, before all of
the unsafe child requests have been waited on. In order to fix that we
need to check the mapping->wb\_err later nearer to the end of ceph\_fsync.
We also have an overly-complex method for tracking errors after
blocklisting. The errors recorded in cleanup\_session\_requests go to a
completely separate field in the inode, but we end up reporting them the
same way we would for any other error (in fsync).
There's no real benefit to tracking these errors in two different
places, since the only reporting mechanism for them is in fsync, and
we'd need to advance them both every time.
Given that, we can just remove i\_meta\_err, and convert the places that
used it to instead just use mapping->wb\_err instead. That also fixes
the original problem by ensuring that we do a check\_and\_advance of the
wb\_err at the end of the fsync op.

ceph: skip existing superblocks that are blocklisted or shut down when mounting
commit 98d0a6fb7303a6f4a120b8b8ed05b86ff5db53e8 upstream.
Currently when mounting, we may end up finding an existing superblock
that corresponds to a blocklisted MDS client. This means that the new
mount ends up being unusable.
If we've found an existing superblock with a client that is already
blocklisted, and the client is not configured to recover on its own,
fail the match. Ditto if the superblock has been forcibly unmounted.
While we're in here, also rename "other" to the more conventional "fsc".

can: j1939: j1939\_tp\_rxtimer(): fix errant alert in j1939\_tp\_rxtimer
commit b504a884f6b5a77dac7d580ffa08e482f70d1a30 upstream.
When the session state is J1939\_SESSION\_DONE, j1939\_tp\_rxtimer() will
give an alert "rx timeout, send abort", but do nothing actually. Move
the alert into session active judgment condition, it is more
reasonable.
One of the scenarios is that j1939\_tp\_rxtimer() execute followed by
j1939\_xtp\_rx\_abort\_one(). After j1939\_xtp\_rx\_abort\_one(), the session
state is J1939\_SESSION\_DONE, then j1939\_tp\_rxtimer() give an alert.

can: isotp: isotp\_sendmsg(): fix TX buffer concurrent access in isotp\_sendmsg()
commit 43a08c3bdac4cb42eff8fe5e2278bffe0c5c3daa upstream.
When isotp\_sendmsg() concurrent, tx.state of all TX processes can be
ISOTP\_IDLE. The conditions so->tx.state != ISOTP\_IDLE and
wq\_has\_sleeper(&so->wait) can not protect TX buffer from being
accessed by multiple TX processes.
We can use cmpxchg() to try to modify tx.state to ISOTP\_SENDING firstly.
If the modification of the previous process succeed, the later process
must wait tx.state to ISOTP\_IDLE firstly. Thus, we can ensure TX buffer
is accessed by only one process at the same time. And we should also
restore the original tx.state at the subsequent error processes.

can: isotp: isotp\_sendmsg(): fix return error on FC timeout on TX path
commit d674a8f123b4096d85955c7eaabec688f29724c9 upstream.
When the a large chunk of data send and the receiver does not send a
Flow Control frame back in time, the sendmsg() does not return a error
code, but the number of bytes sent corresponding to the size of the
packet.
If a timeout occurs the isotp\_tx\_timer\_handler() is fired, sets
sk->sk\_err and calls the sk->sk\_error\_report() function. It was
wrongly expected that the error would be propagated to user space in
every case. For isotp\_sendmsg() blocking on wait\_event\_interruptible()
this is not the case.
This patch fixes the problem by checking if sk->sk\_err is set and
returning the error to user space.

net: enetc: make sure all traffic classes can send large frames
[ Upstream commit e378f4967c8edd64c680f2e279cb646ee06b6f2d ]
The enetc driver does not implement .ndo\_change\_mtu, instead it
configures the MAC register field PTC{Traffic Class}MSDUR[MAXSDU]
statically to a large value during probe time.
The driver used to configure only the max SDU for traffic class 0, and
that was fine while the driver could only use traffic class 0. But with
the introduction of mqprio, sending a large frame into any other TC than
0 is broken.
This patch fixes that by replicating per traffic class the static
configuration done in enetc\_configure\_port\_mac().

net/mlx5e: IPsec: Fix work queue entry ethernet segment checksum flags
[ Upstream commit 1d000323940137332d4d62c6332b6daf5f07aba7 ]
Current Work Queue Entry (WQE) checksum (csum) flags in the ethernet
segment (eseg) in case of IPsec crypto offload datapath are not aligned
with PRM/HW expectations.
Currently the driver always sets the l3\_inner\_csum flag in case of IPsec
because of the wrong usage of skb->encapsulation as indicator for inner
IPsec header since skb->encapsulation is always ON for IPsec packets
since IPsec itself is an encapsulation protocol. The above forced a
failing attempts of calculating csum of non-existing segments (like in
the IP|ESP|TCP packet case which does not have an l3\_inner) which led
to lots of packet drops hence the low throughput.
Fix by using xo->inner\_ipproto as indicator for inner IPsec header
instead of skb->encapsulation in addition to setting the csum flags
as following:
\* Tunnel Mode:
\* Pkt: MAC IP ESP IP L4
\* CSUM: l3\_cs | l3\_inner\_cs | l4\_inner\_cs
\*
\* Transport Mode:
\* Pkt: MAC IP ESP L4
\* CSUM: l3\_cs [ | l4\_cs (checksum partial case)]
\*
\* Tunnel(VXLAN TCP/UDP) over Transport Mode
\* Pkt: MAC IP ESP UDP VXLAN IP L4

net/mlx5e: IPsec: Fix a misuse of the software parser's fields
[ Upstream commit d10457f85d4ae4d32c0df0cd65358a78c577fbe6 ]
IPsec crypto offload current Software Parser (SWP) fields settings in
the ethernet segment (eseg) are not aligned with PRM/HW expectations.
Among others in case of IP|ESP|TCP packet, current driver sets the
offsets for inner\_l3 and inner\_l4 although there is no inner l3/l4
headers relative to ESP header in such packets.
SWP provides the offsets for HW ,so it can be used to find csum fields
to offload the checksum, however these are not necessarily used by HW
and are used as fallback in case HW fails to parse the packet, e.g
when performing IPSec Transport Aware (IP | ESP | TCP) there is no
need to add SW parse on inner packet. So in some cases packets csum
was calculated correctly , whereas in other cases it failed. The later
faced csum errors (caused by wrong packet length calculations) which
led to lots of packet drops hence the low throughput.
Fix by setting the SWP fields as expected in a IP|ESP|TCP packet.
the following describe the expected SWP offsets:
\* Tunnel Mode:
\* SWP: OutL3 InL3 InL4
\* Pkt: MAC IP ESP IP L4
\*
\* Transport Mode:
\* SWP: OutL3 OutL4
\* Pkt: MAC IP ESP L4

However, the value of hdev->reset\_pending may also be assigned by
the interrupt function hclgevf\_misc\_irq\_handle(), which may cause the
loop fail to exit and keep occupying the workqueue. This loop is not
necessary, so remove it and the workqueue will be rescheduled if the
reset needs to be retried or a new reset occurs.

net: hns3: schedule the polling again when allocation fails
[ Upstream commit 68752b24f51a71d4f350a764d890b670f59062c5 ]
Currently when there is a rx page allocation failure, it is
possible that polling may be stopped if there is no more packet
to be reveiced, which may cause queue stall problem under memory
pressure.
This patch makes sure polling is scheduled again when there is
any rx page allocation failure, and polling will try to allocate
receive buffers until it succeeds.
Now the allocation retry is added, it is unnecessary to do the rx
page allocation at the end of rx cleaning, so remove it. And reset
the unused\_count to zero after calling hns3\_nic\_alloc\_rx\_buffers()
to avoid calling hns3\_nic\_alloc\_rx\_buffers() repeatedly under
memory pressure.

net: hns3: reset DWRR of unused tc to zero
[ Upstream commit b63fcaab959807282e9822e659034edf95fc8bd1 ]
Currently, DWRR of tc will be initialized to a fixed value when this tc
is enabled, but it is not been reset to 0 when this tc is disabled. It
cause a problem that the DWRR of unused tc is not 0 after using tc tool
to add and delete multi-tc parameters.
For examples, after enabling 4 TCs and restoring to 1 TC by follow
tc commands:
$ tc qdisc add dev eth0 root mqprio num\_tc 4 map 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 queues \
8@0 8@8 8@16 8@24 hw 1 mode channel
$ tc qdisc del dev eth0 root
Now there is just one TC is enabled for eth0, but the tc info querying by
debugfs is shown as follow:

powerpc/smp: do not decrement idle task preempt count in CPU offline
[ Upstream commit 787252a10d9422f3058df9a4821f389e5326c440 ]
With PREEMPT\_COUNT=y, when a CPU is offlined and then onlined again, we
get:
BUG: scheduling while atomic: swapper/1/0/0x00000000
no locks held by swapper/1/0.
CPU: 1 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/1 Not tainted 5.15.0-rc2+ #100

cpu\_startup\_entry+0x38/0x40
start\_secondary+0x2ec/0x3a0
start\_secondary\_prolog+0x10/0x14
This is because powerpc's arch\_cpu\_idle\_dead() decrements the idle task's
preempt count, for reasons explained in commit a7c2bb8279d2 ("powerpc:
Re-enable preemption before cpu\_die()"), specifically "start\_secondary()
expects a preempt\_count() of 0."
However, since commit 2c669ef6979c ("powerpc/preempt: Don't touch the idle
task's preempt\_count during hotplug") and commit f1a0a376ca0c ("sched/core:
Initialize the idle task with preemption disabled"), that justification no
longer holds.
The idle task isn't supposed to re-enable preemption, so remove the
vestigial preempt\_enable() from the CPU offline path.
Tested with pseries and powernv in qemu, and pseries on PowerVM.

tcp: md5: Fix overlap between vrf and non-vrf keys
[ Upstream commit 86f1e3a8489f6a0232c1f3bc2bdb379f5ccdecec ]
With net.ipv4.tcp\_l3mdev\_accept=1 it is possible for a listen socket to
accept connection from the same client address in different VRFs. It is
also possible to set different MD5 keys for these clients which differ
only in the tcpm\_l3index field.
This appears to work when distinguishing between different VRFs but not
between non-VRF and VRF connections. In particular:
\* tcp\_md5\_do\_lookup\_exact will match a non-vrf key against a vrf key.
This means that adding a key with l3index != 0 after a key with l3index
== 0 will cause the earlier key to be deleted. Both keys can be present
if the non-vrf key is added later.
\* \_tcp\_md5\_do\_lookup can match a non-vrf key before a vrf key. This
casues failures if the passwords differ.
Fix this by making tcp\_md5\_do\_lookup\_exact perform an actual exact
comparison on l3index and by making \_\_tcp\_md5\_do\_lookup perfer
vrf-bound keys above other considerations like prefixlen.

In rt\_mt6(), when it's a nonlinear skb, the 1st skb\_header\_pointer()
only copies sizeof(struct ipv6\_rt\_hdr) to \_route that rh points to.
The access by ((const struct rt0\_hdr \*)rh)->reserved will overflow
the buffer. So this access should be moved below the 2nd call to
skb\_header\_pointer().
Besides, after the 2nd skb\_header\_pointer(), its return value should
also be checked, othersize, \*rp may cause null-pointer-ref.
v1->v2:
- clean up some old debugging log.

There are many features in the driver that depend on the major, minor,
and patch version of the FW. Without the patch number in the output for
fw.mgmt.api debugging issues related to the FW API version is difficult.
Also, using major.minor.patch aligns with the existing firmware version
which uses a 3 digit value.
Fix this by making the fw.mgmt.api print the major.minor.patch

ice: Avoid crash from unnecessary IDA free
[ Upstream commit 73e30a62b19b9fbb4e6a3465c59da186630d5f2e ]
In the remove path, there is an attempt to free the aux\_idx IDA whether
it was allocated or not. This can potentially cause a crash when
unloading the driver on systems that do not initialize support for RDMA.
But, this free cannot be gated by the status bit for RDMA, since it is
allocated if the driver detects support for RDMA at probe time, but the
driver can enter into a state where RDMA is not supported after the IDA
has been allocated at probe time and this would lead to a memory leak.
Initialize aux\_idx to an invalid value and check for a valid value when
unloading to determine if an IDA free is necessary.

ice: Fix failure to re-add LAN/RDMA Tx queues
[ Upstream commit ff7e93219442f5ac5b2cfd33e4fe4b7d5942f957 ]
Currently if the VSI is rebuilt/removed and the RDMA PF driver is active
the RDMA Tx queue scheduler node configuration will not be cleaned up.
This will cause the rebuild/re-add of the VSI to fail due to the
software structures not being correctly cleaned up for the VSI index.
Fix this by always calling ice\_rm\_vsi\_rdma\_cfg() for all VSI. If there
are no RDMA scheduler nodes created, then there is no harm in calling
ice\_rm\_vsi\_rdma\_cfg(). This change applies to all VSI types, so if
RDMA support is added for other VSI types they will also get this
change.

ASoC: wm8960: Fix clock configuration on slave mode
[ Upstream commit 6b9b546dc00797c74bef491668ce5431ff54e1e2 ]
There is a noise issue for 8kHz sample rate on slave mode.
Compared with master mode, the difference is the DACDIV
setting, after correcting the DACDIV, the noise is gone.
There is no noise issue for 48kHz sample rate, because
the default value of DACDIV is correct for 48kHz.
So wm8960\_configure\_clocking() should be functional for
ADC and DAC function even if it is slave mode.
In order to be compatible for old use case, just add
condition for checking that sysclk is zero with
slave mode.

dma-debug: fix sg checks in debug\_dma\_map\_sg()
[ Upstream commit 293d92cbbd2418ca2ba43fed07f1b92e884d1c77 ]
The following warning occurred sporadically on s390:
DMA-API: nvme 0006:00:00.0: device driver maps memory from kernel text or rodata [addr=0000000048cc5e2f] [len=131072]
WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 825 at kernel/dma/debug.c:1083 check\_for\_illegal\_area+0xa8/0x138
It is a false-positive warning, due to broken logic in debug\_dma\_map\_sg().
check\_for\_illegal\_area() checks for overlay of sg elements with kernel text
or rodata. It is called with sg\_dma\_len(s) instead of s->length as
parameter. After the call to ->map\_sg(), sg\_dma\_len() will contain the
length of possibly combined sg elements in the DMA address space, and not
the individual sg element length, which would be s->length.
The check will then use the physical start address of an sg element, and
add the DMA length for the overlap check, which could result in the false
warning, because the DMA length can be larger than the actual single sg
element length.
In addition, the call to check\_for\_illegal\_area() happens in the iteration
over mapped\_ents, which will not include all individual sg elements if
any of them were combined in ->map\_sg().
Fix this by using s->length instead of sg\_dma\_len(s). Also put the call to
check\_for\_illegal\_area() in a separate loop, iterating over all the
individual sg elements ("nents" instead of "mapped\_ents").
While at it, as suggested by Robin Murphy, also move check\_for\_stack()
inside the new loop, as it is similarly concerned with validating the
individual sg elements.

base hook. Notifier attempts to do this again.
The need to do base hook unregister unconditionally was needed in the past,
because notifier was last stage where reg->dev dereference was safe.
Now that nf\_tables does the hook removal in .pre\_exit, this isn't
needed anymore.

Currently, when the rule related to IDLETIMER is added, idletimer\_tg timer

kernel panic. So, this commit fixes the panic by initializing
timer->timer\_type using kzalloc instead of kmalloc.

KVM: arm64: Fix host stage-2 PGD refcount
[ Upstream commit 1d58a17ef54599506d44c45ac95be27273a4d2b1 ]
The KVM page-table library refcounts the pages of concatenated stage-2
PGDs individually. However, when running KVM in protected mode, the
host's stage-2 PGD is currently managed by EL2 as a single high-order
compound page, which can cause the refcount of the tail pages to reach 0
when they shouldn't, hence corrupting the page-table.
Fix this by introducing a new hyp\_split\_page() helper in the EL2 page
allocator (matching the kernel's split\_page() function), and make use of
it from host\_s2\_zalloc\_pages\_exact().

is:
pcm512x 0-004c: Failed to set data format: -16
And after that, no sound.
This fix is not 100% correct. The datasheet of at least the pcm5142
states that four bits (0xcc) in the I2S\_1 register are "RSV"
("Reserved. Do not access.") and no hint is given as to what the
initial values are supposed to be. So, specifying defaults for
these bits is wrong. But perhaps better than a broken driver?

entry/exit") when encountering BPF\_NOSPEC.
Mitigations are enabled depending on what the firmware advertises. In
particular, we do not gate these mitigations based on current settings,
just like in x86. Due to this, we don't need to take any action if
mitigations are enabled or disabled at runtime.

NFSD: Keep existing listeners on portlist error
[ Upstream commit c20106944eb679fa3ab7e686fe5f6ba30fbc51e5 ]
If nfsd has existing listening sockets without any processes, then an error
returned from svc\_create\_xprt() for an additional transport will remove
those existing listeners. We're seeing this in practice when userspace
attempts to create rpcrdma transports without having the rpcrdma modules
present before creating nfsd kernel processes. Fix this by checking for
existing sockets before calling nfsd\_destroy().

xtensa: xtfpga: Try software restart before simulating CPU reset
[ Upstream commit 012e974501a270d8dfd4ee2039e1fdf7579c907e ]
Rebooting xtensa images loaded with the '-kernel' option in qemu does
not work. When executing a reboot command, the qemu session either hangs
or experiences an endless sequence of error messages.
Kernel panic - not syncing: Unrecoverable error in exception handler
Reset code jumps to the CPU restart address, but Linux can not recover
from there because code and data in the kernel init sections have been
discarded and overwritten at this point.
XTFPGA platforms have a means to reset the CPU by writing 0xdead into a
specific FPGA IO address. When used in QEMU the kernel image loaded with
the '-kernel' option gets restored to its original state allowing the
machine to boot successfully.
Use that mechanism to attempt a platform reset. If it does not work,
fall back to the existing mechanism.

r8152: avoid to resubmit rx immediately
[ Upstream commit baf33d7a75642b4b38a87fdf1cd96b506df4849f ]
For the situation that the disconnect event comes very late when the
device is unplugged, the driver would resubmit the RX bulk transfer
after getting the callback with -EPROTO immediately and continually.
Finally, soft lockup occurs.
This patch avoids to resubmit RX immediately. It uses a workqueue to
schedule the RX NAPI. And the NAPI would resubmit the RX. It let the
disconnect event have opportunity to stop the submission before soft
lockup.

xen/x86: prevent PVH type from getting clobbered
[ Upstream commit 9172b5c4a778da1f855b2e3780b1afabb3cfd523 ]
Like xen\_start\_flags, xen\_domain\_type gets set before .bss gets cleared.
Hence this variable also needs to be prevented from getting put in .bss,
which is possible because XEN\_NATIVE is an enumerator evaluating to
zero. Any use prior to init\_hvm\_pv\_info() setting the variable again
would lead to wrong decisions; one such case is xenboot\_console\_setup()
when called as a result of "earlyprintk=xen".
Use \_\_ro\_after\_init as more applicable than either \_\_section(".data") or
\_\_read\_mostly.
