{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when creating a new user. Specifically, the 'username' parameter is vulnerable to stored XSS.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the user list page. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code by sending a POST request to the `/users` endpoint with a crafted `username` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to create a new user account on the vulnerable application. This typically requires authentication as an administrator or a user with sufficient privileges to access the user creation functionality. The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable endpoint."
