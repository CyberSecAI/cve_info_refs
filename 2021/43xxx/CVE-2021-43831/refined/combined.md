# Files on the host computer can be accessed from the Gradio interface

## Package

pip

gradio
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<2.4.8

## Patched versions

2.5.0

## Description

### Impact

This is a vulnerability that affects anyone who creates and publicly shares Gradio interfaces using `gradio<2.4.8`. Because of the way that static files were being served, someone who generated a public Gradio link and shared it with others would potentially be exposing the files on the computer that generated the link, while the link was active. An attacker would be able to view the contents of a file on the computer if they knew the exact relative filepath. We do not have any evidence that this was ever exploited, but we treated the issue seriously and immediately took steps to mitigate it (see below)

### Response

1. We worked with [@haby0](https://github.com/haby0) to immediately patch the issue and released a new version, `gradio 2.5.0`, within 24 hours of the issue being brought to our attention
2. We enabled a notification that is printed to anyone using an older version of gradio telling them to upgrade (see screenshot below)
3. We expanded our test suite to test for this vulnerability ensuring that our patch does not get reverted in future releases of `gradio`

### Patches

The problem has been patched in `gradio>=2.5.0`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
