Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43509:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `view_service.php` page of the Simple Client Management System version 1.0.
*   The application directly uses user-supplied input from the `id` GET parameter in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   Specifically, the code executes a query like: `SELECT * FROM \`services_list\` where  id = '{$_GET['id']}'`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The direct inclusion of the unsanitized user input within the SQL query makes it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code to extract sensitive information from the database, including the database name and potentially other data. The provided example demonstrates how to extract the database name.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation**: Depending on database configuration and application implementation, successful SQL injection can lead to further impact such as data manipulation and possibly even remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted GET request to the vulnerable page (`/cms/admin/maintenance/view_service.php`) with a malicious `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated user, meaning the attacker does not need to log in or have any special privileges.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided proof-of-concept (POC) uses a `UNION ALL SELECT` statement to inject SQL code.
    *   The malicious `id` parameter: `9999' union all select null,null,concat(database()),null,null,null,null--+`
    *   This injected SQL will return the database name in the `Description` field in the page HTML response.
* The application returns a 200 OK response code even if there's a SQL error.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content also mentions another related CVE, CVE-2021-43510, which is an SQL injection authentication bypass, but is separate from the scope of CVE-2021-43509.
*   The vulnerable software is "Simple Client Management System V1.0" developed by Oretnom23, available on sourcecodester.com.
*   The exploit was tested on Apache2+MariaDB latest version.

In summary, CVE-2021-43509 allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform SQL injection via the `id` parameter in `view_service.php` which can lead to database information disclosure.
