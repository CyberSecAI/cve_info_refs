The provided content describes two distinct vulnerabilities in the `online-shopping-system`: SQL Injection and Arbitrary File Upload.

**SQL Injection**
*   **Root cause:** The `p` parameter on the `/product.php` page does not sanitize user input, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Unsanitized user input leading to SQL injection vulnerability, specifically boolean-based blind, error-based, time-based blind and UNION query SQL injection
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the underlying MySQL database.
*   **Attack vectors:**  By manipulating the `p` parameter in the URL.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be unauthenticated, and needs to access the `/product.php` page.

**Arbitrary File Upload**
*   **Root cause:** The `add_products` function only verifies the `Content-Type` header but doesn't properly validate file content allowing the attacker to upload arbitrary files by modifying Content-Type
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**  Inadequate file upload validation, specifically insufficient checks on the actual file content allowing the attacker to bypass the `Content-Type` check
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can upload malicious files (e.g., PHP shell), potentially leading to remote code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:** By uploading a file with a modified Content-Type through the `add_products` functionality.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the `add_products` functionality, the required authentication level is unclear from this document.
