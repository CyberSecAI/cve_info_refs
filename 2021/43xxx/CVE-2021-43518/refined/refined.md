{
  "CVE-2021-43518": {
    "Description": "Teeworlds up to and including 0.7.5 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow. A map parser does not validate m_Channels value coming from a map file, leading to a buffer overflow. A malicious server may offer a specially crafted map that will overwrite client's stack causing denial of service or code execution.",
    "Root cause": "The `CMapLayers::LoadEnvPoints` function does not validate the `m_Channels` value from a map file, which leads to writing outside the bounds of the stack allocated array `p.m_aValues`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-120",
      "Stack buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious server can send a crafted map file that triggers a stack buffer overflow on the client. This can lead to denial of service or arbitrary code execution on the client machine. Specifically, the vulnerability allows overwriting the instruction pointer and execution of arbitrary code.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious server delivers a crafted map file to a client.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control a game server that can send a malicious map to clients connecting to it."
