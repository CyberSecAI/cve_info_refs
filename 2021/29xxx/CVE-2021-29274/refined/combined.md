To reproduce

1. Create one issue with a subject like `Test <select> tag`

Result

* We should display something like `Feature #xxxx Test <select> tag`
* We display a `select` object rendered in the tip, like image bellow

Thank you for fixing the issue but I see `<span>` tags when using auto-complete by issue subject.

Please try this new version, it should work as expected with one mention: the letters that match the search are no longer highlighted.

Also, instead of the `sanitzeHTML` function, I think it's better to use a library like <https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#escape>, but I'm not sure how to add it without copying the code or by using a module bundler like webpack. @Jean-Philippe, any recommendations on this?

By the way: this a full-blown XSS vulnerability. With an issue subject such as

```

<span onmouseover="alert('pwned');">This is some exciting text</span>

```

arbitrary Javascript can be executed (as well as arbitrary HTML code shown). In my opinion, the assessment of the issue in [Security\_Advisories](/projects/redmine/wiki/Security_Advisories) should therefore be increased to High.
