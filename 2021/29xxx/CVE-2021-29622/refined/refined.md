Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-29622:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a bug in the Prometheus code that handles redirects within the `/new` endpoint. This endpoint was introduced to ensure a smooth transition to the new UI, where URLs prefixed with `/new` redirect to `/`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Open Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is an open redirect. An attacker can craft a special URL within the `/new` endpoint that, due to a coding flaw, redirects a user to an arbitrary URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can redirect a user to a malicious website by crafting a specific URL using the vulnerable `/new` endpoint. This could be used to perform phishing attacks, steal credentials, or deliver malware.
- The impact is considered moderate, with potential compromise of confidentiality and integrity, but not availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based.
- An attacker needs to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to induce a user to click on the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to craft URLs.
- The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to click the crafted URL pointing to a vulnerable Prometheus server.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable URL pattern is `/new/new<url>`. For example, `http://127.0.0.1:9090/new/newhttp://www.google.com/` will redirect the user to `http://google.com`.
- The vulnerability is present in Prometheus versions greater than or equal to 2.23.0 and less than 2.26.1, as well as version 2.27.0.
- The vulnerability was patched in versions 2.26.1 and 2.27.1. The /new endpoint is being removed in version 2.28.0.
- A workaround is to disable access to /new via a reverse proxy in front of Prometheus.
- Prometheus instances that use the `--web.external-url` flag *with a path* are not affected.

**CVSS Metrics:**
-   CVSS v3 Base Score: 6.1
-   Attack Vector: Network
-   Attack Complexity: Low
-   Privileges Required: None
-   User Interaction: Required
-   Scope: Changed
-   Confidentiality Impact: Low
