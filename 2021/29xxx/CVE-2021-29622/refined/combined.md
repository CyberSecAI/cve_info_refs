This release contains a bug fix for a security issue in the API endpoint. An

attacker can craft a special URL that redirects a user to any endpoint via an

HTTP 302 response. See the [security advisory](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/security/advisories/GHSA-vx57-7f4q-fpc7) for more details.

This vulnerability has been reported by Aaron Devaney from MDSec.

# Open Redirect under the /new endpoint

Moderate

[csmarchbanks](/csmarchbanks)
published
GHSA-vx57-7f4q-fpc7
May 18, 2021

## Package

prometheus

## Affected versions

> 2.23.0 < 2.26.1, 2.27.0

## Patched versions

2.26.1, 2.27.1

## Description

### Impact

In 2.23.0, Prometheus changed its default UI to the New ui. To ensure a seamless transition, the URL's prefixed by /new redirect to /.

Due to a bug in the code, it is possible for an attacker to craft an URL that can redirect to any other URL, in the /new endpoint.

If a user visits a prometheus server with a specially crafted address (e.g.: `http://127.0.0.1:9090/new/new<url>`), they can be redirected to an arbitrary URL.

e.g. if a user visits [http://127.0.0.1:9090/new/newhttp://www.google.com/](http://127.0.0.1:9090/new/newhttp%3A//www.google.com/), they will be redirected to <http://google.com>.

### Patches

The issue will be patched in 2.26.1 and 2.27.1 releases.

In 2.28.0, the /new endpoint will be removed completely.

### Workarounds

The workaround is to disable access to /new via a reverse proxy in front of Prometheus.

Note: Users who use a `--web.external-url=` flag *with a path* (e.g. `--web.external-url=http://example.com/prometheus`) are not affected.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please use our community channels (<https://prometheus.io/community>).

Our security policy is available at <https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/security/>

[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-vx57-7f4q-fpc7/dependabot)

## Package

gomod

github.com/prometheus/prometheus
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

>= 2.23.0, < 2.26.1
= 2.27.0

## Patched versions

2.26.1
2.27.1

## Description

### Impact

In 2.23.0, Prometheus changed its default UI to the New ui. To ensure a seamless transition, the URL's prefixed by /new redirect to /.

Due to a bug in the code, it is possible for an attacker to craft an URL that can redirect to any other URL, in the /new endpoint.

If a user visits a prometheus server with a specially crafted address (e.g.: `http://127.0.0.1:9090/new/new<url>`), they can be redirected to an arbitrary URL.

e.g. if a user visits [http://127.0.0.1:9090/new/newhttp://www.google.com/](http://127.0.0.1:9090/new/newhttp%3A//www.google.com/), they will be redirected to <http://google.com>.

### Patches

The issue will be patched in 2.26.1 and 2.27.1 releases.

In 2.28.0, the /new endpoint will be removed completely.

### Workarounds

The workaround is to disable access to /new via a reverse proxy in front of Prometheus.

Note: Users who use a `--web.external-url=` flag *with a path* (e.g. `--web.external-url=http://example.com/prometheus`) are not affected.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
