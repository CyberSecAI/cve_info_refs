The provided content relates to CVE-2021-29520.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Missing validation between arguments to `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackprop*` operations. Specifically, the implementation assumes that the `input`, `filter_sizes` and `out_backprop` tensors have the same shape, which is not validated.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow due to lack of shape validation in `Conv3DBackpropInputV2` and `Conv3DBackpropFilterV2` operations.
- Out-of-bounds read can occur with crafted inputs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Heap buffer overflow, potentially leading to crashes or other undefined behavior, possibly arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing specifically crafted inputs to the `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackprop*` operations with mismatched shapes, an attacker could trigger the vulnerability.
- This is demonstrated with sample code snippets that cause the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the inputs (input_sizes, filter_tensor, out_backprop) to the vulnerable TensorFlow operations and execute them. This could be through a model that uses these operations or any other means to invoke the API.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was patched in commit `8f37b52e1320d8d72a9529b2468277791a261197`, which adds shape validation to the relevant operations.
- The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0 and was also cherry-picked into versions 2.4.2, 2.3.3, 2.2.3, and 2.1.4.
- The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 2.5.0
