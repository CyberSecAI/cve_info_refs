        "vulnerability_details": {
          "root_cause": "The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/sys_config_valid.xgi` endpoint, where the `exeshell` parameter allows execution of arbitrary shell commands due to insufficient input validation.",
           "weaknesses": [
              "Remote Command Execution vulnerability",
              "Insecure parameter handling"
            ],
          "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected router with root privileges. This can lead to full compromise of the device, including data theft, manipulation of router settings, and potential use in botnets.",
          "attack_vector": "An attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the router's web interface, including the `exeshell` parameter containing the desired command.",
          "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to reach the web interface of the router. This could be achieved by being on the same network as the device, or by having a valid IP address if the web interface is exposed to the internet."
