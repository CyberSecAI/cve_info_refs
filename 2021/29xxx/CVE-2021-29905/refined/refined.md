- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the web UI of IBM Jazz for Service Management.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web UI, potentially altering the intended functionality and leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable through the web UI, likely by injecting malicious JavaScript code through user-provided input fields or other parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable web UI to inject malicious script. This might involve social engineering to trick legitimate users into clicking on a crafted link or injecting the code directly into a user input field.
