  "CVE-2021-29255": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Unencrypted transmission of administrative credentials",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Cleartext transmission of admin credentials",
        "Unauthenticated access to firmware version information"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker on the same network can gain admin access to the device, allowing for persistent access through malicious firmware updates or other malicious activities. An attacker can obtain the firmware version of the camera, potentially allowing them to find known vulnerabilities for that specific version.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Man-in-the-middle attacks (e.g., ARP poisoning) to capture cleartext admin credentials.",
        "Direct access to the web interface to read the web.ini file and expose firmware information."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable IPCamera or able to intercept unencrypted network traffic between the camera and the internet."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Unauthenticated firmware version disclosure",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
          "Unauthenticated access to firmware version information"
      ],
        "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can learn the IPCameraâ€™s current firmware version which can be used to find known vulnerabilities or download the firmware version online and discover new vulnerabilities to exploit.",
        "Attack vectors": "Accessing the `/web.ini` file via web interface",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires network access to the camera's web interface"
    }
