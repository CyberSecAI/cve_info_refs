Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-29960:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Firefox cached the last filename used for printing a file.
- When generating a filename for printing, Firefox usually suggests the web page title.
- The caching and suggestion techniques combined may have led to the title of a website visited during private browsing mode being stored on disk.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure caching of potentially sensitive data (website titles) from private browsing sessions.
- Failure to properly isolate private browsing data from persistent storage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Disclosure of information about websites visited during private browsing mode. Specifically, the titles of those websites could be stored on disk through the print function.

**Attack Vectors:**
- User visits a website in private browsing mode and prints a page.
- The title of the printed page is cached by Firefox, potentially exposing sensitive browsing history.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not necessarily need to be in any special position, an attacker with access to the computer's filesystem can access the cached titles.
- The user needs to have visited the website in private browsing mode and used the print function.
- No network access or malicious website is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is described as having a "moderate" impact.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox version 89.
- The bug report associated with this vulnerability, Bug 1675965, is not publicly accessible.
