Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29950:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a logic flaw in Thunderbird's OpenPGP key handling. Specifically, when Thunderbird needs to use a secret OpenPGP key for operations like decryption, signing, or key import, it first "unprotects" the key, which means decrypting it and loading it into memory without password protection. If the operation fails after the key is unprotected, the key may remain in memory in its unprotected state because the code does not properly re-lock/protect it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Key Handling:** The primary weakness is the failure to ensure that secret keys are re-protected (encrypted) and locked in memory if a related operation fails after the key has been unprotected.
*   **Lack of Exception Handling:** The code lacks proper exception handling to re-lock/protect keys when errors occur during operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

If successfully exploited, this vulnerability could lead to the following:

*   **Exposure of Secret Keys:** An attacker, with sufficient access to the system's memory, could potentially extract unprotected secret OpenPGP keys.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** The extracted keys could be used to decrypt private communications, sign messages impersonating the key owner, or perform other actions that require access to the secret key.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Software:** An attacker could exploit the vulnerability with malicious software that triggers the vulnerable key operations in Thunderbird.
*   **Memory Access:** An attacker gaining access to the process memory of Thunderbird could potentially extract the unprotected key material if the operation fails and the key is not re-protected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to trigger the affected operations in Thunderbird (e.g., by sending a malformed email that would cause decryption/import to fail) or have access to the system memory where the Thunderbird process is running.
*   For the memory access attack vector, the attacker would need a privileged position or exploit an additional vulnerability to access the Thunderbird memory space.

**Additional Notes**

* The provided information is more detailed than the original CVE description which is just a placeholder.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during an audit of the RNP (presumably related to OpenPGP) source code.
*   The fix involved ensuring that keys are properly re-locked/protected in all failure scenarios.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Thunderbird 78.8.1.
*   A related regression (CVE-2021-29956) was found, indicating challenges in handling the key material protection correctly.
