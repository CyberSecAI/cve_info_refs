# Heap buffer overflow in `RaggedBinCount`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-4278-2v5v-65r4
May 12, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=2.3.0, < 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

If the `splits` argument of `RaggedBincount` does not specify a valid [`SparseTensor`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/sparse/SparseTensor), then an attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow:

```
import tensorflow as tf
tf.raw_ops.RaggedBincount(splits=[0], values=[1,1,1,1,1], size=5, weights=[1,2,3,4], binary_output=False)
```

This will cause a read from outside the bounds of the `splits` tensor buffer in the [implementation of the `RaggedBincount` op](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8b677d79167799f71c42fd3fa074476e0295413a/tensorflow/core/kernels/bincount_op.cc#L430-L433):

```
    for (int idx = 0; idx < num_values; ++idx) {
      while (idx >= splits(batch_idx)) {
        batch_idx++;
      }
      ...
    }
```

Before the `for` loop, `batch_idx` is set to 0. The user controls the `splits` array, making it contain only one element, 0. Thus, the code in the `while` loop would increment `batch_idx` and then try to read `splits(1)`, which is outside of bounds.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [eebb96c2830d48597d055d247c0e9aebaea94cd5](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/eebb96c2830d48597d055d247c0e9aebaea94cd5).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2 and TensorFlow 2.3.3, as these are also affected.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.
