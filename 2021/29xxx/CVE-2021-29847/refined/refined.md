- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A security issue with the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) configuration on POWER8 systems. Specifically, port 80 (web port) is not properly disabled despite being set to disabled in the BMC user interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The BMC configuration does not properly disable the web port (port 80), leaving it active even when it should be disabled. This creates a vulnerability, as the port can still be accessed.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The bulletin doesn't specify the impact of exploiting this vulnerability, but it can be assumed that leaving the web port open when it should be disabled could lead to unauthorized access or other security risks.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could potentially exploit the misconfiguration by accessing the web port (port 80) which is intended to be disabled. This could be done remotely over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need network access to the affected system and knowledge that the web port is active despite the settings.
