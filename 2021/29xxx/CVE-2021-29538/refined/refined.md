Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29538:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a missing check for a zero divisor in the `Conv2DBackpropFilter` operation within TensorFlow. Specifically, the `work_unit_size` can be calculated as zero based on user-provided tensor shapes and used as a divisor in a subsequent calculation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Division by zero vulnerability. The code calculates `shard_size` using `work_unit_size` as a divisor, without verifying that it is not zero.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing input tensors with shapes that result in a zero value for `work_unit_size` which will cause the division by zero and terminate the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves providing specifically crafted input tensors to the `tf.raw_ops.Conv2DBackpropFilter` function, as shown in the example provided.
- This requires the ability to control or influence the tensor shapes being passed to the `Conv2DBackpropFilter` operation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to provide input tensors to the TensorFlow model or application utilizing `Conv2DBackpropFilter`. This usually involves controlling the input data fed to the model, implying that they are in a position to influence the input pipeline.

**Additional Information:**
- The fix was introduced in commit `c570e2ecfc822941335ad48f6e10df4e21f11c96`, and backported to versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
- The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0.
- The vulnerability is rated as low severity, which is consistent with a simple denial of service.
