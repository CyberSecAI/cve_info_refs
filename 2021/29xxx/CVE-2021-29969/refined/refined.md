Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-29969:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Thunderbird handles IMAP server responses before the STARTTLS handshake is complete.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Thunderbird does not ignore injected IMAP server responses if they are received prior to the completion of the STARTTLS handshake.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious IMAP server responses.
- This can lead to Thunderbird displaying incorrect information.
- For instance, the attacker could trick Thunderbird into showing non-existent folders.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the IMAP connection.
- An attacker injects crafted IMAP server responses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify network traffic between Thunderbird and the IMAP server. This would typically require being on the same network as the victim or having control over a network device on the path.
- The attacker must be able to inject malicious server responses before the STARTTLS handshake is finished.
