Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29502:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the `warnsystem` module formats embed descriptions. Specifically, it uses Python's string formatting (`.format()`) on user-provided input (the warn description template), without proper sanitization. This allows for the injection of malicious code within the format string, leading to remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsanitized Input:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of user-provided input when formatting embed descriptions, enabling format string injection.
- **Remote Code Execution:** By injecting malicious code into the format string, an attacker can achieve remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can use the vulnerability to access sensitive information by setting up specific templates. The code is able to access and format attributes of discord objects (like members, roles), making potentially sensitive information available to the attacker.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The most severe impact is the potential for arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to take complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves manipulating the description template. Users can create a malicious format string using the `!warnset description` command. This string is then processed by the `format_description` function of the bot, leading to exploitation.
- Specifically, the vulnerability occurs in the `format_description` function within `api.py` where it uses `.format()` on the unsanitized template string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to set or modify the warning description template using the bot's commands (e.g., `!warnset description`). This likely requires the attacker to have administrative privileges on the bot or a specific server where the bot is used.
- The attacker also needs to be able to trigger the bot to use the malicious template.
