Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2021-29482.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `readUvarint` function in the `xz` library could enter an infinite loop when processing maliciously crafted input due to the lack of a limit on the number of bytes read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is a missing check to prevent the `readUvarint` function from reading an unbounded number of bytes. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful attack could lead to a denial of service, as the vulnerable function could get stuck in an infinite loop.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is providing a specially crafted byte sequence to the `readUvarint` function that will cause it to not terminate normally.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted input to the `readUvarint` function.

**Additional details:**
The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2020-16845, which affected the Go standard library. The fix involves adding a check to limit the number of bytes read by `readUvarint` to 10, returning an error if more bytes are read. The fix also includes a test case that ensures the error is correctly triggered.
