xz: fix a security issue for readUvarint

[Browse files](/ulikunitz/xz/tree/69c6093c7b2397b923acf82cb378f55ab2652b9b)

```
readUvarint could be provided a sequence of bytes where the application
would never stop. That is the same issue that has been recently
reported for the Go Standard Library as [CVE-2020-16845](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q6gq-997w-f55g "CVE-2020-16845").

The fix simply adds a check for the number of bytes read and reports an
overflow after more than 10 bytes are read, which is
$\ceil{\frac{64}{7}}$.

The commit also includes a test to ensure that the error is returned.

I thank Github user 0xdecaf for reporting the issue.
