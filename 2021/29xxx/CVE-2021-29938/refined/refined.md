- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `drain_filter` iterator in `slice-deque` increments the current index before calling the predicate function. If the predicate function panics, the last element can be dropped twice.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Double free vulnerability leading to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  High Availability impact. The double drop can lead to a crash due to memory corruption.
- **Attack vectors:** Network. The vulnerability can be triggered remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No privileges or user interaction is needed. The attacker needs to craft an input that causes the predicate function to panic.
