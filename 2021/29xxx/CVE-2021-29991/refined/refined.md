Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29991:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Firefox incorrectly interprets newlines within HTTP/3 headers. Instead of treating a header with a newline as a single, invalid header, it parses it as two separate headers. This is a deviation from the expected behavior, as HTTP headers are not supposed to contain unencoded newlines.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Header Splitting:** The primary vulnerability is header splitting. By injecting a newline character (`\n`) into an HTTP/3 header, an attacker can effectively create a second, attacker-controlled header. This is possible because Firefox fails to recognize the injected newline.
- **Incorrect Header Parsing:** Firefox's HTTP/3 header parsing logic is flawed, leading to the misinterpretation of newlines.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Response Splitting Attacks:** This vulnerability enables response splitting attacks. Attackers can inject malicious headers, potentially leading to:
    - **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** By injecting a `Content-Type` header that specifies a malicious file type or injecting Javascript code, they can execute scripts in the context of the vulnerable website.
    - **Cache poisoning:** Attackers could inject headers that force proxies to cache malicious responses, affecting other users of the same proxy.
    - **Other attacks:**  By injecting various headers, other attacks are possible, for example, session hijacking.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Traffic Manipulation:** An attacker would need to control the response from an HTTP/3 server. The attacker controls a server that sends back a malicious HTTP/3 response containing a newline in the header.
- **HTTP/3 Server:** The attack requires interaction with a server using HTTP/3 that supports sending a header containing a newline.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Server Control:** The attacker must have control over an HTTP/3 server to inject the malicious header.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to direct the victim to the malicious HTTP/3 server, typically by using a malicious link or by man-in-the-middle attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Firefox's handling of HTTP/3 headers. It does not affect HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 directly.
- The vulnerability was introduced with the enabling of HTTP/3 in Firefox 90.
- The fix involves sanitizing HTTP/3 headers, replacing problematic control characters like newlines with spaces, ensuring that headers are parsed as single entities.
