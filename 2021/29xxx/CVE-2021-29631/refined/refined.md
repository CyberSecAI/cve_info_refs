  "CVE-2021-29631": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2021-29631",
      "Affected Products": [
        "NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault)"
      ],
      "Status": "Final",
      "Last Updated": "01/06/2022"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "Missing error handling in bhyve(8) device models when fetching I/O descriptors.",
      "Weaknesses": "The vulnerability lies in certain VirtIO-based device models that do not handle errors when fetching I/O descriptors, leading to potential operation on uninitialized I/O vectors.",
      "Impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS). A malicious guest may be able to crash the bhyve process. It may be possible to exploit the memory corruption bugs to achieve arbitrary code execution in the bhyve process.",
       "Attack Vectors": "A malicious guest VM can trigger errors in the device model by sending crafted I/O descriptors.",
      "Required Capabilities": "An attacker requires a malicious guest virtual machine with the ability to use virtio-console, virtio-rnd, virtio-scsi, or virtio-9p device models."

    "Additional Information": {
      "FreeBSD Advisory": {
        "Affected Modules": "bhyve",
