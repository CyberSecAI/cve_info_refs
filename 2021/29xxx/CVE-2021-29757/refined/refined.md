{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper CSRF checking for some components",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The impact of this vulnerability depends on the actions that can be performed by the targeted component when processing requests with missing or invalid CSRF tokens.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could potentially craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, can perform unauthorized actions on the vulnerable application.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into triggering a malicious request. This can be achieved through various methods, like embedding the crafted request in a link or an image within a webpage controlled by the attacker or by injecting the malicious request through a social engineering method. The user must have an active session in the QRadar SIEM application add-on."
