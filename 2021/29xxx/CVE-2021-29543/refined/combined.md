# `CHECK`-fail in `CTCGreedyDecoder`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-fphq-gw9m-ghrv
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK`-fail in `tf.raw_ops.CTCGreedyDecoder`:

```
import tensorflow as tf

inputs = tf.constant([], shape=[18, 2, 0], dtype=tf.float32)
sequence_length = tf.constant([-100, 17], shape=[2], dtype=tf.int32)
merge_repeated = False

tf.raw_ops.CTCGreedyDecoder(inputs=inputs, sequence_length=sequence_length, merge_repeated=merge_repeated)
```

This is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1615440b17b364b875eb06f43d087381f1460a65/tensorflow/core/kernels/ctc_decoder_ops.cc#L37-L50) has a `CHECK_LT` inserted to validate some invariants. When this condition is false, the program aborts, instead of returning a valid error to the user. This abnormal termination can be weaponized in denial of service attacks.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [ea3b43e98c32c97b35d52b4c66f9107452ca8fb2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ea3b43e98c32c97b35d52b4c66f9107452ca8fb2).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang and Ying Wang of Baidu X-Team.

### Severity

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-29543

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
