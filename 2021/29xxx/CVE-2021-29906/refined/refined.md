- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the inclusion of the hash of an IBM Cloud API key within the Pod definition of an Integration Server. This occurs when the Integration Server is configured to communicate with cloud-based connectors in a cloud instance of IBM App Connect.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of sensitive information (hash of IBM Cloud API key) to a local user.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A local user could potentially gain access to the hashed IBM Cloud API key. This could lead to unauthorized access to cloud-based connectors and services if the hash can be reversed or used in some way.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the Integration Server's Pod definition.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A local user with the ability to access the Pod definition of the Integration Server.
