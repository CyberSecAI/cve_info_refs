- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The software uses weak cryptographic algorithms such as 3DES.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of weak cryptographic algorithms
- **Impact of exploitation**: This could potentially expose sensitive information if an attacker is able to intercept and decrypt communications.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by intercepting encrypted communications and using cryptanalysis techniques to decrypt the data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the IBM Spectrum Protect Plus server and clients and have the technical knowledge to perform cryptanalysis.
