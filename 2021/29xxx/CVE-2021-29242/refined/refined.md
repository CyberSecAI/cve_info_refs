{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper input validation in the CODESYS communication protocol.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability allows attackers to send crafted communication packets to manipulate the router's addressing scheme. This includes the ability to re-route, add, remove, or alter low-level communication packages.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow attackers to change the router's addressing scheme, potentially disrupting communication, redirecting traffic, or manipulating data within the CODESYS network. This could lead to a loss of control over devices, denial of service, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based. Attackers can send crafted communication packets remotely to exploit the vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have the ability to send network packets to the affected CODESYS devices. Low skills are required to exploit the vulnerability."
