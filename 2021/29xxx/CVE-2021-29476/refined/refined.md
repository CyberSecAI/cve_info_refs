Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-29476:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure deserialization of untrusted data within the `Requests_Utility_FilteredIterator` class of the `rmccue/requests` library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The `FilteredIterator` class was vulnerable to PHP object injection via `unserialize()`. This could be triggered by processing data from an untrusted source.
*   **CWE-502:** This vulnerability is classified under CWE-502, which refers to "Deserialization of Untrusted Data."

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could inject malicious PHP objects during the deserialization process. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:** Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to high impact in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system as arbitrary code execution is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is via the network, meaning a remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker doesn't need any existing privileges or user interaction to exploit this.
*  **Low Complexity:** The attack complexity is low.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was originally fixed in WordPress 5.5.2 and was later addressed in the `rmccue/requests` library in version 1.8.0.
*   The affected versions of `rmccue/requests` are 1.6.0, 1.6.1 and 1.7.0
*   The issue was resolved by disabling deserialization in `Requests_Utility_FilteredIterator`.
*   The GitHub Security Advisory for this vulnerability is GHSA-52qp-jpq7-6c54.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical).
