### @SergeyBiryukov **[SergeyBiryukov](/SergeyBiryukov)** commented [Nov 1, 2020](#issue-734008207) • edited Loading

WordPress 5.5.2 included a security fix to disable deserialization in `Requests_Utility_FilteredIterator`:

<https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/49373>

This PR aims to merge that change upstream.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Hi [@SergeyBiryukov](https://github.com/SergeyBiryukov) Thanks for the PR. Could a test be added to verify the behaviour of this fix ? And possibly to disclose the issue (privately) in more detail ? |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
