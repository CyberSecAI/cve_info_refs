{
  "CVE-2021-29134": {
    "description": "The avatar middleware in Gitea before 1.13.6 allows Directory Traversal via a crafted URL.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of the request path when serving avatars.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially access files outside of the intended directory on the server by crafting a specific URL. This could lead to exposure of sensitive information.",
    "attack_vectors": "Crafted HTTP request to the avatar middleware.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.",
     "details": "The vulnerability exists in the `storageHandler` function which did not properly sanitize the request URL. Instead of using `req.URL.EscapedPath()`, the code was using `req.URL.RequestURI()` which is more easily manipulable by an attacker. By inserting sequences like `../` in the request, an attacker could bypass directory access restrictions, gain access to files outside of the avatar directory."
