- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing secure header options in communication with the i2 Analyze server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Absence of certain security headers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The bulletin does not specify the direct impact of missing headers. However, missing security headers could expose the application to various attacks depending on which headers are missing. Examples include clickjacking, cross-site scripting, or other header-related attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through communication with the i2 Analyze server. The bulletin doesn't specify the exact type of communication or how the missing headers are exploited, but it is related to how the server sends HTTP responses.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to interact with the i2 Analyze server. The bulletin doesn't specify the network position required for the attack.
