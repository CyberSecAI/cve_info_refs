Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-29971:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stemmed from how site permissions were stored and checked in Firefox for Android. Instead of using the full origin (scheme + host + port) to identify a site, the browser was only using the hostname. This resulted in permissions granted to one site being incorrectly applied to other sites sharing the same hostname, even if they differed by scheme (HTTP vs HTTPS) or port number.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Origin Comparison:** The core weakness was the insufficient comparison of site origins. By only considering the hostname, the browser failed to differentiate between distinct origins as defined by the same-origin policy.
*   **Permissions Leakage:** This led to a situation where permissions granted to one site (e.g., `https://example.com`) were unintentionally shared with other sites on different schemes or ports (e.g., `http://example.com:8080`, `https://example.com:4343`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:**  An attacker could potentially exploit this by setting up a malicious site with the same hostname as a legitimate site, but on a different port or using HTTP. If the user had previously granted permissions to the legitimate site, the malicious site would inherit those permissions without requiring further user consent. This effectively escalates the privileges of the malicious site.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** With granted permissions, the malicious site could access user resources/features, such as location, camera, or microphone, that they would normally be blocked from accessing.
*   **MITM attack vector:** A local attacker could set up an insecure HTTP site to take advantage of permissions granted to the HTTPS version of the same domain.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector involves a malicious actor creating a website on the same host as a site a user previously granted permissions to. This could be done by setting up an HTTP site on a non-standard port.
*   The user would need to have previously granted permission to a legitimate site. The malicious site would then inherit that permission based on the hostname alone.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to host a website:** The attacker must have the ability to host a website.
*   **Same Hostname:** The attacker's website must have the same hostname as a legitimate website that the user has previously granted permissions to.
*   **Knowledge of permissions:** The attacker should be aware that the user has granted permissions on a certain site and needs to have the same hostname as that site to exploit this vulnerability
*   **Man-in-the-middle:** A local attacker could also use a man-in-the-middle attack on an insecure network to take advantage of this vulnerability, by setting up an HTTP site to impersonate the HTTPS version of the domain.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was specific to Firefox for Android.
*   The bug was fixed in Firefox version 90, which included a migration of the permissions database to store the full origin (scheme, host, and port).
*   The initial migration assumed all pre-existing permissions were for HTTPS with port 443, which is a safe assumption.
