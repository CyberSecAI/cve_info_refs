Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29975:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Firefox handles form validation messages. Specifically, it's a regression introduced by a previous fix for form validation popup placement (Bug 1684792). By manipulating the DOM, an attacker can trigger a form validation message, which, due to the regression, persists and can be displayed on top of other websites even after the original tab is closed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Spoofing/Overlay:** The core issue is the ability to display a custom validation message from one website over the content of another, entirely different website. This message can overlay buttons or other interactive elements.
*   **Persistent Messages:** The validation message does not disappear when the initiating tab is closed or navigated away from.
*   **Lack of Proper Context:**  The validation message appears without clear context or origin, leading users to believe it's part of the website it is overlaying.
*   **DOM Manipulation:** Attackers can use DOM manipulations, including setting `reportValidity()` in a `canvas.toBlob` callback and setting `contenteditable` to `true` to trigger the message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **User Confusion:**  Users can be misled by the overlayed message. They may believe it is an authentic message from the website that is displayed, leading to them taking actions they would not otherwise take.
*   **Clickjacking:** By carefully crafting the overlay message, an attacker can trick a user into clicking on overlaid elements, such as buttons, which can execute actions like retweeting or liking.
*   **Phishing/Spoofing:** The ability to control the text of the message allows for potential phishing or other spoofing scenarios, where users are tricked into providing information or taking action based on a false message.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker hosts a malicious webpage that contains the necessary JavaScript code to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **DOM Manipulation:** This involves manipulating the `reportValidity()` function via a `canvas.toBlob` callback and the `contenteditable` attribute to trigger the persistent validation message.
*   **Overlay:** The attacker positions the validation message over the target website and interactive elements, exploiting the persistence of the message across tabs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host Web Content:** The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage on the internet or have the user open a local HTML file.
*   **JavaScript Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be familiar with basic JavaScript and DOM manipulation techniques to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **No Special Privileges:**  No special privileges or access are required, as the vulnerability is triggered within the browser's standard rendering context.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is a regression caused by a fix for a related bug (Bug 1684792).
*   The severity was considered moderate, but a bounty was awarded because of its clever combination of elements.
*   The issue was addressed in Firefox 90, and a fix was also uplifted to Firefox 90 beta.
*   Firefox ESR 78 is not affected.

In short, this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject a persistent, custom message from a malicious site on top of a victim site, creating a potential spoofing/clickjacking attack vector by leveraging a regression in how form validation messages are handled.
