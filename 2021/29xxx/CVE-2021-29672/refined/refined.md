Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29672:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is caused by improper bounds checking in IBM Spectrum Protect Backup-Archive Client and IBM Spectrum Protect for Space Management. This lack of proper bounds checking leads to stack-based buffer overflows.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Stack-based buffer overflow: This occurs when a program writes data beyond the allocated buffer on the stack, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   The Gentoo security advisory states that the worst case impact is arbitrary code execution. This can allow an attacker to gain control of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The specific attack vector is not detailed, but the vulnerability exists in the IBM Spectrum Protect Backup-Archive Client and IBM Spectrum Protect for Space Management. The Gentoo advisory labels the vulnerability as "exploitable: remote," suggesting that the vulnerability can be triggered remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker would need to be able to send network traffic to the affected IBM Spectrum Protect client or agent. The specific details are not in the content, so it is unknown if authentication is required, or if it can be triggered anonymously.

**Additional details:**

*   Affected products and versions include IBM Spectrum Protect Backup-Archive Client and IBM Spectrum Protect for Space Management versions 8.1.0.0-8.1.11.0 and 7.1.0.0-7.1.8.10.
*   Fixes are available in later versions of the products.
*   No workarounds or mitigations are available.
