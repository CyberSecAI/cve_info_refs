The provided content relates to CVE-2021-29475.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way HedgeDoc (formerly CodiMD) processes file:/// references during PDF export using PhantomJS. While PhantomJS does not visually render these references in the PDF, it internally uses them, allowing for file exfiltration through JavaScript rendering.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Arbitrary File Read: The core vulnerability is the ability to read arbitrary files from the server's file system.
- Code Injection: The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a note.
- Insecure PDF Export: The PDF export functionality, using PhantomJS, processes file:/// references insecurely, leading to the exploit.
- Insufficient Input Sanitization: The application does not sufficiently sanitize input within notes, allowing for the inclusion of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file access: An attacker can read any file accessible to the server process.
- Sensitive data exposure: This includes configuration files like `config.json`, which may contain sensitive information like database credentials and OAuth secrets.
- System compromise: Exposure of sensitive data can lead to further exploitation and system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The attack is performed remotely over the network, as an attacker can modify notes through the web interface.
- PDF Export Functionality: The attack is triggered when an administrator or other authorized user exports the malicious note to PDF.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Note modification: The attacker must have the ability to modify a note within the HedgeDoc application to inject the malicious code.
- No specific user interaction beyond triggering the PDF export is required.
