Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29957:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from Thunderbird's insufficient detection of partially unencrypted emails containing a mix of MIME and inline OpenPGP content. Specifically, if a MIME encoded email contains an OpenPGP inline signed or encrypted message part, but also contains additional unprotected parts, Thunderbird failed to indicate that only parts of the message were protected. This could mislead users into believing the entire email was secured when it was not.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inadequate Security Status Indication:** Thunderbird did not properly notify users when an email contained both protected (OpenPGP encrypted/signed) and unprotected content.
- **MIME and Inline OpenPGP Handling:** The application's logic for handling mixed MIME and inline OpenPGP messages was flawed, leading to incomplete security checks.
- **Partial Processing:** Thunderbird was processing parts of the message at multiple levels and replacing the first rendered MIME part regardless of whether it was the PGP block, instead of removing unrelated DOM nodes and showing only the protected part.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Misleading Security Perception:** Users could falsely assume that their entire message was protected, potentially exposing sensitive information. This is because Thunderbird did not visually distinguish or flag the message as having both secure and insecure parts.
- **Information Disclosure:** By including unprotected content alongside protected content, attackers could trick users into revealing information they believed to be secure.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted Email Messages:** An attacker could create a specially crafted email that includes both inline PGP-protected content and unencrypted content, exploiting Thunderbird's incomplete handling of these mixed messages.
- **MIME structure manipulation:** The attacker can use multiple MIME parts, some with inline PGP and some without, to confuse the user about the security status of the message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs the ability to send emails to the victim.
-   The attacker needs to be able to craft emails with both protected and unprotected content in MIME format, specifically using OpenPGP inline.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix includes changes to how Thunderbird processes MIME structures and inline OpenPGP messages.
- The fix ensures that the application will now provide a partial PGP notification, won't automatically process the message without user interaction, and will hide other MIME parts when a partial PGP message is processed.
- The fix includes modifications to walk the DOM and remove unrelated DIV nodes, ensuring that only the decrypted/decoded parts are shown.
- The fix also addresses issues where no OpenPGP failure status was shown for messages that could not be processed.
- The fix was implemented and released in Thunderbird 78.10.2.
