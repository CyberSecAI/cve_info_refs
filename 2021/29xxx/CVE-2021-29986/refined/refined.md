Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29986:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A race condition within the DNS resolver thread when calling `getaddrinfo`. The vulnerability is a use-after-free. The `getaddrinfo` function is called with a hostname, which is stored in a ref-counted string. If the ref-counted string is modified or freed by another thread before or during the `getaddrinfo` call it leads to a crash in the `getaddrinfo` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** The core issue is that the hostname string used by the DNS resolver thread can be freed or modified while the `getaddrinfo` function is still using it, leading to a use-after-free condition.
- **Race Condition:** Multiple DNS resolver threads and the main thread concurrently access and potentially modify the same hostname string due to lack of proper synchronization.
- **Thread Safety:** The `nsTSubstring` is not thread-safe, which is used to store the hostname.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The use-after-free vulnerability results in memory corruption within the `getaddrinfo` call, leading to a crash. This could potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The crash of the DNS resolver thread will cause Firefox to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by browsing to web pages which trigger DNS resolution.
- An attacker could potentially craft a website or control domain names which will cause a large number of DNS requests to trigger the race condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require any special privileges to trigger the vulnerability, making it remotely exploitable.
- The attacker needs to be able to make the vulnerable application resolve a DNS name. This can be achieved by making the user visit a malicious website.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The crash occurs in the glibc code `sysdeps/posix/getaddrinfo.c`. Specifically, the crash occurs due to the `family = at2->family;` statement where `at2` is a dangling pointer.
- Disabling IPv6 (`network.dns.disableIPv6` to `true`) prevents the crash. This suggests that the issue may be related to IPv6 resolution in `getaddrinfo`.
- The fix involved making a copy of the hostname before calling `getaddrinfo`, ensuring the string is not modified from under the function's execution.
- The vulnerability is specific to Linux-based systems.

This vulnerability was resolved by making a copy of the hostname string before calling `getaddrinfo` which is tracked in bug [1696138](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1696138).
