```text
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA2` decryption process in `jose-browser-runtime` would execute both the HMAC tag verification and the CBC decryption, irrespective of whether the HMAC tag verification failed or not. This timing difference due to a padding error during CBC decryption provides a padding oracle.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Padding Oracle: Observable timing difference during CBC decryption when a padding error occurs, allowing an attacker to distinguish between valid and invalid padding.
    - Incorrect order of operations: HMAC tag verification should occur before CBC decryption, but this was not always the case, leading to the timing discrepancy.
- Impact of exploitation:
    - An attacker can decrypt data without knowing the decryption key.
    - By issuing an average of `128 * b` calls to the padding oracle (where b is the number of bytes in the ciphertext block), an adversary could decrypt ciphertext.
- Attack vectors:
    - Network-based attack (as indicated by CVSS vector "AV:N").
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction (as indicated by CVSS "PR:N" and "UI:N").
    - The attacker must be able to send crafted ciphertext to the vulnerable system and observe the timing differences in responses.
