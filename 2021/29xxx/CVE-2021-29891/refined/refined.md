Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29891:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a security issue within the BMC's (Baseboard Management Controller) HTTPS server related to the strength of the keys used in uploaded certificates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core issue is the acceptance of weak keys within uploaded certificates on the BMC's HTTPS server. Specifically, RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits and ECC keys smaller than 160 bits are considered weak and exploitable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploitation allows an attacker to potentially compromise the security of the BMC’s HTTPS server. Although not explicitly stated, this likely includes the possibility of man-in-the-middle attacks, unauthorized access, and tampering with the BMC's functions.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves uploading a certificate with a weak key (RSA key less than 1024 bits or ECC key less than 160 bits) to the affected BMC’s HTTPS server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs the ability to upload certificates to the BMC's web interface or have administrative access that allows them to do so.
