- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Processing specially crafted files leads to an uninitialized pointer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Uninitialized pointer, leading to potential arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Processing specially crafted files in image services or raster analytics.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted file to ArcGIS Server 10.8.1 (or earlier). The vulnerability requires a user to interact with the crafted file. The CVSS score indicates the attacker needs to have high privileges and user interaction is required, suggesting that the attacker needs to have a valid account on the server and convince the user to process the malicious file.
