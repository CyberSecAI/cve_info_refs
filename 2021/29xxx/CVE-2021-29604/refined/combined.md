# Division by zero in TFLite's implementation of hashtable lookup

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-8rm6-75mf-7r7r
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow-lite
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

The TFLite implementation of hashtable lookup is [vulnerable to a division by zero error](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1a8e885b864c818198a5b2c0cbbeca5a1e833bc8/tensorflow/lite/kernels/hashtable_lookup.cc#L114-L115):

```
const int num_rows = SizeOfDimension(value, 0);
const int row_bytes = value->bytes / num_rows;
```

An attacker can craft a model such that `values`'s first dimension would be 0.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [5117e0851348065ed59c991562c0ec80d9193db2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5117e0851348065ed59c991562c0ec80d9193db2).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-29604

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
