Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29604:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a missing check for a zero value before division in the TensorFlow Lite's implementation of hashtable lookup. Specifically, the code calculates `row_bytes` by dividing `value->bytes` by `num_rows`, where `num_rows` is derived from the size of the first dimension of the input tensor `value`. If `num_rows` is zero, a division-by-zero error occurs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Division by zero.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  The division-by-zero error could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the application that uses the vulnerable code.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious TensorFlow Lite model where the first dimension of the `values` input tensor is set to 0.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted TensorFlow Lite model that causes the division by zero error during hashtable lookup operation. This likely requires the ability to influence the input model provided to a vulnerable application.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit `5117e0851348065ed59c991562c0ec80d9193db2` by adding a check to ensure `num_rows` is not zero.
- The fix was included in TensorFlow 2.5.0 and also backported to 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
- The vulnerability was reported by the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
- The severity is rated as "Low".
