- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `through` and `through_and` functions in the `through` crate use `ptr::read` to duplicate ownership of a mutable reference before applying a mapping function. If the mapping function panics, both the original object and the duplicated object are dropped, leading to a double free.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Double free vulnerability due to incorrect handling of ownership when a mapping function panics.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service due to a double free.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by calling the `through` or `through_and` functions with a mapping function that panics. The attack vector is network as the CVSS score indicates.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No privileges or user interaction required, it only requires the ability to trigger a panic in the mapping function.
