Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29415:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a weakness in the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840 microcontroller, which is used in several open-source security tokens like Google OpenSK and Feitian OpenSK.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is the ability to circumvent the read-out protection mechanisms of the nRF52840 microcontroller via fault injection attacks. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended security measures.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows the attacker to extract sensitive information (private keys) from the security token's memory and compromise the device security.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves fault injection against the nRF52840 microcontroller. This likely requires physical access to the device, controlled laboratory setting and the use of specialized equipment.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker requires physical access to the security token and expertise in hardware security, specifically fault injection techniques, and needs access to tools like oscilloscopes operating in the sub-GHz range, pen-like EM measurement probes for side-channel analysis and other fault injection equipment.
