Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29441:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2021-29441. It discusses an authentication bypass vulnerability in Nacos, which is the subject of this CVE. The GitHub Advisory Database entry also explicitly mentions CVE-2021-29441.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a flawed authentication logic in `com.alibaba.nacos.core.auth.AuthFilter#doFilter`. Specifically:

   - **Initial Bypass:** The code initially had a hardcoded bypass for requests with the `User-Agent: Nacos-Server` header. This was meant to allow internal Nacos server communication, but could be easily spoofed by any client.
   - **Server Identity Key-Value Authentication Bypass:** Although a fix was implemented to allow administrators to specify a custom header for server identity checks, the logic was still flawed.  If the `serverIdentity` header does not match the configured value, instead of rejecting the request, the code continues execution.
   - **Path Manipulation Bypass:** The vulnerability can be triggered by adding a trailing slash `/` to the request path. This path is then used to look up the controller method to call. If no matching method is found, the code bypasses authentication checks because of the `method == null` condition, leading to the authentication bypass. This occurs because the `ControllerMethodsCache` does not contain mapping with trailing slashes.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass authentication checks entirely.
   - **Insecure Default Configuration:** The default setting for `nacos.core.auth.enable.userAgentAuthWhite` was `true`, allowing the `Nacos-Server` user-agent bypass by default.
   - **Flawed Logic:** The `AuthFilter` doesn't properly reject requests when the server identity key or value do not match and relies on a null method check as an authorization bypass.
   - **Path Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploitable via path manipulation by adding an extra slash `/` at the end of a URL

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication, perform any administrative tasks, including adding new users, modifying configurations, and potentially taking complete control of the Nacos server.
   - **Data Breach:** Unauthenticated access could lead to data breaches, as an attacker could potentially access and exfiltrate sensitive information managed by Nacos.
   - **Denial of Service:** An attacker could modify configurations, leading to denial of service by making services unavailable.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **HTTP Request Modification:** The attacker can modify the HTTP request by adding a trailing slash to the request URI and sending it to the Nacos server.
   - **Spoofing User-Agent:** The vulnerability was initially exploitable by simply spoofing the User-Agent header to `Nacos-Server`.
   - **Bypassing Server Identity Check:** When `nacos.core.auth.enable.userAgentAuthWhite` is set to `false` and server identity is enabled, the path manipulation method can bypass this authentication measure.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Nacos server.
   - **HTTP Request Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests, including how to modify headers and URLs.
   - **No prior authentication needed:** The vulnerability allows unauthenticated access.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in `com.alibaba.nacos.core.auth.AuthFilter#doFilter`
*   The `ControllerMethodsCache` is used to map request paths to controller methods.
*   The `getMethod()` function in `com.alibaba.nacos.core.code.ControllerMethodsCache` uses `new URI(request.getRequestURI()).getPath()` to get the path from the request.
*   The addition of a trailing slash `/` via the URL in the request, results in a mismatch for the path lookup, which is then used as a bypass for authentication, due to a `method == null` check.

**Additional Notes**

*   The issue was fixed in version 1.4.1.
*   The provided content includes both a description in English and Chinese.
*   The content provides more detail than the official CVE description, especially in describing the bypass mechanisms.
