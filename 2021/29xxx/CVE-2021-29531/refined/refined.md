Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29531:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of input tensors in the `tf.raw_ops.EncodePng` function within TensorFlow. Specifically, the code checks if the total number of pixels in the image would cause an overflow but does not validate if the input tensor is empty.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Input Validation:** The `EncodePng` function fails to properly handle empty input tensors.
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** When an empty tensor is passed, the `image.flat<T>().data()` method returns a `NULL` pointer.
- **`CHECK_NOTNULL` Failure:** The `png::WriteImageToBuffer` function attempts to dereference the provided pointer which results in `CHECK_NOTNULL` triggering a crash when this pointer is `NULL`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the program to crash and terminate by supplying a crafted empty image tensor to `tf.raw_ops.EncodePng`, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Input Manipulation:** The attacker needs to craft a specific input tensor (an empty tensor) and pass it to the vulnerable `tf.raw_ops.EncodePng` operation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide or control the input to the TensorFlow model and specifically invoke `tf.raw_ops.EncodePng` with the crafted empty tensor.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit `26eb323554ffccd173e8a79a8c05c15b685ae4d1` addresses the issue by adding a check (`OP_REQUIRES(context, image.NumElements() > 0,...`) to make sure that the image has at least one element to avoid passing an invalid empty buffer.
- This vulnerability is considered "Low" severity.
- The vulnerability is fixed in TensorFlow versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2 and later.
