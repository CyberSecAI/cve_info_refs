# Cross site request forgery vulnerability

Low

[anuko](/anuko)
published
GHSA-pgpx-rfvj-9g4f
Apr 12, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 1.19.27.5431

## Patched versions

1.19.27.5431

## Description

### Impact

Cross site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability existed in Time Tracker versions below 1.19.27.5431. The nature of CSRF is that a logged on user may be tricked by social engineering to click on an attacker-provided form that executes an unintended action such as changing user password.

### Patches

The vulnerability is fixed in Time Tracker version 1.19.27.5431.

### Workarounds

Upgrade is recommended. If upgrade is not practical, introduce ttMitigateCSRF() function in /WEB-INF/lib/common.php.lib using the latest available code and call it from ttAccessAllowed().

### References

More information and example workaround code is available at <https://www.anuko.com/time-tracker/news/cross-site-request-forgery-vulnerability.htm>

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in <https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/>
* Email us at support at anuko dot com

### Severity

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-29436
