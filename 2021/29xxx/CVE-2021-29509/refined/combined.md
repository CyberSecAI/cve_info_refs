# [puma](/gems/puma) *6.5.0*

Puma is a simple, fast, multi-threaded, and highly parallel HTTP 1.1 server
for Ruby/Rack applications. Puma is intended for use in both development and
production environments. It's great for highly parallel Ruby implementations such as
JRuby and TruffleRuby as well as as providing process worker support to support CRuby well.

Package        : puma
Version        : 3.12.0-2+deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-29509 CVE-2021-41136 CVE-2022-23634
                 CVE-2022-24790

Multiple security issues have been found in puma, a web server for
ruby/rack applications.

CVE-2021-29509

    Keepalive Connections Causing Denial Of Service in puma.

CVE-2021-41136

    puma with a proxy which forwards HTTP header values which contain
    the LF character could allow HTTP request smugggling. A client
    could smuggle a request through a proxy, causing the proxy to send
    a response back to another unknown client.

CVE-2022-23634

    puma may not always call `close` on the response body. Rails,
    prior to version `7.0.2.2`, depended on the response body being
    closed in order for its `CurrentAttributes` implementation to work
    correctly. The combination of these two behaviors (Puma not
    closing the body + Rails' Executor implementation) causes
    information leakage.

CVE-2022-24790

    using Puma behind a proxy that does not properly validate that the
    incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230 standard, Puma and the
    frontend proxy may disagree on where a request starts and ends.
    This would allow requests to be smuggled via the front-end proxy
    to Puma

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
3.12.0-2+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your puma packages.

For the detailed security status of puma please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/puma>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# Keepalive Connections Causing Denial Of Service in puma

High

[nateberkopec](/nateberkopec)
published
GHSA-q28m-8xjw-8vr5
May 11, 2021

## Package

bundler

puma
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

<= 4.3.7, 5.x <= 5.3.0

## Patched versions

4.3.8, 5.3.1

## Description

This vulnerability is related to [CVE-2019-16770](https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-7xx3-m584-x994).

### Impact

The fix for [CVE-2019-16770](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7xx3-m584-x994 "CVE-2019-16770") was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster.

A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections.

### Patches

This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1.

### Workarounds

Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. [slowloris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowloris_%28computer_security%29)).

The fix is very small. [A git patch is available here](https://gist.github.com/nateberkopec/4b3ea5676c0d70cbb37c82d54be25837) for those using [unsupported versions](https://github.com/puma/puma/security/policy#supported-versions) of Puma.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [Puma](https://github.com/puma/puma).
* To report problems with this fix or to report another vulnerability, see [our security policy.](https://github.com/puma/puma/security/policy)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
