- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Some API endpoints under `/.pomerium/` do not verify parameters with `pomerium_signature`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper verification of parameters using `pomerium_signature`. This falls under the CWE-601 category (URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers could modify parameters that are intended to be trusted by Pomerium. This mainly impacts routes responsible for sign in/out, but it is explicitly stated that there is no authentication bypass.
- **Attack vectors**: By manipulating the parameters in API requests to the vulnerable endpoints under `/.pomerium/`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to send requests to the vulnerable API endpoints and manipulate the parameters.

The provided content offers more detail than the original CVE description placeholder, specifying the affected endpoints (`/.pomerium/`) and impact (modification of trusted parameters during sign in/out) and clarifies there is no auth bypass.
