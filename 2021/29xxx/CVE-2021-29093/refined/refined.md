- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a Use-After-Free condition when processing specially crafted files in image services or raster analytics.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a Use-After-Free (CWE-416)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the ArcGIS Server.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by processing specially crafted files within image services or raster analytics.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs high privileges (PR:H) and a user interaction is required (UI:R). The attack vector is over the network (AV:N), and the system scope is unchanged (S:U). The exploit code maturity is unproven.
