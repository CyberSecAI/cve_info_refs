Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29556:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a division-by-zero error within the `tf.raw_ops.Reverse` operation in TensorFlow. Specifically, the implementation calculates a `cost_per_unit` by dividing the total number of elements by the size of the first dimension of the input tensor. If the first dimension is zero, this calculation results in a division by zero, leading to a floating point exception (FPE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Division by zero vulnerability.
- Lack of input validation for the first dimension size before division.
- The vulnerable code is in `tensorflow/core/kernels/reverse_op.cc`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS). An attacker can craft a specific input tensor with a zero-sized first dimension, triggering the division by zero, causing the TensorFlow program to crash due to an FPE.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must be able to supply the arguments to `tf.raw_ops.Reverse`. Specifically, they need to control the first dimension of the input tensor, allowing them to set it to zero.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute code that utilizes the TensorFlow library with the `tf.raw_ops.Reverse` function, and supply crafted input tensors.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability is in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0.
- Patched versions: 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the first dimension of the input tensor is not zero before performing the division. The specific code change is in `tensorflow/core/kernels/reverse_op.cc` by adding a check using OP_REQUIRES.
- The vulnerability was reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.
- Severity is marked as Low.
- The commit containing the fix is [4071d8e2f6c45c1955a811fee757ca2adbe462c1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4071d8e2f6c45c1955a811fee757ca2adbe462c1)
