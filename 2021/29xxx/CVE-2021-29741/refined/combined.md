To extract the fixes from the tar file:

tar xvf ksh\_fix.tar
cd ksh\_fix

Verify you have retrieved the fixes intact:

The checksums below were generated using the "openssl dgst -sha256 [filename]" command as the following:

| openssl dgst -sha256 | filename |

These sums should match exactly. The OpenSSL signatures in the tar file and on this advisory can also be used to verify the integrity of the fixes.  If the sums or signatures cannot be confirmed, contact IBM Support at <http://ibm.com/support/> and describe the discrepancy.

openssl dgst -sha256 -verify [pubkey\_file] -signature [advisory\_file].sig [advisory\_file]

openssl dgst -sha256 -verify [pubkey\_file] -signature [ifix\_file].sig [ifix\_file]

Published advisory OpenSSL signature file location:

**C. FIX AND INTERIM FIX INSTALLATION**

If possible, it is recommended that a mksysb backup of the system be created. Verify it is both bootable and readable before proceeding.

To preview a fix installation:

installp -a -d fix\_name -p all  # where fix\_name is the name of the
                                            # fix package being previewed.

To install a fix package:

installp -a -d fix\_name -X all  # where fix\_name is the name of the
                                            # fix package being installed.

Interim fixes have had limited functional and regression testing but not the full regression testing that takes place for Service Packs; however, IBM does fully support them.

Interim fix management documentation can be found at:

<http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/aix.efixmgmt/home.html>

To preview an interim fix installation:

emgr -e ipkg\_name -p         # where ipkg\_name is the name of the
                                         # interim fix package being previewed.

To install an interim fix package:

emgr -e ipkg\_name -X         # where ipkg\_name is the name of the
                                         # interim fix package being installed.
