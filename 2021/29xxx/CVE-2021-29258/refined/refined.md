Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29258:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is triggered when Envoy receives an HTTP2 METADATA frame containing an empty METADATA map. This leads to a crash due to a reachable assertion being triggered.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of empty METADATA map in HTTP2 METADATA frames.
- The presence of an assertion that can be triggered by specific input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) due to the crash of the Envoy process.

**Attack vectors:**
- A remote attacker sends a crafted HTTP2 request with a METADATA frame containing an empty METADATA map.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP2 requests to the vulnerable Envoy instance.
