{
  "CVE-2021-29445": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is a padding oracle attack in the jose-node-esm-runtime library, specifically affecting AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA2 decryption. The library would execute both HMAC tag verification and CBC decryption regardless of whether either failed, throwing a JWEDecryptionFailed exception in both cases. However, there was a timing difference when padding errors would occur during CBC decryption, creating a padding oracle. An attacker could exploit this to decrypt data without the decryption key by sending multiple requests (average of 128*b, where b is the number of bytes in a ciphertext block).",
    "Root cause": "The library performed both HMAC tag verification and CBC decryption before checking for failures, leading to a timing discrepancy during padding error conditions in CBC decryption.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Timing discrepancy during error conditions, creating a padding oracle.",
      "Improper handling of decryption failures."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could decrypt data without knowing the decryption key.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network. An attacker sends specially crafted ciphertexts to the vulnerable service.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to send network requests to the vulnerable service. No special privileges or user interaction is required."
