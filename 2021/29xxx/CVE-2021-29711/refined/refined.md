- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from inconsistent permission requirements between the CLI and UI for agent upgrades in IBM UrbanCode Deploy. The CLI method requires a lower set of permissions than the UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inconsistent permission requirements for agent upgrades.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with lower privileges via CLI can perform agent upgrades that would normally require higher privileges through the UI.
- **Attack vectors:** By using the CLI interface of the IBM UrbanCode Deploy, an attacker with the lower set of permissions required by it, could perform agent upgrades that would otherwise require higher permissions if performed through the UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have access to the CLI and have the permission set required for CLI upgrades.
