  "response": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient access control on the password reset functionality. An unauthenticated attacker can reset the Administrator account password via the `/redfish/v1/SessionService/ResetPassword/1` endpoint.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Authentication bypass",
      "Insecure default password handling",
       "Insufficient origin header validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to gain privileged access to the HPE Edgeline Infrastructure Manager, including:\n\t- Arbitrary command execution\n\t- Privilege escalation to root\n\t- Denial of service\n\t- Configuration changes.",
    "attack_vectors": "Remote, over the network. The attacker sends HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints of the HPE Edgeline Infrastructure Manager web application.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the HPE Edgeline Infrastructure Manager and does not require prior authentication. The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the server, including arbitrary headers to bypass the partial fix.",
    "additional_details": "The initial fix attempted to restrict the password reset to console users by checking the 'Origin' header. However, this mitigation was bypassed by simply setting the 'Origin' header to 'https://127.0.0.1'. The vulnerability was fully resolved in version 1.23."
