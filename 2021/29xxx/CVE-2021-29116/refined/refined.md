Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-29116:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Esri ArcGIS Server version 10.8.1 and 10.9 feature services.
- There is also a remote file inclusion vulnerability in the ArcGIS Server help documentation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to pass and store malicious strings via crafted queries. When accessed, these strings could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a user's browser. (CWE-79)
- **Remote File Inclusion:** The help documentation vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to inject attacker-supplied HTML into a page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Stored XSS:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution within a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Remote File Inclusion:** This could allow the attacker to modify the content of the help page.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Stored XSS:**  Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted queries to the vulnerable feature service endpoint which allows malicious code to be stored. The malicious script is then executed when a user views the feature service data.
- **Remote File Inclusion:** Attackers can inject HTML code into the server documentation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Stored XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted queries to a vulnerable ArcGIS Server feature service. This does not require authentication unless the service itself is secured.
- **Remote File Inclusion:** The attacker needs to be able to inject HTML into the help documentation.

The document also provides CVSS scores for the vulnerabilities:

- **Stored XSS:** CVSS v3.1 Base Score 6.1, Temporal Score 5.2
- **Remote File Inclusion (XSS):** CVSS v3.1 Base Score 4.7, Temporal Score 3.3

The document mentions mitigating measures such as securing hosted feature services or securing the web tier, but does not provide specific steps to do so.
