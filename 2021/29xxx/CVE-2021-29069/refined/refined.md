The provided content is related to a security vulnerability, specifically a post-authentication command injection vulnerability affecting certain NETGEAR routers. This advisory is associated with PSV-2020-0595, though it doesn't explicitly link to a CVE ID.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a post-authentication command injection flaw.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command injection vulnerability that can be exploited after successful authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The advisory specifies that the impact is high, with a CVSS v3 score of 7.3 and a vector indicating high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact (C:H/I:H/A:H). This implies a successful exploit could allow an attacker to gain full control of the affected router, potentially leading to data theft, manipulation, or disruption of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered post-authentication, suggesting a web interface or API attack vector.
- The CVSS vector includes AV:A, indicating an attack within the adjacent network is required.
- AC:H suggests the attack complexity is high.
- The attack requires a privileged user (PR:H) and user interaction (UI:R).
- Exploiting this vulnerability would result in a changed security scope (S:C)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the adjacent network, and must have valid administrative credentials to access the router's management interface. The attack is not automated, and requires user interaction.

**Affected products:**
- XR450 (firmware versions prior to 2.3.2.114)
- XR500 (firmware versions prior to 2.3.2.114)
- WNR2000v5 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.76)
