Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-29955:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a transient execution issue named Floating Point Value Injection (FPVI). This occurs during floating-point operations where a speculative execution path can lead to the generation of incorrect results. Specifically, it was possible to generate floating-point results with NaN-boxed values, which are not normally possible. This allowed the transient execution to proceed with these invalid values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Transient Execution Vulnerability:** FPVI leverages speculative execution, a CPU optimization technique, to leak data by exploiting incorrect computations performed during the transient execution window.
*   **Type Confusion:** The transient execution can cause type confusion, where a value meant to be a floating-point number is temporarily treated as a pointer. This can lead to memory access violations when the code then uses the "pointer".
*   **Memory Address Leakage:** Through the type confusion, attackers can cause the program to speculatively access memory at addresses controlled by the attacker, leading to the leakage of arbitrary memory addresses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Memory Address Leakage:** Attackers could read the values of arbitrary memory locations, potentially including sensitive information and/or enabling further attacks.
*   **JIT Type Confusion Attacks:**  The ability to control memory access can be used to create type confusion vulnerabilities in the JavaScript JIT compiler, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **JavaScript Code Execution:**  The attacker would need to inject malicious JavaScript code that triggers the vulnerable floating-point operations, which could be done by an attacker who has compromised a website or via other means of running code in a browser.
*   **Speculative Execution:** The vulnerability relies on the CPU's speculative execution mechanism, meaning it's not necessarily exploitable via typical code execution paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Execute JavaScript:** The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code in the vulnerable environment.
*   **Knowledge of Memory Layout:** Understanding the memory layout can allow the attacker to leak specific data using the leaked memory address.
*   **Ability to Time Operations:** (Though the exploit can be made without it) The attacker may need precise timers to amplify the leak signal using techniques like Flush+Reload, although it can be done patchless.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is related to Speculative Code Store Bypass (SCSB), but SCSB itself did not affect Firefox.
*   The initial mitigation involved masking the result of the floating-point operation (specifically, using a `CMP` and `CMOV` instruction) to ensure that invalid values generated during transient execution were cleared or replaced before being used further.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 87 and Firefox ESR 78.9, and was assigned CVE-2021-29955.
