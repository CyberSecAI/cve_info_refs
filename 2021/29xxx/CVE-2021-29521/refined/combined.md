# Segfault in `SparseCountSparseOutput`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-hr84-fqvp-48mm
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>2.3.0, < 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

Specifying a negative dense shape in `tf.raw_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput` results in a segmentation fault being thrown out from the standard library as `std::vector` invariants are broken.

```
import tensorflow as tf

indices = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0], dtype=tf.int64)
values = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0], dtype=tf.int64)
dense_shape = tf.constant([-100, -100, -100], shape=[3], dtype=tf.int64)
weights = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0], dtype=tf.int64)

tf.raw_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput(indices=indices, values=values, dense_shape=dense_shape, weights=weights, minlength=79, maxlength=96, binary_output=False)
```

This is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8f7b60ee8c0206a2c99802e3a4d1bb55d2bc0624/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L199-L213) assumes the first element of the dense shape is always positive and uses it to initialize a `BatchedMap<T>` (i.e., [`std::vector<absl::flat_hash_map<int64,T>>`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8f7b60ee8c0206a2c99802e3a4d1bb55d2bc0624/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L27)) data structure.

```
  bool is_1d = shape.NumElements() == 1;
  int num_batches = is_1d ? 1 : shape.flat<int64>()(0);
  ...
  auto per_batch_counts = BatchedMap<W>(num_batches);
```

If the `shape` tensor has more than one element, `num_batches` is the first value in `shape`.

Ensuring that the `dense_shape` argument is a valid tensor shape (that is, all elements are non-negative) solves this issue.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [c57c0b9f3a4f8684f3489dd9a9ec627ad8b599f5](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c57c0b9f3a4f8684f3489dd9a9ec627ad8b599f5).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2 and TensorFlow 2.3.3.

### For more information
