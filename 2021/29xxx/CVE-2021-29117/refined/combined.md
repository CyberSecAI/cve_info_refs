# ArcReader General Data Frame Security Update

By RandallWilliams and Michael Young

**Esri has released ArcReader 10.8.2, which resolves two low and one moderate-risk vulnerabilities in ArcReader.**

[ArcReader 10.8.2 is the last release.](https://support.esri.com/en/technical-article/000026734) We encourage users of ArcReader to transition to the updated alternatives for publishing and sharing map packages with ArcGIS Pro, and workflows using the ArcGIS Pro version of the ArcGIS Publisher extension in conjunction with ArcGIS Field Maps.

In the coming months, the ArcReader product website will be removed along with publicly available downloads. ArcReader software will continue to be available as a download from My Esri. The ArcReader online documentation will remain in place throughout the remainder of the ArcReader Product Support Life Cycle.

**Recommendation**

We encourage users of ArcReader to transition to the updated alternatives for publishing and sharing map packages with ArcGIS Pro, and workflows using the ArcGIS Pro version of the ArcGIS Publisher extension in conjunction with ArcGIS Field Maps.
