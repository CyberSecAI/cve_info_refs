- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-after-free (CWE-416)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability is a use-after-free, which occurs when a program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior and security issues.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to high impact, including  high confidentiality, integrity, and availability compromises.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring a user to interact with a malicious file, thus user interaction (UI) is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access and must convince a user to interact with a malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.
