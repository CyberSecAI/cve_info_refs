- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient login session timeouts in IBM i2 iBase.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate session expiration mechanism.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability could allow an attacker to maintain access to an i2 iBase session for an extended time, even after the user has ceased activity. This could lead to unauthorized access or data breaches.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with access to a user's session could potentially exploit the vulnerability. The document does not specify specific attack vectors.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to gain access to a valid user session to exploit the insufficient timeout.
