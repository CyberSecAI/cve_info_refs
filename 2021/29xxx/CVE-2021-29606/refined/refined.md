Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2021-29606.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds (OOB) read in the TensorFlow Lite implementation of the `Split_V` operation. Specifically, the `SizeOfDimension` function accesses tensor shape data using an index that is not validated against the bounds of the tensor's dimensions array.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Heap OOB Read:** The `SizeOfDimension` function reads from the `t->dims->data` array without proper bounds checking on the `dim` index.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `axis_value` used to index the dimensions array is not validated to be within the allowed range (0 to `NumDimensions(input)`).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **OOB Read on Heap:** A specially crafted TFLite model can cause a read beyond the allocated memory for the tensor shape array, potentially leading to unexpected behavior, crashes, or information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted TFLite Model:** A malicious actor can create a TFLite model that contains an invalid `axis_value` for the `Split_V` operation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious TFLite model to the vulnerable TensorFlow Lite implementation.
- No special privileges or network access beyond execution of this model on the vulnerable system is required.

The provided commit fixes this by adding validation that the `axis_value` is within bounds.
```
TF_LITE_ENSURE(context, axis_value >= 0);
TF_LITE_ENSURE(context, axis_value < NumDimensions(input));
```
