# Heap OOB read in TFLite

High

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-h4pc-gx2w-f2xv
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow-lite
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

A specially crafted TFLite model could trigger an OOB read on heap in the TFLite implementation of [`Split_V`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c59c37e7b2d563967da813fa50fe20b21f4da683/tensorflow/lite/kernels/split_v.cc#L99):

```
const int input_size = SizeOfDimension(input, axis_value);
```

If `axis_value` is not a value between 0 and `NumDimensions(input)`, then the [`SizeOfDimension` function](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/102b211d892f3abc14f845a72047809b39cc65ab/tensorflow/lite/kernels/kernel_util.h#L148-L150) will access data outside the bounds of the tensor shape array:

```
inline int SizeOfDimension(const TfLiteTensor* t, int dim) {
  return t->dims->data[dim];
}
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [ae2daeb45abfe2c6dda539cf8d0d6f653d3ef412](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ae2daeb45abfe2c6dda539cf8d0d6f653d3ef412).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-29606

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
