Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of validation of uploaded SVG and XML files within the Kirby CMS. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code, specifically `<script>` tags, into these files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS due to the lack of sanitization of user-uploaded SVG and XML files. This allows for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's session when they access the malicious file.
- **Unvalidated File Uploads:** The core issue is that the system does not properly validate or sanitize the contents of SVG and XML files, which can contain embedded scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with write access to the Kirby Panel could upload a malicious SVG or XML file. If another user, especially an admin, opens the link to this file while logged into Kirby, the embedded script executes with their permissions. This allows the attacker to potentially gain higher privileges.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation enables attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser session. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as triggering unauthorized API requests with the victim's session permissions.
- **Data Theft:** Attackers could use the XSS vulnerability to steal sensitive information from the user's session.
- **Site Defacement or Manipulation:** Depending on the site, attackers can inject arbitrary code to deface the website or modify its behavior for malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Panel Uploads:** An attacker with write access to the Kirby Panel can upload malicious SVG or XML files.
- **Frontend Forms:** If the site allows SVG or XML file uploads through frontend forms without proper validation, it can serve as another attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Panel Access:** Attackers need to have write access to the Kirby Panel to upload malicious files directly.
- **Social Engineering:** The attack requires user interaction. The attacker needs to trick another user into accessing the malicious file link. This link can be shared with other users or site visitors.
- **Frontend Form Access:** For attacks through frontend forms, the attacker would need to be able to access and submit through the forms if not properly sanitized.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability requires user interaction and cannot be fully automated.
- The provided content also includes a patch and a script to validate previously uploaded files.
- The provided CVSS score is 7.6, with a base vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N, highlighting the high severity due to its network attack vector and impact on confidentiality.
