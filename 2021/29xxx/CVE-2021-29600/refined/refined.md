Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29600:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a division-by-zero error in the TensorFlow Lite implementation of the `OneHot` operator. Specifically, the code calculates `prefix_dim_size` by multiplying dimensions of the `indices` tensor. If any dimension is zero, `prefix_dim_size` becomes zero, leading to a division by zero when calculating `suffix_dim_size`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Division by zero error.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The division by zero error would lead to a crash or denial of service, effectively halting the execution of the TensorFlow Lite model.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a TensorFlow Lite model where the input `indices` tensor has at least one dimension of zero.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to create or modify a TensorFlow Lite model, to craft a malicious input. The attacker does not necessarily need to be local and this vulnerability is exploitable in scenarios where TensorFlow Lite models are used.

**Additional notes:**
- The fix involves adding a check to avoid the division if `prefix_dim_size` is zero, returning a degenerate tensor (a tensor with zero elements) if the input `indices` tensor is degenerate.
- Patched versions: 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2. This issue was fixed in commit 3ebedd7e345453d68e279cfc3e4072648e5e12e5, and included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
- Severity was rated as low.
