If input indices is degenerate, the implementation would do a divide by zero. See <https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/745d57df6d5e9bc568666a2a48ed8dd629c27241/tensorflow/lite/kernels/one_hot.cc#L68-L72>

# Division by zero in TFLite's implementation of `OneHot`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-j8qh-3xrq-c825
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow-lite
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

The implementation of the `OneHot` TFLite operator is [vulnerable to a division by zero error](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f61c57bd425878be108ec787f4d96390579fb83e/tensorflow/lite/kernels/one_hot.cc#L68-L72):

```
int prefix_dim_size = 1;
for (int i = 0; i < op_context.axis; ++i) {
  prefix_dim_size *= op_context.indices->dims->data[i];
}
const int suffix_dim_size = NumElements(op_context.indices) / prefix_dim_size;
```

An attacker can craft a model such that at least one of the dimensions of `indices` would be 0. In turn, the `prefix_dim_size` value would become 0.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [3ebedd7e345453d68e279cfc3e4072648e5e12e5](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3ebedd7e345453d68e279cfc3e4072648e5e12e5).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-29600

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
