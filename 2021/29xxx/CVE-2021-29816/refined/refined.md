- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in IBM Jazz for Service Management.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly validate requests, allowing an attacker to execute malicious and unauthorized actions on behalf of a trusted user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially execute malicious and unauthorized actions by transmitting requests from a user that the website trusts.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to craft a malicious request that is triggered by an authenticated user, leveraging the user's session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a legitimate user of the Jazz for Service Management system to execute a crafted request while the user is authenticated.
