Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-29429:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from Gradle downloading remote files accessed via `TextResourceFactory` into the system's temporary directory.
*   These files were created with open permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** Gradle created temporary files in the system's temporary directory with permissions that allowed other local users to read them.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information contained in downloaded remote files could be accessed by other local users on the same system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Information Disclosure:** An attacker with local access to the system could potentially gain access to sensitive information contained in files downloaded by Gradle.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires an attacker to have local access to the system where Gradle is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a local user on the same system where Gradle is executing and downloading files via `TextResourceFactory`.
*   No special privileges are required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Gradle versions prior to 7.0.
*   Gradle 7.0 moves temporary file creation to the Gradle User Home directory which is restricted to the user running the build.
*   Workarounds include setting a more restrictive `umask` or moving the Java temporary directory by setting the `java.io.tmpdir` system property.

This detailed analysis is consistent with the official CVE description, providing further details on the affected component and mitigation strategies.
