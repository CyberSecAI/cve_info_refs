Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29653:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- A change in the `tidy_revoked_certs` logic in Vault 1.5.1 introduced an unintended effect where revoked-but-unexpired certificates were removed from the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) when the tidy operation was performed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect CRL Handling:** The `tidy_revoked_certs` function incorrectly removed revoked certificates that were still within their validity period from the CRL. This contradicts the expected behavior where a certificate should remain on the CRL until its expiration, even after revocation.
- **Data Loss:** The revoked certificates were permanently removed from Vault storage, making it impossible to regenerate a correct CRL even after the fix is applied.
- **Bypass of Revocation:** Because revoked-but-unexpired certificates were removed from the CRL, they would be treated as valid by clients relying on the CRL for certificate verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Invalid Certificates Accepted:** Clients relying on the CRL would incorrectly accept revoked certificates as valid, potentially leading to unauthorized access or other security breaches.
- **Loss of Revocation Enforcement:** The vulnerability allows revoked certificates to bypass the intended revocation mechanism, undermining the security of the PKI infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered by using the `tidy` mechanism with the `tidy_revoked_certs` parameter set to true within the Vault PKI secrets engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to Vault:** The attacker needs to be in a position to trigger the `tidy` API endpoint with the specific parameter set to true. This may require administrative access or the ability to influence Vault configurations.
- **Use of PKI Engine:** The affected environment must utilize Vault’s PKI secrets engine and have the `tidy` functionality enabled.

**Summary of Conditions for Exposure:**

1.  Using Vault version 1.5.1 or newer.
2.  Using the PKI engine's certificate revocation mechanism.
3.  Using and enforcing the PKI engine’s CRL.
4.  Using the PKI engine's `tidy` mechanism with `tidy_revoked_certs` parameter set to true.
