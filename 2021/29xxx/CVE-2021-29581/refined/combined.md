# Segfault in `CTCBeamSearchDecoder`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-vq2r-5xvm-3hc3
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

Due to lack of validation in `tf.raw_ops.CTCBeamSearchDecoder`, an attacker can trigger denial of service via segmentation faults:

```
import tensorflow as tf

inputs = tf.constant([], shape=[18, 8, 0], dtype=tf.float32)
sequence_length = tf.constant([11, -43, -92, 11, -89, -83, -35, -100],
shape=[8], dtype=tf.int32)
beam_width = 10
top_paths = 3
merge_repeated = True

tf.raw_ops.CTCBeamSearchDecoder(
  inputs=inputs, sequence_length=sequence_length, beam_width=beam_width,
  top_paths=top_paths, merge_repeated=merge_repeated)
```

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a74768f8e4efbda4def9f16ee7e13cf3922ac5f7/tensorflow/core/kernels/ctc_decoder_ops.cc#L68-L79) fails to detect cases when the input tensor is empty and proceeds to read data from a null buffer.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [b1b323042264740c398140da32e93fb9c2c9f33e](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/b1b323042264740c398140da32e93fb9c2c9f33e).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang and Ying Wang of Baidu X-Team.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-29581

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
