Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29987:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how permission panels are handled in Firefox and Thunderbird on Linux systems. Specifically, when multiple permission requests are made and the first panel is dismissed (e.g., by pressing Esc), subsequent panels can appear at a different position. However, the click registration remains tied to the original location of the panel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Clickjacking/Spoofing:** The core issue is that the visual location of the permission panel can be decoupled from the actual clickable area. This can be exploited by malicious websites to trick users into granting permissions they didn't intend to give.
- **Incorrect Widget Positioning:** The underlying problem is that the GTK widget positioning is not correctly updated when the panel is hidden and then shown again, especially within the X11 environment. The position change requests are ignored when the widget is not shown.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unintended Permissions:** An attacker can trick a user into granting permissions to the camera, microphone, geolocation or other sensitive features by exploiting the mismatch between the visual and clickable areas of the permission panel.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting a malicious web page that triggers multiple permission requests. The user interacts with the initial panel to dismiss it (e.g., pressing esc). Then subsequent panels appear in the incorrect position, tricking the user into clicking "Allow" when they intend to click elsewhere.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage that is opened by a user in Firefox or Thunderbird on a Linux system. The malicious website must be able to trigger multiple permission requests. The vulnerability is specific to the GTK toolkit behavior in X11 environments

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Firefox and Thunderbird specifically on Linux, and it was also reproducible on Gnome (X11) and KDE desktop environments.
- The issue is related to how GTK handles widget positioning when the widget is hidden and shown again.
- The fix involved saving the position requests when a window is hidden and then applying those requests when it is shown.
