Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29973:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stemmed from the fact that password autofill on HTTP websites was enabled without requiring user interaction on Firefox for Android. This was due to the `signon.autofillForms.http` preference being set to `true` by default on the Android version of Firefox, while it's `false` on the desktop version.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unintended automatic autofill of passwords on insecure (HTTP) websites.
- Lack of user interaction requirement for autofill on HTTP websites

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Potential compromise of user credentials by a malicious website via automatic password autofill. A user might not realize their password is being filled into an insecure form, potentially leading to credential theft.
- Increased risk of phishing attacks, as users may not be aware that they are on an HTTP page and that their password will be auto-filled.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Visiting a malicious HTTP website via Firefox for Android.
- A malicious actor could set up a fake login page over HTTP, and if the user had a saved password for that domain or a similar domain, the password would be automatically entered by the browser, without user consent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host a website using HTTP (not HTTPS) and trick the victim into visiting that page using Firefox on an Android device.
- The attacker needs no access to the victim's device, the vulnerability is triggered by the victim browsing to an HTTP site.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was specific to Firefox for Android.
- The fix involved disabling automatic autofill on HTTP pages, requiring user interaction (e.g., clicking the login field) before passwords are autofilled.
- The initial reasoning for enabling autofill on HTTP pages on mobile is not entirely clear, it might have been a workaround for a previous implementation.
- The fix also ensures that credit card autofill is also only available on secure pages.
