Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29980:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from uninitialized memory within a canvas object. Specifically, the `mGlyphs` member in `RecordedFillGlyphs` is not initialized in the constructor. If an error occurs during the construction of a `RecordedFillGlyphs` object, a destructor is called, which attempts to `delete[]` the uninitialized `mGlyphs` pointer, leading to a double-free.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uninitialized Memory:** The primary weakness is the lack of initialization of the `mGlyphs` member in the `RecordedFillGlyphs` constructor.
- **Double-Free:** The incorrect handling of the uninitialized memory leads to a double-free condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The double-free leads to memory corruption, which can cause a crash and potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution.
- **Exploitable Crash:** The memory corruption can cause a potentially exploitable crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating canvas objects in web content, specifically when an error occurs during creation of a `RecordedFillGlyphs` object and subsequent resource cleanup.
- Specifically, by crafting specific HTML content using canvas and triggering certain operations, a double free can be provoked.
- The vulnerability can be triggered through a combination of an iframe with specific javascript code, that triggers resource allocation/deallocation, and then causes a reload of the page, leading to the double free condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to serve or inject malicious HTML content that leverages canvas operations to trigger the vulnerability.
- They need to be able to cause an error during the creation of `RecordedFillGlyphs` to cause the double-free in the destructor.
- A user must either visit the malicious page, or be exposed to the crafted HTML content through other means.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue affects both Firefox and Thunderbird, because the underlying rendering code is shared between the products.
- The vulnerability has been classified as "high" severity, and is considered remotely exploitable.
- The vulnerability affects Linux, Windows, and potentially other operating systems.
- The bug was fixed by initializing the `mGlyphs` pointer in the `RecordedFillGlyphs` constructor.
- This vulnerability is also related to Bug 1715051.
