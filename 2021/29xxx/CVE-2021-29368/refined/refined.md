The provided content describes a session fixation vulnerability in CuppaCMS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not invalidate the existing session ID before authenticating a user. It continues to use the same session ID even after a user logs in.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Session Fixation: The application is vulnerable to session fixation because it doesn't generate a new session ID upon successful login.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Session Hijacking: An attacker can hijack a valid user's session by forcing the user to authenticate with a session ID controlled by the attacker.
- Unauthorized Access: The attacker can gain unauthorized access to the user's account and perform actions on their behalf.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker obtains a session ID by interacting with the application.
- The attacker coerces the victim user to use the attacker-controlled session ID, likely by getting the victim to log in to the application using the attacker-provided session ID.
- Once the user logs in with the provided session ID, the attacker can gain access to the victim's session by refreshing their browser using the provided session ID.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the CuppaCMS application to obtain a valid session ID.
- The attacker needs a way to make the victim use the session ID controlled by the attacker. This might involve tricking the victim into accessing a malicious link with the specific session ID.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the application after the victim has logged in using the attacker-controlled session ID.
