{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `swap_index` function in the `reorder` crate relies on the `len()` method of an iterator to determine the size of the vector to be created. If the `len()` method returns a value that is different from the actual number of elements yielded by the iterator, it can lead to out-of-bounds writes or the creation of vectors with uninitialized members.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write, use of uninitialized memory.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Memory corruption, potentially leading to unexpected program behavior, crashes, or information disclosure.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing an iterator with an incorrect `len()` implementation to the `swap_index` function.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control or influence the iterator passed to the `swap_index` function, specifically its `len()` method, and be able to execute the vulnerable code.",
  "Additional details": "The vulnerability arises because the `swap_index` function uses the value returned by `len()` for memory allocation, without proper checks against the actual number of yielded elements. This violates the expectation that `len()` is only a hint for optimization and should not cause memory safety issues if incorrect."
