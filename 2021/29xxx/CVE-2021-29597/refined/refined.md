{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a division by zero error in the TFLite operator `SpaceToBatchNd`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The code does not check if `block_shape[dim]` is zero before performing a division operation, leading to a division-by-zero vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can craft a malicious model where a dimension of the `block` input is 0, causing a division by zero, likely resulting in a crash or denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can craft a specially crafted TFLite model with a zero value in the `block_shape` input, which triggers the division-by-zero.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted TFLite model as input to the vulnerable `SpaceToBatchNd` operation."
