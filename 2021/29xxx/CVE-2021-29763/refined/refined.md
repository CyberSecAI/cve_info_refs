Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29763:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in IBM Db2 due to a flaw that, under specific conditions, allows a local user to repeatedly execute a procedure. This repeated execution leads to excessive memory consumption and can result in a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper resource management allows a local user to initiate a procedure that can consume excessive memory, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) - A successful exploit can render the system unavailable by exhausting available memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local Access: A local user with the ability to execute a specific type of procedure within IBM Db2 can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the system and the ability to execute specific procedures within the vulnerable IBM Db2 instance. No special privileges appear to be needed beyond regular user access to Db2.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all fix pack levels of IBM Db2 versions 11.1 and 11.5 across all platforms.
- IBM has released special builds containing interim fixes for affected versions, which can be downloaded from Fix Central.
- The NetApp advisory states that none of their products are affected.
- There are no workarounds or mitigations available.
- This vulnerability is rated as "MEDIUM" severity by NetApp and "unknown" by IBM.
