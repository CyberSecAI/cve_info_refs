Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29478:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow in the `COPY` command when handling large intsets (sets of integers).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability exists due to an integer overflow when the `COPY` command duplicates a large set key consisting of integer values. This occurs when the `set-max-intset-entries` configuration value is changed from its default.
- The integer overflow can lead to heap corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Heap corruption, potentially leading to remote code execution.
- In Redis versions 2.6 through 6.0 (though not exploitable via `COPY`), the integer overflow can result in corrupted RDB or DUMP payloads.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- The attack involves sending a specially crafted `COPY` command to a vulnerable Redis server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have network access to a Redis server.
- The attacker needs to be able to send commands to the Redis server and should have the ability to change the configuration parameter `set-max-intset-entries` or leverage a misconfigured Redis instance.
- Low privileges are required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in all versions of Redis starting with 2.6. However, versions prior to 6.2 cannot be directly exploited via the `COPY` command.
- The `COPY` command was introduced in Redis 6.2.
- A workaround includes preventing users from modifying the `set-max-intset-entries` configuration parameter using ACLs to restrict unprivileged users from using the `CONFIG SET` command.
- Redis versions 6.2.3 and later are patched against this vulnerability.
- Although Redis 6.0 and earlier are not directly affected by the `COPY` command vulnerability, they are advised to upgrade due to potential vulnerabilities related to lack of RDB and RESTORE payload sanitization.
