Debian Bug     : 987065

CVE-2021-29447

    Wordpress is an open source CMS. A user with the ability to
    upload files (like an Author) can exploit an XML parsing issue
    in the Media Library leading to XXE attacks. This requires
    WordPress installation to be using PHP 8. Access to internal
    files is possible in a successful XXE attack.

CVE-2021-29450

    Wordpress is an open source CMS. One of the blocks in the
    WordPress editor can be exploited in a way that exposes
    password-protected posts and pages. This requires at least
    contributor privileges.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.7.20+dfsg-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.
