The provided content is related to CVE-2021-29327.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `fx_ArrayBuffer` function within the Moddable SDK's `xsDataView.c` file. This occurs due to an integer overflow when calculating the size of the ArrayBuffer, leading to a large allocation size.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: A buffer is allocated with an insufficient size due to integer overflow during size calculation when creating an ArrayBuffer, then a large amount of data is written to the undersized buffer which causes a write out of bounds and corrupts the heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash: The heap-buffer-overflow leads to a crash of the application due to memory corruption and violation of memory access rules.
- Potential for further exploitation: While the provided information only details a crash, this type of vulnerability can potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution or denial-of-service if carefully crafted.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted JavaScript code: A specially crafted JavaScript program can trigger the integer overflow and subsequent heap-buffer-overflow by creating an `ArrayBuffer` with a calculated, large size.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute JavaScript code on the vulnerable system.
