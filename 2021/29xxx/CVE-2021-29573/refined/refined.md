Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29573:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a missing check in the `MaxPoolGradWithArgmax` implementation within TensorFlow. Specifically, the code doesn't validate that the batch dimension of the input tensor is non-zero before performing a division operation that uses this dimension.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Division by zero: The core issue is an attempt to divide by the batch dimension of a tensor, which can be zero, leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability causes a division-by-zero error, which can lead to a crash of the TensorFlow application using the `MaxPoolGradWithArgmax` operation.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting an input tensor with a zero batch dimension to the `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGradWithArgmax` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to influence the input tensors provided to `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGradWithArgmax`. This might be possible by controlling model inputs or by crafting specific TensorFlow operations.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0.
- Patches have been applied to versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2 to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.
- The fix was implemented in commit `376c352a37ce5a68b721406dc7e77ac4b6cf483d`.
