Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   A regression of a previous fix in the `bluemonday` library allowed the injection of `<script>` tags.
*   The vulnerability stems from how the library handles the uppercase Cyrillic letter 'I' (И). When lowercasing, Go maps this UTF-8 rune to an ASCII rune, which was not being properly handled in the sanitization process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS (CWE-79). The library failed to sanitize input correctly when encountering the uppercase Cyrillic "I" character.
*   **Sanitization Bypass:** Attackers could bypass the library's sanitization logic by using this specific Cyrillic character within `<script>` tags.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the vulnerable application.
*   **Data Theft and Manipulation:** This could lead to data theft, session hijacking, defacement of websites, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input:** An attacker crafts input containing `<script>` tags with the uppercase Cyrillic "I" character (И).
*   **Bypass Sanitzation:** The vulnerability lies in the library's failure to correctly sanitize the specific character leading to XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Input Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to provide input to an application that uses the vulnerable version of the `bluemonday` library.
*  **Understanding of Sanitization Weakness:** The attacker needs knowledge of the specific vulnerability in the library to exploit it successfully.
