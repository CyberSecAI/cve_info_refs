Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29555:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a division-by-zero error in the `tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNorm` operation within TensorFlow. The implementation calculates `rest_size` by dividing the total size of the input tensor `x` by the size of its last dimension (depth). When the last dimension is zero, this leads to a division by zero, resulting in a floating-point exception (FPE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Division by Zero:** The core vulnerability is the lack of input validation that could prevent division by zero when computing the `rest_size`.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not check if the last dimension (`depth`) of the input tensor is zero before performing the division operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger a floating-point exception, causing the program to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** The attacker crafts a TensorFlow graph where the `tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNorm` operation receives an input tensor `x` with its last dimension set to zero.
- **API Call:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNorm` API call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Control Input:** The attacker must be able to control the input tensor's shape, specifically setting the last dimension to zero.
- **Access to TensorFlow API:** The attacker needs to be able to call the vulnerable `tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNorm` operation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0.
- Patches have been made available for versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
- The provided commit `1a2a872` fixed the issue by adding a check to make sure that the depth isn't zero before the division operation.
- The vulnerability is classified as having "Low" severity.
