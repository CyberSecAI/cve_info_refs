Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29421:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure parsing of XML External Entity (XXE) in the XMP metadata of PDF files within the `pikepdf` library. The `lxml` library was used to parse XML without proper configuration to disable entity resolution, leading to the XXE vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **XXE vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is an XML External Entity injection. The XML parser was not configured to disable external entity resolution.
- **Insecure XML parsing:** The parsing library (`lxml`) was not initialized with the options needed to prevent XXE attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could exploit the XXE vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the server where the `pikepdf` library is being used.
- **Denial of service:** By using a specially crafted XML payload, an attacker could potentially cause a denial of service by trying to read extremely large files or files from infinite locations.
- **Other attacks:** If the system is configured in a particular manner, it may be possible to leverage the vulnerability to perform further attacks on the underlying infrastructure.

**Attack vectors:**

- The primary attack vector is by crafting a malicious PDF file containing a specially crafted XMP metadata section with an external entity definition.
- This malicious PDF would then be opened using the `pikepdf` library which would parse the metadata.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a PDF document to include a malicious XMP metadata payload.
- The attacker needs to induce a victim application to process this PDF document with `pikepdf` library.
- The attacker would not typically need local access to the host machine itself.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided content highlights that the fix involves using a custom XML parser that disables external entity resolution.
- The fix was backported to older versions of `pikepdf` (e.g., 1.19.4) showing that the vulnerability was present in prior versions.
- The vulnerability was reported by Eric Therond of Sonarsource.
-  The vulnerability was assigned Bugzilla ID #1945364 and #1946269 and CVE ID CVE-2021-29421.
