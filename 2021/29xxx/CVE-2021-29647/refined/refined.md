Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-29647:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an information leak within the Qualcomm IPC Router (qrtr) implementation in the Linux kernel. The `qrtr_recvmsg` function, responsible for receiving messages, fails to properly initialize a `sockaddr_qrtr` structure before copying kernel data to userspace. This structure has a 2-byte hole which is not being cleared, potentially exposing uninitialized data in kernel memory to user-space processes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The core vulnerability is an information leak. Due to the lack of initialization of the `sockaddr_qrtr` structure, uninitialized kernel memory is copied to user space, potentially revealing sensitive information.
- **Uninitialized Data:** The root cause is the lack of proper handling of an uninitialized data structure in `qrtr_recvmsg`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information from kernel memory. The exact nature and value of the leaked data would vary depending on system activity and memory layout.
- The protocol in question is not enabled by default in Debian's official kernel configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**

- This vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted message to the Qualcomm IPC Router which makes its way to the vulnerable `qrtr_recvmsg()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to be able to interact with the Qualcomm IPC Router (qrtr) and send crafted messages. This likely requires the attacker to have some level of access to the system and the ability to use the qrtr interface.
- Local access is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability, remote exploitation is not explicitly described, but could potentially be possible if the qrtr interface is exposed to the network.

**Additional notes:**
- The fix involves adding a `memset` to zero-out the `sockaddr_qrtr` structure before copying the data to the user.
- This vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions prior to the fix.
- The provided content also shows that this vulnerability was fixed in Fedora 32, 33 and 34 as well as Debian 9.
