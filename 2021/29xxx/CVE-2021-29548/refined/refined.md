Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29548:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing validation checks within the `QuantizedBatchNormWithGlobalNormalization` operation in TensorFlow. Specifically, the implementation did not enforce all constraints specified in the op's contract, which could lead to a division by zero error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing input validation in `QuantizedBatchNormWithGlobalNormalization` operation.
- Lack of checks for zero values in variance tensor, leading to division by zero.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) by triggering a runtime division by zero error, crashing the TensorFlow application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can craft specific inputs to the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedBatchNormWithGlobalNormalization` operation, exploiting the missing input validation. The provided example code demonstrates the specific input that triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute TensorFlow code and provide crafted input tensors to the vulnerable operation. This could be through a model that includes this operation, or direct manipulation of TensorFlow ops.
- No special privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability once the attacker is in a position to run the TensorFlow model/ops.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0.
- Patches have been applied to versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
- The fix involves adding the missing input validation checks.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity.
- The fix was introduced in commit [d6ed5bcfe1dcab9e85a4d39931bd18d99018e75b](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/d6ed5bcfe1dcab9e85a4d39931bd18d99018e75b).
- The advisory mentions that the implementation does not validate all constraints specified in the [op's contract](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/raw_ops/QuantizedBatchNormWithGlobalNormalization).
