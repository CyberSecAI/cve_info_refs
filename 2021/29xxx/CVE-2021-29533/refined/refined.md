Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29533:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `CHECK_*` assertions instead of `OP_REQUIRES` for validating user-controlled inputs in the `tf.raw_ops.DrawBoundingBoxes` implementation. Specifically, the code was not properly handling cases where the input image had a dimension of zero (empty image).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation: The code used `CHECK_*` assertions, which cause a program crash on failure, rather than `OP_REQUIRES`, which returns an error gracefully.
- Lack of handling for edge cases: The code did not handle the case of an empty image (a dimension with size 0) in the input, which caused a negative value for  `max_box_row_clamp` and subsequent `CHECK` failure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause a program crash by providing an empty image as input to `tf.raw_ops.DrawBoundingBoxes`, effectively denying service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Input manipulation: An attacker can craft an input with an empty image (e.g., `tf.fill([53, 0, 48, 1], 0.)`) to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `tf.raw_ops.DrawBoundingBoxes` operation.
- No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by replacing `CHECK_*` assertions with `OP_REQUIRES` to handle the error case gracefully.
- The patch is available in commit [b432a38fe0e1b4b904a6c222cbce794c39703e87](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/b432a38fe0e1b4b904a6c222cbce794c39703e87).
- This issue affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0, and patches have been backported to 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity.
