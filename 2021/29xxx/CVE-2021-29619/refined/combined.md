# Segfault in `tf.raw\_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-wvjw-p9f5-vq28
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

Passing invalid arguments (e.g., discovered via fuzzing) to `tf.raw_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput` results in segfault.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [82e6203221865de4008445b13c69b6826d2b28d9](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/82e6203221865de4008445b13c69b6826d2b28d9).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-29619

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
