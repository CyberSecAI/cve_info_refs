Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The Firefox for iOS download functionality, specifically the Swift HTTP client used for file downloads, did not properly check if the request originated from a private browsing context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Private Browsing Mode Cookie Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is the sharing of cookies from private browsing mode with the normal browsing context. This occurs because the download request is not isolated to the private browsing mode, causing it to potentially expose cookies set during private sessions.
- Lack of context awareness in download request: The download mechanism did not differentiate between normal and private browsing modes when initiating the download request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privacy Violation:** Private browsing data, specifically cookies meant to be isolated to private sessions, is exposed to the normal browsing context.
- **Tracking:** Cookies set in private mode can be used to track users across browsing modes, compromising the privacy benefits of private browsing.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Download Link Exploitation:** An attacker can trick a user into clicking a specially crafted download link within a private browsing session to set tracking cookies. These cookies then become accessible in a normal browsing session upon another download.
- **Website Interaction:** A malicious website visited in private browsing mode can set a cookie, and then a subsequent download request in normal browsing mode will reveal the private mode cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs a website accessible via both normal and private browsing modes in Firefox for iOS.
- The attacker needs to be able to control the website's content, specifically by placing the download links, to set and retrieve cookies.
- The attacker must have some level of control of a website the user might visit in either normal or private mode.
