Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29519:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a type confusion issue within the `tf.raw_ops.SparseCross` operation in TensorFlow. The implementation incorrectly handles the case where `internal_type` is set to `DT_STRING` while the input `values` tensor contains `DT_INT64` data. This leads to a `CHECK` failure within the `Tensor::CheckTypeAndIsAligned` function due to a mismatch in expected and actual data types during tensor processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Type confusion: The code logic doesn't properly validate and handle the combination of `DT_STRING` internal type with `DT_INT64` input values.
- Insufficient Input Validation: The `SparseCross` op does not enforce consistent data types between the internal type and the provided values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The type mismatch triggers a `CHECK` failure, causing the program to terminate abruptly, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- API manipulation: By carefully crafting input tensors with inconsistent data types, an attacker can force the `SparseCross` operation to enter a vulnerable state.
- Specifically the attacker would need to set the `internal_type` to `tf.string` while providing input tensors of type `tf.int64` for the `values` and/or `dense_inputs` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to call the `tf.raw_ops.SparseCross` function with specific arguments, which can be done either by having access to a model that executes this operation or by directly constructing and calling this operation through Python.
- Need to have control over the type and content of the input tensors.
