### **[xoffense](/xoffense)** commented [Mar 19, 2021](#issue-835951726)

| Hi team,  I would like to report XSS vulnerability.  **Description**  A cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in the SEO admin login panel version 4.8.0 allows remote attackers to inject JavaScript via the "redirect" parameter.   ---   **XSS Payload:** 2021-03-17"autofocus onfocus=alert(1) //"   ---   **Vulnerable parameter:** to\_time   ---   **Steps to Reproduce the Issue:**  1- Login to SEO admin panel 2- Paste below POC: `https://localhost/seopanel/webmaster-tools.php?fromPopUp=1&from_time=2021-03-02&rep=1&sec=viewWebsiteSearchReports&to_time=2021-03-17"autofocus onfocus=alert(1) //"&website_id=1`  As you can see, XSS is triggered and can send cookies to attacker.   ---   **Video POC:** <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EXu6uO7TOJLIaLbLpjuG-NbVW6GMI-vc/view?usp=sharing>   ---   **Impact** With the help of xss attacker can perform social engineering on users by redirecting them from real website to fake one. Attacker can steal their cookies leading to account takeover and download a malware on their system, and there are many more attacking scenarios a skilled attacker can perform with xss. |
