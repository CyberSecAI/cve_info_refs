# `ipaddress` â IPv4/IPv6 manipulation library[Â¶](#module-ipaddress "Link to this heading")

**Source code:** [Lib/ipaddress.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Lib/ipaddress.py)

---

[`ipaddress`](#module-ipaddress "ipaddress: IPv4/IPv6 manipulation library.") provides the capabilities to create, manipulate and
operate on IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and networks.

The functions and classes in this module make it straightforward to handle
various tasks related to IP addresses, including checking whether or not two
hosts are on the same subnet, iterating over all hosts in a particular
subnet, checking whether or not a string represents a valid IP address or
network definition, and so on.

This is the full module API referenceâfor an overview and introduction, see
[An introduction to the ipaddress module](../howto/ipaddress.html#ipaddress-howto).

Added in version 3.3.

## Convenience factory functions[Â¶](#convenience-factory-functions "Link to this heading")

The [`ipaddress`](#module-ipaddress "ipaddress: IPv4/IPv6 manipulation library.") module provides factory functions to conveniently create
IP addresses, networks and interfaces:

ipaddress.ip\_address(*address*)[Â¶](#ipaddress.ip_address "Link to this definition")

Return an [`IPv4Address`](#ipaddress.IPv4Address "ipaddress.IPv4Address") or [`IPv6Address`](#ipaddress.IPv6Address "ipaddress.IPv6Address") object depending on
the IP address passed as argument. Either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses may be
supplied; integers less than `2**32` will be considered to be IPv4 by default.
A [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised if *address* does not represent a valid IPv4
or IPv6 address.

```
>>> ipaddress.ip_address('192.168.0.1')
IPv4Address('192.168.0.1')
>>> ipaddress.ip_address('2001:db8::')
IPv6Address('2001:db8::')

```

ipaddress.ip\_network(*address*, *strict=True*)[Â¶](#ipaddress.ip_network "Link to this definition")

Return an [`IPv4Network`](#ipaddress.IPv4Network "ipaddress.IPv4Network") or [`IPv6Network`](#ipaddress.IPv6Network "ipaddress.IPv6Network") object depending on
the IP address passed as argument. *address* is a string or integer
representing the IP network. Either IPv4 or IPv6 networks may be supplied;
integers less than `2**32` will be considered to be IPv4 by default. *strict*
is passed to [`IPv4Network`](#ipaddress.IPv4Network "ipaddress.IPv4Network") or [`IPv6Network`](#ipaddress.IPv6Network "ipaddress.IPv6Network") constructor. A
[`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised if *address* does not represent a valid IPv4 or
IPv6 address, or if the network has host bits set.

```
>>> ipaddress.ip_network('192.168.0.0/28')
IPv4Network('192.168.0.0/28')

```

ipaddress.ip\_interface(*address*)[Â¶](#ipaddress.ip_interface "Link to this definition")

Return an [`IPv4Interface`](#ipaddress.IPv4Interface "ipaddress.IPv4Interface") or [`IPv6Interface`](#ipaddress.IPv6Interface "ipaddress.IPv6Interface") object depending
on the IP address passed as argument. *address* is a string or integer
representing the IP address. Either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses may be supplied;
integers less than `2**32` will be considered to be IPv4 by default. A
[`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised if *address* does not represent a valid IPv4 or
IPv6 address.

One downside of these convenience functions is that the need to handle both
IPv4 and IPv6 formats means that error messages provide minimal
information on the precise error, as the functions donât know whether the
IPv4 or IPv6 format was intended. More detailed error reporting can be
obtained by calling the appropriate version specific class constructors
directly.

## IP Addresses[Â¶](#ip-addresses "Link to this heading")

### Address objects[Â¶](#address-objects "Link to this heading")

The [`IPv4Address`](#ipaddress.IPv4Address "ipaddress.IPv4Address") and [`IPv6Address`](#ipaddress.IPv6Address "ipaddress.IPv6Address") objects share a lot of common
attributes. Some attributes that are only meaningful for IPv6 addresses are
also implemented by [`IPv4Address`](#ipaddress.IPv4Address "ipaddress.IPv4Address") objects, in order to make it easier to
write code that handles both IP versions correctly. Address objects are
[hashable](../glossary.html#term-hashable), so they can be used as keys in dictionaries.

*class* ipaddress.IPv4Address(*address*)[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv4Address "Link to this definition")

Construct an IPv4 address. An [`AddressValueError`](#ipaddress.AddressValueError "ipaddress.AddressValueError") is raised if
*address* is not a valid IPv4 address.

The following constitutes a valid IPv4 address:

1. A string in decimal-dot notation, consisting of four decimal integers in
   the inclusive range 0â255, separated by dots (e.g. `192.168.0.1`). Each
   integer represents an octet (byte) in the address. Leading zeroes are
   not tolerated to prevent confusion with octal notation.
2. An integer that fits into 32 bits.
3. An integer packed into a [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") object of length 4 (most
   significant octet first).

```
>>> ipaddress.IPv4Address('192.168.0.1')
IPv4Address('192.168.0.1')
>>> ipaddress.IPv4Address(3232235521)
IPv4Address('192.168.0.1')
>>> ipaddress.IPv4Address(b'\xC0\xA8\x00\x01')
IPv4Address('192.168.0.1')

```

Changed in version 3.8: Leading zeros are tolerated, even in ambiguous cases that look like
octal notation.

Changed in version 3.9.5: Leading zeros are no longer tolerated and are treated as an error.
IPv4 address strings are now parsed as strict as glibc
[`inet_pton()`](socket.html#socket.inet_pton "socket.inet_pton").

version[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv4Address.version "Link to this definition")

The appropriate version number: `4` for IPv4, `6` for IPv6.

max\_prefixlen[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv4Address.max_prefixlen "Link to this definition")

The total number of bits in the address representation for this
version: `32` for IPv4, `128` for IPv6.

The prefix defines the number of leading bits in an address that
are compared to determine whether or not an address is part of a
network.

compressed[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv4Address.compressed "Link to this definition")

exploded[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv4Address.exploded "Link to this definition")

The string representation in dotted decimal notation. Leading zeroes
are never included in the representation.

As IPv4 does not define a shorthand notation for addresses with octets
set to zero, these two attributes are always the same as `str(addr)`
for IPv4 addresses. Exposing these attributes makes it easier to
write display code that can handle both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

packed[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv4Address.packed "Link to this definition")

The binary representation of this address - a [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") object of
the appropriate length (most significant octet first). This is 4 bytes
for IPv4 and 16 bytes for IPv6.

reverse\_pointer[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv4Address.reverse_pointer "Link to this definition")

The name of the reverse DNS PTR record for the IP address, e.g.:

```
>>> ipaddress.ip_address("127.0.0.1").reverse_pointer
'1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa'
>>> ipaddress.ip_address("2001:db8::1").reverse_pointer
'1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa'

```

This is the name that could be used for performing a PTR lookup, not the
resolved hostname itself.

Added in version 3.5.

is\_multicast[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_multicast "Link to this definition")

`True` if the address is reserved for multicast use. See
[**RFC 3171**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3171.html) (for IPv4) or [**RFC 2373**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2373.html) (for IPv6).

is\_private[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_private "Link to this definition")

`True` if the address is defined as not globally reachable by
[iana-ipv4-special-registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xhtml) (for IPv4) or [iana-ipv6-special-registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv6-special-registry/iana-ipv6-special-registry.xhtml)
(for IPv6) with the following exceptions:

* `is_private` is `False` for the shared address space (`100.64.0.0/10`)
* For IPv4-mapped IPv6-addresses the `is_private` value is determined by the
  semantics of the underlying IPv4 addresses and the following condition holds
  (see [`IPv6Address.ipv4_mapped`](#ipaddress.IPv6Address.ipv4_mapped "ipaddress.IPv6Address.ipv4_mapped")):

  ```
  address.is_private == address.ipv4_mapped.is_private

  ```

`is_private` has value opposite to [`is_global`](#ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_global "ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_global"), except for the shared address space
(`100.64.0.0/10` range) where they are both `False`.

Changed in version 3.13: Fixed some false positives and false negatives.

* `192.0.0.0/24` is considered private with the exception of `192.0.0.9/32` and
  `192.0.0.10/32` (previously: only the `192.0.0.0/29` sub-range was considered private).
* `64:ff9b:1::/48` is considered private.
* `2002::/16` is considered private.
* There are exceptions within `2001::/23` (otherwise considered private): `2001:1::1/128`,
  `2001:1::2/128`, `2001:3::/32`, `2001:4:112::/48`, `2001:20::/28`, `2001:30::/28`.
  The exceptions are not considered private.

is\_global[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_global "Link to this definition")

`True` if the address is defined as globally reachable by
[iana-ipv4-special-registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xhtml) (for IPv4) or [iana-ipv6-special-registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv6-special-registry/iana-ipv6-special-registry.xhtml)
(for IPv6) with the following exception:

For IPv4-mapped IPv6-addresses the `is_private` value is determined by the
semantics of the underlying IPv4 addresses and the following condition holds
(see [`IPv6Address.ipv4_mapped`](#ipaddress.IPv6Address.ipv4_mapped "ipaddress.IPv6Address.ipv4_mapped")):

```
address.is_global == address.ipv4_mapped.is_global

```

`is_global` has value opposite to [`is_private`](#ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_private "ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_private"), except for the shared address space
(`100.64.0.0/10` range) where they are both `False`.

Added in version 3.4.

Changed in version 3.13: Fixed some false positives and false negatives, see [`is_private`](#ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_private "ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_private") for details.

is\_unspecified[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_unspecified "Link to this definition")

`True` if the address is unspecified. See [**RFC 5735**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5735.html) (for IPv4)
or [**RFC 2373**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2373.html) (for IPv6).

is\_reserved[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_reserved "Link to this definition")

`True` if the address is otherwise IETF reserved.

is\_loopback[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_loopback "Link to this definition")

`True` if this is a loopback address. See [**RFC 3330**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3330.html) (for IPv4)
or [**RFC 2373**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2373.html) (for IPv6).

is\_link\_local[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_link_local "Link to this definition")

`True` if the address is reserved for link-local usage. See
[**RFC 3927**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3927.html).

ipv6\_mapped[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv4Address.ipv6_mapped "Link to this definition")

[`IPv4Address`](#ipaddress.IPv4Address "ipaddress.IPv4Address") object representing the IPv4-mapped IPv6 address. See [**RFC 4291**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4291.html).

Added in version 3.13.

IPv4Address.\_\_format\_\_(*fmt*)[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv4Address.__format__ "Link to this definition")

Returns a string representation of the IP address, controlled by
an explicit format string.
*fmt* can be one of the following: `'s'`, the default option,
equivalent to [`str()`](stdtypes.html#str "str"), `'b'` for a zero-padded binary string,
`'X'` or `'x'` for an uppercase or lowercase hexadecimal
representation, or `'n'`, which is equivalent to `'b'` for IPv4
addresses and `'x'` for IPv6. For binary and hexadecimal
representations, the form specifier `'#'` and the grouping option
`'_'` are available. `__format__` is used by `format`, `str.format`
and f-strings.

```
>>> format(ipaddress.IPv4Address('192.168.0.1'))
'192.168.0.1'
>>> '{:#b}'.format(ipaddress.IPv4Address('192.168.0.1'))
'0b11000000101010000000000000000001'
>>> f'{ipaddress.IPv6Address("2001:db8::1000"):s}'
'2001:db8::1000'
>>> format(ipaddress.IPv6Address('2001:db8::1000'), '_X')
'2001_0DB8_0000_0000_0000_0000_0000_1000'
>>> '{:#_n}'.format(ipaddress.IPv6Address('2001:db8::1000'))
'0x2001_0db8_0000_0000_0000_0000_0000_1000'

```

Added in version 3.9.

*class* ipaddress.IPv6Address(*address*)[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv6Address "Link to this definition")

Construct an IPv6 address. An [`AddressValueError`](#ipaddress.AddressValueError "ipaddress.AddressValueError") is raised if
*address* is not a valid IPv6 address.

The following constitutes a valid IPv6 address:

1. A string consisting of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each
   group representing 16 bits. The groups are separated by colons.
   This describes an *exploded* (longhand) notation. The string can
   also be *compressed* (shorthand notation) by various means. See
   [**RFC 4291**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4291.html) for details. For example,
   `"0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0abc:0007:0def"` can be compressed to
   `"::abc:7:def"`.

   Optionally, the string may also have a scope zone ID, expressed
   with a suffix `%scope_id`. If present, the scope ID must be non-empty,
   and may not contain `%`.
   See [**RFC 4007**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4007.html) for details.
   For example, `fe80::1234%1` might identify address `fe80::1234` on the first link of the node.
2. An integer that fits into 128 bits.
3. An integer packed into a [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") object of length 16, big-endian.

```

Refer to the corresponding method documentation in
[`IPv4Address`](#ipaddress.IPv4Address "ipaddress.IPv4Address").

Added in version 3.9.

### Conversion to Strings and Integers[Â¶](#conversion-to-strings-and-integers "Link to this heading")

To interoperate with networking interfaces such as the socket module,
addresses must be converted to strings or integers. This is handled using
the [`str()`](stdtypes.html#str "str") and [`int()`](functions.html#int "int") builtin functions:

```
>>> str(ipaddress.IPv4Address('192.168.0.1'))
'192.168.0.1'
>>> int(ipaddress.IPv4Address('192.168.0.1'))
3232235521
>>> str(ipaddress.IPv6Address('::1'))
'::1'
>>> int(ipaddress.IPv6Address('::1'))
1

```

Note that IPv6 scoped addresses are converted to integers without scope zone ID.

### Operators[Â¶](#operators "Link to this heading")

Address objects support some operators. Unless stated otherwise, operators can
only be applied between compatible objects (i.e. IPv4 with IPv4, IPv6 with
IPv6).

#### Comparison operators[Â¶](#comparison-operators "Link to this heading")

Address objects can be compared with the usual set of comparison operators.
Same IPv6 addresses with different scope zone IDs are not equal.
Some examples:

```
>>> IPv4Address('127.0.0.2') > IPv4Address('127.0.0.1')
True
>>> IPv4Address('127.0.0.2') == IPv4Address('127.0.0.1')
False
>>> IPv4Address('127.0.0.2') != IPv4Address('127.0.0.1')
True
>>> IPv6Address('fe80::1234') == IPv6Address('fe80::1234%1')
False
>>> IPv6Address('fe80::1234%1') != IPv6Address('fe80::1234%2')
True

```

#### Arithmetic operators[Â¶](#arithmetic-operators "Link to this heading")

Integers can be added to or subtracted from address objects. Some examples:

```
>>> IPv4Address('127.0.0.2') + 3
IPv4Address('127.0.0.5')
>>> IPv4Address('127.0.0.2') - 3
IPv4Address('126.255.255.255')
>>> IPv4Address('255.255.255.255') + 1
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ipaddress.AddressValueError: 4294967296 (>= 2**32) is not permitted as an IPv4 address

```

## IP Network definitions[Â¶](#ip-network-definitions "Link to this heading")

The [`IPv4Network`](#ipaddress.IPv4Network "ipaddress.IPv4Network") and [`IPv6Network`](#ipaddress.IPv6Network "ipaddress.IPv6Network") objects provide a mechanism
for defining and inspecting IP network definitions. A network definition
consists of a *mask* and a *network address*, and as such defines a range of
IP addresses that equal the network address when masked (binary AND) with the
mask. For example, a network definition with the mask `255.255.255.0` and
the network address `192.168.1.0` consists of IP addresses in the inclusive
range `192.168.1.0` to `192.168.1.255`.

### Prefix, net mask and host mask[Â¶](#prefix-net-mask-and-host-mask "Link to this heading")

There are several equivalent ways to specify IP network masks. A *prefix*
`/<nbits>` is a notation that denotes how many high-order bits are set in
the network mask. A *net mask* is an IP address with some number of
high-order bits set. Thus the prefix `/24` is equivalent to the net mask
`255.255.255.0` in IPv4, or `ffff:ff00::` in IPv6. In addition, a
*host mask* is the logical inverse of a *net mask*, and is sometimes used
(for example in Cisco access control lists) to denote a network mask. The
host mask equivalent to `/24` in IPv4 is `0.0.0.255`.

### Network objects[Â¶](#network-objects "Link to this heading")

All attributes implemented by address objects are implemented by network
objects as well. In addition, network objects implement additional attributes.
All of these are common between [`IPv4Network`](#ipaddress.IPv4Network "ipaddress.IPv4Network") and [`IPv6Network`](#ipaddress.IPv6Network "ipaddress.IPv6Network"),
so to avoid duplication they are only documented for [`IPv4Network`](#ipaddress.IPv4Network "ipaddress.IPv4Network").
Network objects are [hashable](../glossary.html#term-hashable), so they can be used as keys in
dictionaries.

*class* ipaddress.IPv4Network(*address*, *strict=True*)[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv4Network "Link to this definition")

Construct an IPv4 network definition. *address* can be one of the following:

1. A string consisting of an IP address and an optional mask, separated by
   a slash (`/`). The IP address is the network address, and the mask
   can be either a single number, which means itâs a *prefix*, or a string
   representation of an IPv4 address. If itâs the latter, the mask is
   interpreted as a *net mask* if it starts with a non-zero field, or as a
   *host mask* if it starts with a zero field, with the single exception of
   an all-zero mask which is treated as a *net mask*. If no mask is provided,
   itâs considered to be `/32`.

   For example, the following *address* specifications are equivalent:
   `192.168.1.0/24`, `192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0` and
   `192.168.1.0/0.0.0.255`.
2. An integer that fits into 32 bits. This is equivalent to a
   single-address network, with the network address being *address* and
   the mask being `/32`.
3. An integer packed into a [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") object of length 4, big-endian.
   The interpretation is similar to an integer *address*.
4. A two-tuple of an address description and a netmask, where the address
   description is either a string, a 32-bits integer, a 4-bytes packed
   integer, or an existing IPv4Address object; and the netmask is either
   an integer representing the prefix length (e.g. `24`) or a string
   representing the prefix mask (e.g. `255.255.255.0`).

An [`AddressValueError`](#ipaddress.AddressValueError "ipaddress.AddressValueError") is raised if *address* is not a valid IPv4
address. A [`NetmaskValueError`](#ipaddress.NetmaskValueError "ipaddress.NetmaskValueError") is raised if the mask is not valid for
an IPv4 address.

If *strict* is `True` and host bits are set in the supplied address,
then [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised. Otherwise, the host bits are masked out
to determine the appropriate network address.

Unless stated otherwise, all network methods accepting other network/address
objects will raise [`TypeError`](exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") if the argumentâs IP version is
incompatible to `self`.

Changed in version 3.5: Added the two-tuple form for the *address* constructor parameter.

hosts are all the IP addresses that belong to the network, except the
network address itself and the network broadcast address. For networks
with a mask length of 31, the network address and network broadcast
address are also included in the result. Networks with a mask of 32
will return a list containing the single host address.

```
>>> list(ip_network('192.0.2.0/29').hosts())
[IPv4Address('192.0.2.1'), IPv4Address('192.0.2.2'),

[IPv4Network('192.0.2.8/29'), IPv4Network('192.0.2.4/30'),
 IPv4Network('192.0.2.2/31'), IPv4Network('192.0.2.0/32')]

```

subnets(*prefixlen\_diff=1*, *new\_prefix=None*)[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv4Network.subnets "Link to this definition")

The subnets that join to make the current network definition, depending
on the argument values. *prefixlen\_diff* is the amount our prefix
length should be increased by. *new\_prefix* is the desired new
prefix of the subnets; it must be larger than our prefix. One and
only one of *prefixlen\_diff* and *new\_prefix* must be set. Returns an

Deprecated since version 3.7: It uses the same ordering and comparison algorithm as â<â, â==â, and â>â

*class* ipaddress.IPv6Network(*address*, *strict=True*)[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv6Network "Link to this definition")

Construct an IPv6 network definition. *address* can be one of the following:

1. A string consisting of an IP address and an optional prefix length,
   separated by a slash (`/`). The IP address is the network address,
   and the prefix length must be a single number, the *prefix*. If no
   prefix length is provided, itâs considered to be `/128`.

   Note that currently expanded netmasks are not supported. That means
   `2001:db00::0/24` is a valid argument while `2001:db00::0/ffff:ff00::`
   is not.
2. An integer that fits into 128 bits. This is equivalent to a
   single-address network, with the network address being *address* and
   the mask being `/128`.
3. An integer packed into a [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") object of length 16, big-endian.
   The interpretation is similar to an integer *address*.
4. A two-tuple of an address description and a netmask, where the address
   description is either a string, a 128-bits integer, a 16-bytes packed
   integer, or an existing IPv6Address object; and the netmask is an
   integer representing the prefix length.

An [`AddressValueError`](#ipaddress.AddressValueError "ipaddress.AddressValueError") is raised if *address* is not a valid IPv6
address. A [`NetmaskValueError`](#ipaddress.NetmaskValueError "ipaddress.NetmaskValueError") is raised if the mask is not valid for
an IPv6 address.

If *strict* is `True` and host bits are set in the supplied address,
then [`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised. Otherwise, the host bits are masked out
to determine the appropriate network address.

Changed in version 3.5: Added the two-tuple form for the *address* constructor parameter.

### Operators[Â¶](#id1 "Link to this heading")

Network objects support some operators. Unless stated otherwise, operators can
only be applied between compatible objects (i.e. IPv4 with IPv4, IPv6 with
IPv6).

#### Logical operators[Â¶](#logical-operators "Link to this heading")

Network objects can be compared with the usual set of logical operators.
Network objects are ordered first by network address, then by net mask.

#### Iteration[Â¶](#iteration "Link to this heading")

Network objects can be iterated to list all the addresses belonging to the
network. For iteration, *all* hosts are returned, including unusable hosts
(for usable hosts, use the [`hosts()`](#ipaddress.IPv4Network.hosts "ipaddress.IPv4Network.hosts") method). An
example:

```
>>> for addr in IPv4Network('192.0.2.0/28'):
...     addr
...
IPv4Address('192.0.2.0')
IPv4Address('192.0.2.1')

False

```

## Interface objects[Â¶](#interface-objects "Link to this heading")

Interface objects are [hashable](../glossary.html#term-hashable), so they can be used as keys in
dictionaries.

*class* ipaddress.IPv4Interface(*address*)[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv4Interface "Link to this definition")

Construct an IPv4 interface. The meaning of *address* is as in the
constructor of [`IPv4Network`](#ipaddress.IPv4Network "ipaddress.IPv4Network"), except that arbitrary host addresses
are always accepted.

[`IPv4Interface`](#ipaddress.IPv4Interface "ipaddress.IPv4Interface") is a subclass of [`IPv4Address`](#ipaddress.IPv4Address "ipaddress.IPv4Address"), so it inherits
all the attributes from that class. In addition, the following attributes
are available:

ip[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv4Interface.ip "Link to this definition")

The address ([`IPv4Address`](#ipaddress.IPv4Address "ipaddress.IPv4Address")) without network information.

```
>>> interface = IPv4Interface('192.0.2.5/24')
>>> interface.ip
IPv4Address('192.0.2.5')

```

network[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv4Interface.network "Link to this definition")

The network ([`IPv4Network`](#ipaddress.IPv4Network "ipaddress.IPv4Network")) this interface belongs to.

```
>>> interface = IPv4Interface('192.0.2.5/24')
>>> interface.network
IPv4Network('192.0.2.0/24')

```

with\_prefixlen[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv4Interface.with_prefixlen "Link to this definition")

A string representation of the interface with the mask in prefix notation.

```
>>> interface = IPv4Interface('192.0.2.5/24')
>>> interface.with_prefixlen
'192.0.2.5/24'

```

with\_netmask[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv4Interface.with_netmask "Link to this definition")

A string representation of the interface with the network as a net mask.

```
>>> interface = IPv4Interface('192.0.2.5/24')
>>> interface.with_netmask
'192.0.2.5/255.255.255.0'

```

with\_hostmask[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv4Interface.with_hostmask "Link to this definition")

A string representation of the interface with the network as a host mask.

```
>>> interface = IPv4Interface('192.0.2.5/24')
>>> interface.with_hostmask
'192.0.2.5/0.0.0.255'

```

*class* ipaddress.IPv6Interface(*address*)[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv6Interface "Link to this definition")

Construct an IPv6 interface. The meaning of *address* is as in the
constructor of [`IPv6Network`](#ipaddress.IPv6Network "ipaddress.IPv6Network"), except that arbitrary host addresses
are always accepted.

[`IPv6Interface`](#ipaddress.IPv6Interface "ipaddress.IPv6Interface") is a subclass of [`IPv6Address`](#ipaddress.IPv6Address "ipaddress.IPv6Address"), so it inherits
all the attributes from that class. In addition, the following attributes
are available:

ip[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv6Interface.ip "Link to this definition")

network[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv6Interface.network "Link to this definition")

with\_prefixlen[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv6Interface.with_prefixlen "Link to this definition")

with\_netmask[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv6Interface.with_netmask "Link to this definition")

with\_hostmask[Â¶](#ipaddress.IPv6Interface.with_hostmask "Link to this definition")

Refer to the corresponding attribute documentation in
[`IPv4Interface`](#ipaddress.IPv4Interface "ipaddress.IPv4Interface").

### Operators[Â¶](#id2 "Link to this heading")

Interface objects support some operators. Unless stated otherwise, operators
can only be applied between compatible objects (i.e. IPv4 with IPv4, IPv6 with
IPv6).

#### Logical operators[Â¶](#id3 "Link to this heading")

Interface objects can be compared with the usual set of logical operators.

For equality comparison (`==` and `!=`), both the IP address and network
must be the same for the objects to be equal. An interface will not compare
equal to any address or network object.

For ordering (`<`, `>`, etc) the rules are different. Interface and
address objects with the same IP version can be compared, and the address
objects will always sort before the interface objects. Two interface objects
are first compared by their networks and, if those are the same, then by their
IP addresses.

## Other Module Level Functions[Â¶](#other-module-level-functions "Link to this heading")

The module also provides the following module level functions:

ipaddress.v4\_int\_to\_packed(*address*)[Â¶](#ipaddress.v4_int_to_packed "Link to this definition")

Represent an address as 4 packed bytes in network (big-endian) order.
*address* is an integer representation of an IPv4 IP address. A
[`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised if the integer is negative or too large to be an
IPv4 IP address.

```
>>> ipaddress.ip_address(3221225985)
IPv4Address('192.0.2.1')
>>> ipaddress.v4_int_to_packed(3221225985)
b'\xc0\x00\x02\x01'

```

ipaddress.v6\_int\_to\_packed(*address*)[Â¶](#ipaddress.v6_int_to_packed "Link to this definition")

Represent an address as 16 packed bytes in network (big-endian) order.
*address* is an integer representation of an IPv6 IP address. A
[`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised if the integer is negative or too large to be an
IPv6 IP address.

ipaddress.summarize\_address\_range(*first*, *last*)[Â¶](#ipaddress.summarize_address_range "Link to this definition")

Return an iterator of the summarized network range given the first and last
IP addresses. *first* is the first [`IPv4Address`](#ipaddress.IPv4Address "ipaddress.IPv4Address") or
[`IPv6Address`](#ipaddress.IPv6Address "ipaddress.IPv6Address") in the range and *last* is the last [`IPv4Address`](#ipaddress.IPv4Address "ipaddress.IPv4Address")
or [`IPv6Address`](#ipaddress.IPv6Address "ipaddress.IPv6Address") in the range. A [`TypeError`](exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") is raised if
*first* or *last* are not IP addresses or are not of the same version. A
[`ValueError`](exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised if *last* is not greater than *first* or if
*first* address version is not 4 or 6.

```
>>> [ipaddr for ipaddr in ipaddress.summarize_address_range(
...    ipaddress.IPv4Address('192.0.2.0'),
...    ipaddress.IPv4Address('192.0.2.130'))]
[IPv4Network('192.0.2.0/25'), IPv4Network('192.0.2.128/31'), IPv4Network('192.0.2.130/32')]

```

ipaddress.collapse\_addresses(*addresses*)[Â¶](#ipaddress.collapse_addresses "Link to this definition")

Return an iterator of the collapsed [`IPv4Network`](#ipaddress.IPv4Network "ipaddress.IPv4Network") or
[`IPv6Network`](#ipaddress.IPv6Network "ipaddress.IPv6Network") objects. *addresses* is an [iterable](../glossary.html#term-iterable) of
[`IPv4Network`](#ipaddress.IPv4Network "ipaddress.IPv4Network") or [`IPv6Network`](#ipaddress.IPv6Network "ipaddress.IPv6Network") objects. A [`TypeError`](exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") is
raised if *addresses* contains mixed version objects.

```
>>> [ipaddr for ipaddr in
... ipaddress.collapse_addresses([ipaddress.IPv4Network('192.0.2.0/25'),
... ipaddress.IPv4Network('192.0.2.128/25')])]
[IPv4Network('192.0.2.0/24')]

```

ipaddress.get\_mixed\_type\_key(*obj*)[Â¶](#ipaddress.get_mixed_type_key "Link to this definition")

Return a key suitable for sorting between networks and addresses. Address
and Network objects are not sortable by default; theyâre fundamentally
different, so the expression:

```
IPv4Address('192.0.2.0') <= IPv4Network('192.0.2.0/24')

```

doesnât make sense. There are some times however, where you may wish to
have [`ipaddress`](#module-ipaddress "ipaddress: IPv4/IPv6 manipulation library.") sort these anyway. If you need to do this, you can use
this function as the *key* argument to [`sorted()`](functions.html#sorted "sorted").

*obj* is either a network or address object.

## Custom Exceptions[Â¶](#custom-exceptions "Link to this heading")

To support more specific error reporting from class constructors, the
module defines the following exceptions:

*exception* ipaddress.AddressValueError(*ValueError*)[Â¶](#ipaddress.AddressValueError "Link to this definition")

Any value error related to the address.

*exception* ipaddress.NetmaskValueError(*ValueError*)[Â¶](#ipaddress.NetmaskValueError "Link to this definition")

Any value error related to the net mask.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 419 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2809080.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 18 new security patches for Oracle E-Business Suite.  4 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html#EBS)

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the October 2021 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (October 2021), [My Oracle Support Note 2484000.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2484000.1).

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 8 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.  5 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the October 2021 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager.

| ``` I understand to a certain extent the logic in not allowing IPv4 octets that might ambiguously be octal, but in practice, it just seems like it creates additional parsing hassle needlessly. I have never in many years of working on many networked systems seen anyone use dotted octal format, it is actually specifically forbidden by RFC 3986 (<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-7.4>), and it means that the ipaddress module throws exceptions on many perfectly valid IP addresses just because they have leading zeroes. Since the module doesn't support dotted octal or dotted hex anyway, this check seems a little pointless. If nothing else, there should be a way to disable this check by specifying that your IPs are in fact dotted decimal, otherwise it seems like it's just making you have to do extra parsing work or just write your own implementation. ``` | | | |

| ``` ipaddress is behaving as documented:  "The following constitutes a valid IPv4 address:  A string in decimal-dot notation, consisting of four decimal integers in the inclusive range 0–255, separated by dots (e.g. 192.168.0.1). Each integer represents an octet (byte) in the address. Leading zeroes are tolerated only for values less than 8 (as there is no ambiguity between the decimal and octal interpretations of such strings). [...]"  <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html>  I can sort of understand imposing that restriction in a Python 2 world where leading zeros implied octal and Python 3 outright rejects such forms of integers to avoid the ambiguity.  That said, there's no particular reason why the components of an IPv4 string acceptable to ipaddress *have* to follow the same rules so I'm +0 on making the change at all.  It's a bit of a stretch to consider it a bug when it appears to be behaving as documented but I would expect such a change to fix more problems than causing them so I'm OK if you want to backport it.  But, in any case, the documentation for 3.8 and/or 3.7 needs to be updated. ``` | | | |

| ``` The recommended handling in the article that Serhiy mentions is to strip the leading zeroes, which the ipaddress module will still do - it's only being made more tolerant on input. That means it will become usable as a prefilter step (pass string with potentially leading zeroes to ipaddress, get string with no leading zeroes out).  So that means the one part we missed is the docs update (together with a versionchanged note in the module docs themselves) ``` | | | |

| ``` (Copied from my comment on the PR, following the one where I said this was ready to go.)  Withdrawing the readiness - @ambv and I would prefer to see this behind a flag (probably "strict" parsing), on by default for 3.10, and maybe on by default for 3.9/earlier.  The main reasoning being that this isn't our vulnerability, but an inconsistency with other vulnerable libraries. The current fix is the best it can be, but it doesn't prevent the vulnerability, it just causes Python to break first. So it ought to be relatively easy to retain the flexible (though admittedly non-sensical) behaviour for those who currently rely on it. ``` | | | |

| ``` The important quote from the linked issue seems to be:  > Our new separator= parameter does not allow one to achieve the previous behavior if mixing and matching & And ; was intended to be allowed, as it is a single separator rather than a set of separators.  So arguably, we added _the wrong_ parameter in that case, because it only allowed choosing between behaviours not including the "bad" behaviour. We should've added one that was "give me back the previous behaviour".  In this case, having it off by default goes further to prevent breakage, and I wouldn't be opposed to a process level opt-in (e.g. a module-level flag), so that _applications_ have a way to force their dependencies to use the safer behaviour without needing to patch them. Similarly, a process level opt-out also seems good enough if we were to have it on by default. ``` | | | |

| ``` > In this case, having it off by default goes further to prevent breakage  PyYAML was unsafe by default: it allowed to execute arbitary Python code by default. It took years to change the default to "safe". I don't think that adding a parameter for opt-in for security is a good approach. An application can use ipaddress internally without being aware of using it, if it's done by a third party module. It's hard to prevent security vulnerabilities if people have to "opt-in" for security.  I prefer to break code and force people to manually get back the old behavior. It's better to make 90% safe by default but make 10% of people unhappy.  It's uncommon to pass IPv4 addresses with leading zeros.  If you want to tolerate leading zeros, you don't have to modify the ipaddress for that, you can pre-process your inputs: it works on any Python version with or without the fix.  >>> def reformat_ip(address): return '.'.join(part.lstrip('0') if part != '0' else part for part in address.split('.')) ...  >>> reformat_ip('0127.0.0.1') '127.0.0.1'  Or with an explicit loop for readability:  def reformat_ip(address):     parts = []     for part in address.split('.'):         if part != "0":             part = part.lstrip('0')         parts.append(part)     return '.'.join(parts) ``` | | | |

| ``` > If it takes years for users to get to 3.10, we should reevaluate our  > release cycle, not whether we aggressively break maintenance releases.  I don't really understand how that would help.  The problem is that users have major inertia for switching to newer Python versions.  A part of it is that a lot of people just don't care about deprecation warnings, and don't fix stuff until it's actually broken.  In the end, your projects are blocked from using new major Python version by broken dependencies with long release cycles.  I can't imagine deliberately leaving 3.8 and 3.9 vulnerable when 3.10 isn't going to reach final release in the next half year.  Gentoo stable is only switching to 3.9 next month.  I'm pretty sure some of our (few) corporate users are still on 3.7 or earlier.  Then, there are projects that literally include a vulnerable copy of Python 2.7 to get around distributions removing it.  I dare say this has less breakage potential than the &/; change.  It should be fixed on all affected versions.  If you don't do that, distributions will have to patch it anyway, and this will only lead to incompatibility between different Python package vendors. ``` | | | |

| ``` Due to the relative obscurity of the bug and potential disruption of the fix, I decided not to include it in 3.8.  However, Michał's argument about 3.10 not being released for another five months is resonating with me and so we will be backporting the change to 3.9.5, to be released tomorrow. Victor's argument about opt-ins being a bad way to fix security also makes sense, although let me point out that we've made decisions the other way in the past as well, for instance with hash randomization.  In any case, the issue will be solved in Python 3.10.0 Beta 1 and Python 3.9.5. Having the fixed behavior "in 3.9.5 and newer" makes for easy mechanical checks whether a given version is affected. ``` | | | |

IMHO I still think this should be solved in 3.8, otherwise there is really no other alternative but to upgrade to python 3.9 which is a hassle, since all 3.8.x are "critically vulnerable", had the CVE in <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29921> not been marked as critical, then we could have used python 3.8 knowing the two conditions you mentioned earlier. ``` | | | |

| I' leaving the whatsnew entry to release managers.  Usually, release managers don't maintain the What's New document. Since this change is backward incompatible, IMO it would deserve a "Notable changes in Python 3.x.y" in their What's New document in 3.6-3.9 branches. Example for a recent security fix: <https://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/3.7.html#notable-changes-in-python-3-7-10>  For Python 3.10, it can be written in the <https://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/3.10.html#changes-in-the-python-api> section. |

[@vstinner](https://github.com/vstinner), [@serhiy-storchaka](https://github.com/serhiy-storchaka), are you guys happy with the changes (pending the versionchanged being updated in each backport)? |

| Withdrawing the readiness - [@ambv](https://github.com/ambv) and I would prefer to see this behind a flag (probably "strict" parsing), on by default for 3.10, and maybe on by default for 3.9/earlier.  The main reasoning being that this isn't *our* vulnerability, but an inconsistency with other vulnerable libraries. The current fix is the best it can be, but it doesn't prevent the vulnerability, it just causes Python to break first. So it ought to be relatively easy to retain the flexible (though admittedly non-sensical) behaviour for those who currently rely on it. |

### **[bedevere-bot](/bedevere-bot)** commented [Aug 18, 2021](#issuecomment-900708736)

| ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Buildbot failure ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Hi! The buildbot **AMD64 Windows10 3.8** has failed when building commit [03dd89d](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/03dd89d62413c4a92831ed1b36e2ae8983bcb2d4).  What do you need to do:   1. Don't panic. 2. Check [the buildbot page in the devguide](https://devguide.python.org/buildbots/) if you don't know what the buildbots are or how they work. 3. Go to the page of the buildbot that failed (<https://buildbot.python.org/all/#builders/258/builds/43>) and take a look at the build logs. 4. Check if the failure is related to this commit ([03dd89d](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/03dd89d62413c4a92831ed1b36e2ae8983bcb2d4)) or if it is a false positive. 5. If the failure is related to this commit, please, reflect that on the issue and make a new Pull Request with a fix.   You can take a look at the buildbot page here:  <https://buildbot.python.org/all/#builders/258/builds/43>  Failed tests:   * test\_compile   Failed subtests:   * test\_stack\_overflow - test.test\_compile.TestSpecifics * test\_no\_args\_respects\_force\_flag - test.test\_compileall.CommmandLineTestsNoSourceEpoch   Summary of the results of the build (if available):  == Tests result: FAILURE then FAILURE ==  392 tests OK.  10 slowest tests:   * test\_multiprocessing\_spawn: 3 min 9 sec * test\_tokenize: 2 min 43 sec * test\_tools: 2 min 21 sec * test\_concurrent\_futures: 1 min 52 sec * test\_mmap: 1 min 43 sec * test\_lib2to3: 1 min 24 sec * test\_asyncio: 1 min 11 sec * test\_io: 1 min 9 sec * test\_socket: 1 min * test\_pickle: 52.2 sec   1 test failed: test\_compile  30 tests skipped: test\_curses test\_dbm\_gnu test\_dbm\_ndbm test\_devpoll test\_epoll test\_fcntl test\_fork1 test\_gdb test\_grp test\_ioctl test\_kqueue test\_multiprocessing\_fork test\_multiprocessing\_forkserver test\_nis test\_openpty test\_ossaudiodev test\_pipes test\_poll test\_posix test\_pty test\_pwd test\_readline test\_resource test\_spwd test\_syslog test\_threadsignals test\_wait3 test\_wait4 test\_xxtestfuzz test\_zipfile64  2 re-run tests: test\_compile test\_compileall  Total duration: 11 min 21 sec  Click to see traceback logs ``` Traceback (most recent call last):   File "D:\buildarea\3.8.bolen-windows10\build\lib\test\test_py_compile.py", line 22, in wrapper     return fxn(*args, **kwargs)   File "D:\buildarea\3.8.bolen-windows10\build\lib\test\test_py_compile.py", line 22, in wrapper     return fxn(*args, **kwargs)   File "D:\buildarea\3.8.bolen-windows10\build\lib\test\test_compileall.py", line 322, in test_no_args_respects_force_flag     self.assertRunOK('-f', PYTHONPATH=self.directory)   File "D:\buildarea\3.8.bolen-windows10\build\lib\test\test_compileall.py", line 271, in assertRunOK     rc, out, err = script_helper.assert_python_ok(   File "D:\buildarea\3.8.bolen-windows10\build\lib\test\support\script_helper.py", line 157, in assert_python_ok     return _assert_python(True, *args, **env_vars)   File "D:\buildarea\3.8.bolen-windows10\build\lib\test\support\script_helper.py", line 143, in _assert_python     res.fail(cmd_line)   File "D:\buildarea\3.8.bolen-windows10\build\lib\test\support\script_helper.py", line 70, in fail     raise AssertionError("Process return code is %d\n" AssertionError: Process return code is 1 command line: ['D:\\buildarea\\3.8.bolen-windows10\\build\\PCbuild\\amd64\\python_d.exe', '-X', 'faulthandler', '-S', '-m', 'compileall', '-f']   Traceback (most recent call last):   File "D:\buildarea\3.8.bolen-windows10\build\lib\test\test_compile.py", line 698, in test_stack_overflow     compile("if a: b\n" * 200000, "<dummy>", "exec") MemoryError  ``` |

|  |  | Notable changes in Python 3.8.12 |
|  |  | ================================ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Starting with Python 3.8.12 the :mod:`ipaddress` module no longer accepts |
|  |  | any leading zeros in IPv4 address strings. Leading zeros are ambiguous and |
|  |  | interpreted as octal notation by some libraries. For example the legacy |
|  |  | function :func:`socket.inet\_aton` treats leading zeros as octal notation. |
|  |  | glibc implementation of modern :func:`~socket.inet\_pton` does not accept |
|  |  | any leading zeros. |

### Title

python stdlib "ipaddress" - Improper Input Validation of octal literals in python 3.8.0 thru v3.10 results in indeterminate SSRF & RFI vulnerabilities. -- "ipaddress leading zeros in IPv4 address"

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-29921

### CVSS Score

9.8 CRITICAL

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### Internal ID

SICK-2021-014

### Vendor

python

### Product

ipaddress stdlib

### Product Versions

3.8.0 thru v3.10

### Vulnerability Details

Improper input validation of octal strings in Python 3.8.0 thru v3.10 stdlib ipaddress allows unauthenticated remote attackers to perform indeterminate SSRF, RFI, and LFI attacks on many programs that rely on Python stdlib ipaddress. IP address octects are left stripped instead of evaluated as valid IP addresses. For example, an attacker submitting an IP address to a web application that relies on stdlib ipaddress, could cause SSRF via inputting octal input data; An attacker can submit exploitable IP addresses if the octet is 3 digits, with the minimum exploitable octect being 08 (Denial of Service) and the maximum exploitable octet is 099. For example, an attacker can submit 010.8.8.8, which is 8.8.8.8, yet Python ipaddress builtin will evaluate this as 10.8.8.8.

### Vendor Response

Currently unpatched - due to be addressed in next release.

### Proof of Concept

Vulnerability added in python3.8

[python/cpython#12577](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/12577)

Documentated to be vulnerable in the changelog:

<https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/63298930fb531ba2bb4f23bc3b915dbf1e17e9e1/Misc/NEWS.d/3.8.0a4.rst>

*Stop rejecting IPv4 octets for being ambiguously octal. Leading zeros are ignored, and no longer are assumed to specify octal octets. Octets are always decimal numbers. Octets must still be no more than three digits, including leading zeroes.*

|  |  |  |
|  |  | Starting with Python 3.8.12 the :mod:`ipaddress` module no longer accepts |
|  |  | any leading zeros in IPv4 address strings. Leading zeros are ambiguous and |
|  |  | interpreted as octal notation by some libraries. For example the legacy |

parsing even more strict. Like socket.inet_pton() any leading zero
is now treated as invalid input.

|  |  | Starting with Python 3.8.12 the :mod:`ipaddress` module no longer accepts |

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 520 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2857016.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 54 new security patches plus additional third party patches noted below for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  41 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html#FMW)

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security updates are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the Critical Patch Update April 2022 to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2022 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2853458.2](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2853458.2).

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

[bpo-36384](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=36384): Remove check for leading zeroes in IPv4 addresses ([GH-12577](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/12577))

```
Stop rejecting IPv4 octets with leading zeroes as ambiguously octal.

Plenty of other tools generate decimal IPv4 octets with leading zeroes,
so keeping this check hurts interoperability.

Patch by Joel Croteau.

Reverts commit [e653d4d](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/e653d4d8e820a7a004ad399530af0135b45db27a) and makes
parsing even more strict. Like socket.inet_pton() any leading zero
is now treated as invalid input.

Reverts commit [e653d4d](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/e653d4d8e820a7a004ad399530af0135b45db27a) and makes
parsing even more strict. Like socket.inet_pton() any leading zero
is now treated as invalid input.

|  |  | Notable changes in Python 3.8.12 |
|  |  | ================================ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Starting with Python 3.8.12 the :mod:`ipaddress` module no longer accepts |
|  |  | any leading zeros in IPv4 address strings. Leading zeros are ambiguous and |
|  |  | interpreted as octal notation by some libraries. For example the legacy |
|  |  | function :func:`socket.inet\_aton` treats leading zeros as octal notation. |
|  |  | glibc implementation of modern :func:`~socket.inet\_pton` does not accept |
|  |  | any leading zeros. |

parsing even more strict. Like socket.inet_pton() any leading zero
is now treated as invalid input.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 497 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [January 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2832416.1).

**Please note that on December 10, 2021, Oracle released a Security Alert for Apache Log4j vulnerabilities [CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2021-44228.html). Customers should review the Alert if they have not already done so.**

### Affected Products and Patch Information

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed below. The product area is shown in the Patch Availability Document column.

**Please click on the links in the Patch Availability Document column below to access the documentation for patch availability information and installation instructions.**

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 7 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.  6 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpujan2022verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the January 2022 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update January 2022 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2817011.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2817011.1).

Thank you for the backport. We need two more things. The first is mentioned in an inline comment. And the second is about "What's New". See how [GH-25099](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/25099) also touches `Doc/whatsnew/3.9.rst`? This backport will need to do the same for `Doc/whatsnew/3.8.rst`, adding "Notable Changes in Python 3.8.12". You can copy the text verbatim from the respective whatsnew edit in [GH-25099](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/25099).

Sorry, something went wrong.

| [@achraf-mer](https://github.com/achraf-mer), assuming all tests pass on this PR, I will merge it. It will be released as Python 3.8.12 on August 30th alongside Python 3.9.7. I will also make pull requests to the 3.9, 3.10, and main (3.11) branches to amend the `.. versionchanged:: 3.8.12` information you provide here in the docs of those respective branches, to make this information easier to find.  This PR is currently the only fix slated for 3.8.12 (there are literally only 3 other commits on the branch, two are doc updates and one is a test improvement).  Not sure how soon conda will release 3.8.12. Looking at 3.8.11, it took them 37 days from release (2021-06-28) to availability on <https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python/files> (2021-08-04). |

| ``` I understand to a certain extent the logic in not allowing IPv4 octets that might ambiguously be octal, but in practice, it just seems like it creates additional parsing hassle needlessly. I have never in many years of working on many networked systems seen anyone use dotted octal format, it is actually specifically forbidden by RFC 3986 (<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-7.4>), and it means that the ipaddress module throws exceptions on many perfectly valid IP addresses just because they have leading zeroes. Since the module doesn't support dotted octal or dotted hex anyway, this check seems a little pointless. If nothing else, there should be a way to disable this check by specifying that your IPs are in fact dotted decimal, otherwise it seems like it's just making you have to do extra parsing work or just write your own implementation. ``` | | | |

| ``` ipaddress is behaving as documented:  "The following constitutes a valid IPv4 address:  A string in decimal-dot notation, consisting of four decimal integers in the inclusive range 0–255, separated by dots (e.g. 192.168.0.1). Each integer represents an octet (byte) in the address. Leading zeroes are tolerated only for values less than 8 (as there is no ambiguity between the decimal and octal interpretations of such strings). [...]"  <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html>  I can sort of understand imposing that restriction in a Python 2 world where leading zeros implied octal and Python 3 outright rejects such forms of integers to avoid the ambiguity.  That said, there's no particular reason why the components of an IPv4 string acceptable to ipaddress *have* to follow the same rules so I'm +0 on making the change at all.  It's a bit of a stretch to consider it a bug when it appears to be behaving as documented but I would expect such a change to fix more problems than causing them so I'm OK if you want to backport it.  But, in any case, the documentation for 3.8 and/or 3.7 needs to be updated. ``` | | | |

This is still true in Windows 10.  So it is safer to reject IPv4 addresses with leading zeros that can be ambiguously interpreted. Otherwise this can create a security hole. ``` | | | |

| ``` The recommended handling in the article that Serhiy mentions is to strip the leading zeroes, which the ipaddress module will still do - it's only being made more tolerant on input. That means it will become usable as a prefilter step (pass string with potentially leading zeroes to ipaddress, get string with no leading zeroes out).  So that means the one part we missed is the docs update (together with a versionchanged note in the module docs themselves) ``` | | | |

| ``` Serhiy was right, this is a security issue.  The patch should not have landed in 3.8. At a bare minimum the patch should have been postponed until documentation was updated. Since 3.8 the ipaddresss does not behave as documented. A similar security issue in NPM was published two days ago, CVE-2021-28918.  I proposed to not only revert the change, but also tighten the check for leading zeros so it behaves like glibc's inet_pton(). It refuses any IPv4 string with a leading zero.  >>> socket.inet_pton(socket.AF_INET, "01.1.1.1") Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> OSError: illegal IP address string passed to inet_pton >>> socket.inet_pton(socket.AF_INET, "1.1.1.01") Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> OSError: illegal IP address string passed to inet_pton ``` | | | |

| ``` (Copied from my comment on the PR, following the one where I said this was ready to go.)  Withdrawing the readiness - @ambv and I would prefer to see this behind a flag (probably "strict" parsing), on by default for 3.10, and maybe on by default for 3.9/earlier.  The main reasoning being that this isn't our vulnerability, but an inconsistency with other vulnerable libraries. The current fix is the best it can be, but it doesn't prevent the vulnerability, it just causes Python to break first. So it ought to be relatively easy to retain the flexible (though admittedly non-sensical) behaviour for those who currently rely on it. ``` | | | |

| ``` The important quote from the linked issue seems to be:  > Our new separator= parameter does not allow one to achieve the previous behavior if mixing and matching & And ; was intended to be allowed, as it is a single separator rather than a set of separators.  So arguably, we added _the wrong_ parameter in that case, because it only allowed choosing between behaviours not including the "bad" behaviour. We should've added one that was "give me back the previous behaviour".  In this case, having it off by default goes further to prevent breakage, and I wouldn't be opposed to a process level opt-in (e.g. a module-level flag), so that _applications_ have a way to force their dependencies to use the safer behaviour without needing to patch them. Similarly, a process level opt-out also seems good enough if we were to have it on by default. ``` | | | |

| ``` > In this case, having it off by default goes further to prevent breakage  PyYAML was unsafe by default: it allowed to execute arbitary Python code by default. It took years to change the default to "safe". I don't think that adding a parameter for opt-in for security is a good approach. An application can use ipaddress internally without being aware of using it, if it's done by a third party module. It's hard to prevent security vulnerabilities if people have to "opt-in" for security.  I prefer to break code and force people to manually get back the old behavior. It's better to make 90% safe by default but make 10% of people unhappy.  It's uncommon to pass IPv4 addresses with leading zeros.  If you want to tolerate leading zeros, you don't have to modify the ipaddress for that, you can pre-process your inputs: it works on any Python version with or without the fix.  >>> def reformat_ip(address): return '.'.join(part.lstrip('0') if part != '0' else part for part in address.split('.')) ...  >>> reformat_ip('0127.0.0.1') '127.0.0.1'  Or with an explicit loop for readability:  def reformat_ip(address):     parts = []     for part in address.split('.'):         if part != "0":             part = part.lstrip('0')         parts.append(part)     return '.'.join(parts) ``` | | | |

| ``` > If it takes years for users to get to 3.10, we should reevaluate our  > release cycle, not whether we aggressively break maintenance releases.  I don't really understand how that would help.  The problem is that users have major inertia for switching to newer Python versions.  A part of it is that a lot of people just don't care about deprecation warnings, and don't fix stuff until it's actually broken.  In the end, your projects are blocked from using new major Python version by broken dependencies with long release cycles.  I can't imagine deliberately leaving 3.8 and 3.9 vulnerable when 3.10 isn't going to reach final release in the next half year.  Gentoo stable is only switching to 3.9 next month.  I'm pretty sure some of our (few) corporate users are still on 3.7 or earlier.  Then, there are projects that literally include a vulnerable copy of Python 2.7 to get around distributions removing it.  I dare say this has less breakage potential than the &/; change.  It should be fixed on all affected versions.  If you don't do that, distributions will have to patch it anyway, and this will only lead to incompatibility between different Python package vendors. ``` | | | |

| ``` Due to the relative obscurity of the bug and potential disruption of the fix, I decided not to include it in 3.8.  However, Michał's argument about 3.10 not being released for another five months is resonating with me and so we will be backporting the change to 3.9.5, to be released tomorrow. Victor's argument about opt-ins being a bad way to fix security also makes sense, although let me point out that we've made decisions the other way in the past as well, for instance with hash randomization.  In any case, the issue will be solved in Python 3.10.0 Beta 1 and Python 3.9.5. Having the fixed behavior "in 3.9.5 and newer" makes for easy mechanical checks whether a given version is affected. ``` | | | |

Our understanding is that this is a low-severity CVE because in order for this to be a vulnerability, you'd have to have both:  1. user access to IP address input; and 2. control over two addresses sharing numerical representation with leading zeroes: the first resolving when leading zeroes are treated as octal numbers; the second resolving when leading zeroes are treated as decimal numbers.  Access to both then allows you at best to circumvent IP address-based access control or denial of service. However, access to just 1. allows you to input any IP address to achieve the same goals.  Hence low-severity.   > it does not seem to be a breaking change  It is a bona fide breaking change. Any IP address configuration saved in files or databases which might have used leading zeroes would be rejected by 3.8.12. The same was true for 3.9.5 but since this release series has much higher exposure (still receiving binary installers and regular-cadence bugfixes), it was less controversial to include it.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 349 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2880220.1).

**Please note that since the release of the April 2022 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released a Security Alert for Oracle E-Business Suite [CVE-2022-21500 (May 19, 2022)](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2022-21500.html). Customers are strongly advised to apply the July 2022 Critical Patch Update for Oracle E-Business Suite, which includes patches for this Alert as well as additional patches.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

Fixes mishandling of pre-normalization characters in urlsplit().

Address CVE-2019-9740 by disallowing URL paths with embedded whitespace or
control characters through into the underlying http client request. Such
potentially malicious header injection URLs now cause an
http.client.InvalidURL exception to be raised.

[:func:`shutil.which`](#id1) now uses `os.confstr("CS_PATH")` if available and if
the [:envvar:`PATH`](#id3) environment variable is not set. Remove also the current
directory from [:data:`posixpath.defpath`](#id5). On Unix, [:func:`shutil.which`](#id7) and
the [:mod:`subprocess`](#id9) module no longer search the executable in the current
directory if the [:envvar:`PATH`](#id11) environment variable is not set.

In debug build, import now also looks for C extensions compiled in release
mode and for C extensions compiled in the stable ABI.

Fix Python Initialization code on FreeBSD to detect properly when stdin file
descriptor (fd 0) is invalid.

Remove parser headers and related function declarations that lack
implementations after the removal of pgen.

`dict.pop()` is now up to 33% faster thanks to Argument Clinic. Patch by
Inada Naoki.

Debug memory allocators: disable serialno field by default from debug hooks
on Python memory allocators to reduce the memory footprint by 5%. Enable
[:mod:`tracemalloc`](#id13) to get the traceback where a memory block has been
allocated when a fatal memory error is logged to decide where to put a
breakpoint. Compile Python with `PYMEM_DEBUG_SERIALNO` defined to get back
the field.

On AIX, [:attr:`sys.platform`](#id15) doesn't contain the major version anymore.
Always return `'aix'`, instead of `'aix3'` .. `'aix7'`. Since older
Python versions include the version number, it is recommended to always use
`sys.platform.startswith('aix')`. Contributed by M. Felt.

Change str.capitalize to use titlecase for the first character instead of
uppercase.

Implement [PEP 570](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0570) (Python positional-only parameters). Patch by Pablo
Galindo.

[:c:func:`PyEval\_AcquireLock`](#id17) and [:c:func:`PyEval\_AcquireThread`](#id19) now
terminate the current thread if called while the interpreter is finalizing,
making them consistent with [:c:func:`PyEval\_RestoreThread`](#id21),
[:c:func:`Py\_END\_ALLOW\_THREADS`](#id23), and [:c:func:`PyGILState\_Ensure`](#id25).

Fix signed integer overflow in \_ctypes.c's `PyCArrayType_new()`.

Fix running script with encoding cookie and LF line ending may fail on
Windows.

Fixed support of the surrogatepass error handler in the UTF-8 incremental
decoder.

Changing `dict` keys during iteration of the dict itself, `keys()`,
`values()`, or `items()` will now be detected in certain corner cases
where keys are deleted/added so that the number of keys isn't changed. A
RuntimeError will be raised after `len(dict)` iterations. Contributed by
Thomas Perl.

Fix a possible double `PyMem_FREE()` due to tokenizer.c's `tok_nextc()`.

Fixed TypeError message in classmethoddescr\_call.

Fix a possible reference leak in [:func:`itertools.count`](#id27).

Include node names in `ParserError` messages, instead of numeric IDs.
Patch by A. Skrobov.

Regenerate [:mod:`keyword`](#id29) from the Grammar and Tokens file using pgen. Patch
by Pablo Galindo.

Add missing [:c:func:`PyObject\_GC\_Track`](#id31) calls in the [:mod:`pickle`](#id33) module.
Patch by Zackery Spytz.

Fix pythoninfo when the compiler is missing.

The `.find*()` methods of xml.etree.ElementTree can now search for
wildcards like `{*}tag` and `{ns}*` that match a tag in any namespace or
all tags in a namespace. Patch by Stefan Behnel.

pathlib.path.link\_to() is now implemented. It creates a hard link pointing
to a path.

[:class:`fileinput.FileInput`](#id35) now uses the input file mode to correctly set
the output file mode (previously it was hardcoded to `'w'`) when
`inplace=True` is passed to its constructor.

Fix compilation of `faulthandler.c` on HP-UX. Initialize `stack_t
current_stack` to zero using `memset()`.

The xml.etree.ElementTree packages gained support for C14N 2.0
serialisation. Patch by Stefan Behnel.

Add missing matrix multiplication operator support to weakref.proxy.

The XMLParser() in xml.etree.ElementTree provides namespace prefix context
to the parser target if it defines the callback methods "start\_ns()" and/or
"end\_ns()". Patch by Stefan Behnel.

The TreeBuilder and XMLPullParser in xml.etree.ElementTree gained support
for parsing comments and processing instructions. Patch by Stefan Behnel.

The C version of functools.lru\_cache() was treating calls with an empty
`**kwargs` dictionary as being distinct from calls with no keywords at
all. This did not result in an incorrect answer, but it did trigger an
unexpected cache miss.

Fix [:mod:`distutils.sysconfig`](#id37) if [:data:`sys.executable`](#id39) is `None` or an
empty string: use [:func:`os.getcwd`](#id41) to initialize `project_base`. Fix
also the distutils build command: don't use [:data:`sys.executable`](#id43) if it is
`None` or an empty string.

[:func:`shutil.which`](#id45) and [:func:`distutils.spawn.find\_executable`](#id47) now use
`os.confstr("CS_PATH")` if available instead of [:data:`os.defpath`](#id49), if the
`PATH` environment variable is not set. Moreover, don't use
`os.confstr("CS_PATH")` nor [:data:`os.defpath`](#id51) if the `PATH` environment
variable is set to an empty string.

improve performance of `IPNetwork.__contains__()`

Path expressions in xml.etree.ElementTree can now avoid explicit namespace
prefixes for tags (or the "{namespace}tag" notation) by passing a default
namespace with an empty string prefix.

Fix [:mod:`asyncio`](#id53) wait() not removing callback if exception

Fix `isinstance` check for Mock objects with spec when the code is
executed under tracing. Patch by Karthikeyan Singaravelan.

In development mode ([:option:`-X`](#id55) `dev`) and in debug build, the
[:class:`io.IOBase`](#id57) destructor now logs `close()` exceptions. These
exceptions are silent by default in release mode.

The `_lsprof` module now uses internal timer same to
`time.perf_counter()` by default. `gettimeofday(2)` was used on Unix.
New timer has better resolution on most Unix platforms and timings are no
longer impacted by system clock updates since `perf_counter()` is
monotonic. Patch by Inada Naoki.

`json.loads` now emits `DeprecationWarning` when `encoding` option is
specified. Patch by Matthias Bussonnier.

The random module now prefers the lean internal \_sha512 module over hashlib
for seed(version=2) to optimize import time.

Set backlog=None as the default for socket.create\_server.

Fix [:func:`time.mktime`](#id59) error handling on AIX for year before 1970.

Improve error message when trying to open existing DBM database that
actually doesn't exist. Patch by Marco Rougeth.

Add statistics.quantiles()

Optimized `http.client.HTTPResponse.read()` for large response. Patch by
Inada Naoki.

If *debuglevel* is set to >0 in [:mod:`http.client`](#id61), print all values for
headers with multiple values for the same header name. Patch by Matt
Houglum.

Deprecated passing required arguments like *func* as keyword arguments in
functions which should accept arbitrary keyword arguments and pass them to
other function. Arbitrary keyword arguments (even with names "self" and
"func") can now be passed to these functions if the required arguments are
passed as positional arguments.

Add statistics.geometric\_mean().

`os.path.normcase()` relies on `os.fspath()` to check the type of its
argument. Redundant checks have been removed from its
`posixpath.normcase()` and `ntpath.normcase()` implementations. Patch by
Wolfgang Maier.

Stop rejecting IPv4 octets for being ambiguously octal. Leading zeros are
ignored, and no longer are assumed to specify octal octets. Octets are
always decimal numbers. Octets must still be no more than three digits,
including leading zeroes.

Errors during writing to a ZIP file no longer prevent to properly close it.

Fixed wrong indentation writing for CDATA section in xml.dom.minidom. Patch
by Vladimir Surjaninov.

inspect.getdoc() can now find docstrings for member objects when \_\_slots\_\_
is a dictionary.

Calling `stop()` on an unstarted or stopped [:func:`unittest.mock.patch`](#id63)
object will now return None instead of raising [:exc:`RuntimeError`](#id65), making
the method idempotent. Patch by Karthikeyan Singaravelan.

The [:meth:`imap.IMAP4.logout`](#id67) method no longer ignores silently arbitrary
exceptions.

Add time module support and fix test\_time faiures for VxWorks.

Added support for keyword arguments default\_namespace and
xml\_declaration in functions ElementTree.tostring() and
ElementTree.tostringlist().

Added new alternate constructors [:meth:`datetime.date.fromisocalendar`](#id69) and
[:meth:`datetime.datetime.fromisocalendar`](#id71), which construct date objects from
ISO year, week number and weekday; these are the inverse of each class's
`isocalendar` method. Patch by Paul Ganssle.

[:mod:`modulefinder`](#id73) no longer depends on the deprecated [:mod:`imp`](#id75) module,
and the initializer for [:class:`modulefinder.ModuleFinder`](#id77) now has immutable
default arguments. Patch by Brandt Bucher.

[:mod:`modulefinder`](#id79) correctly handles modules that have the same name as a
bad package. Patch by Brandt Bucher.

[:mod:`modulefinder`](#id81) no longer crashes when encountering syntax errors in
followed imports. Patch by Brandt Bucher.

Added [:meth:`~socket.create\_server()`](#id83) and
[:meth:`~socket.has\_dualstack\_ipv6()`](#id85) convenience functions to automate the
necessary tasks usually involved when creating a server socket, including
accepting both IPv4 and IPv6 connections on the same socket. (Contributed
by Giampaolo Rodola in [:issue:`17561`](#id87).)

Add support for [:func:`classmethod`](#id89) and [:func:`staticmethod`](#id91) to
[:func:`unittest.mock.create\_autospec`](#id93). Initial patch by Felipe Ochoa.

Fix potential resource warnings in distutils. Patch by Mickaël Schoentgen.

Add transparency methods to [:class:`tkinter.PhotoImage`](#id95). Patch by Zackery
Spytz.

Don't return deleted attributes when calling dir on a
[:class:`unittest.mock.Mock`](#id97).

[:class:`wsgiref.handlers.BaseHandler`](#id99) now handles abrupt client connection
terminations gracefully. Patch by Petter Strandmark.

[:func:`xml.sax.parse`](#id101) now supports [:term:`path-like <path-like object>`](#id103).
Patch by Mickaël Schoentgen.

Remove stale unix datagram socket before binding

Implemented Happy Eyeballs in asyncio.create\_connection(). Added two new
arguments, *happy\_eyeballs\_delay* and *interleave*, to specify Happy
Eyeballs behavior.

Do not raise AttributeError when calling the inspect functions
isgeneratorfunction, iscoroutinefunction, isasyncgenfunction on a method
created from an arbitrary callable. Instead, return False.

Fix the multiprocessing.semaphore\_tracker so it is reused by child processes

Fix `setup.py check --restructuredtext` for files containing `include`
directives.

Remove obsolete comments from docstrings in fractions.Fraction

Document relative imports

Add docstring for io.IOBase.writelines().

New documentation translation: [Simplified Chinese](https://docs.python.org/zh-cn/).

Avoid the duplication of code from `Tools/scripts/serve.py` in using the
[:rst:dir:`literalinclude`](#id105) directive for the basic wsgiref-based web server
in the documentation of [:mod:`wsgiref`](#id107). Contributed by Stéphane Wirtel.

Using the code of the `Tools/scripts/serve.py` script as an example in the
[:mod:`wsgiref`](#id109) documentation. Contributed by Stéphane Wirtel.

Added Documention for PyInterpreterState\_Main().

Updates the docs.python.org page with the addition of a 'Contributing to
Docs' link at the end of the page (between 'Reporting Bugs' and 'About
Documentation'). Updates the 'Found a Bug' page with additional links and
information in the Documentation Bugs section.

@typing.type\_check\_only now allows type stubs to mark functions and classes
not available during runtime.

Add glossary entry for 'magic method'.

Added re.Match.groupdict example to regex HOWTO.

regrtest now always detects uncollectable objects. Previously, the check was
only enabled by `--findleaks`. The check now also works with
`-jN/--multiprocess N`. `--findleaks` becomes a deprecated alias to
`--fail-env-changed`.

When using multiprocessing mode (-jN), regrtest now better reports errors if
a worker process fails, and it exits immediately on a worker thread failure
or when interrupted.

Change test\_time.test\_monotonic() to test only the lower bound of elapsed
time after a sleep command rather than the upper bound. This prevents
unnecessary test failures on slow buildbots. Patch by Victor Stinner.

Improve test coverage for xml.etree.ElementTree. Patch by Gordon P. Hemsley.

Fix typo in test\_cyclic\_gc() test for xml.etree.ElementTree. Patch by Gordon
P. Hemsley.

Add a new [:mod:`\_testinternalcapi`](#id111) module to test the internal C API.

Fix `test_imap4_host_default_value()` of `test_imaplib`: catch also
[:data:`errno.ENETUNREACH`](#id113) error.

Fix `test_sys.test_getallocatedblocks()` when [:mod:`tracemalloc`](#id115) is
enabled.

Fix reference leak hunting in regrtest: compute also deltas (of reference
count, allocated memory blocks, file descriptor count) during warmup, to
ensure that everything is initialized before starting to hunt reference
leaks.

Fix reference hunting (`python3 -m test -R 3:3`) when Python has no
built-in abc module.

Port test\_resource to VxWorks: skip tests cases setting RLIMIT\_FSIZE and
RLIMIT\_CPU.

Fix test\_tabnanny on VxWorks: adjust ENOENT error message.

Fix `_testcapi.pymem_buffer_overflow()`: handle memory allocation failure.

Fix test\_utf8\_mode on VxWorks: Python always use UTF-8 on VxWorks.

Fix tests that may fail with PermissionError upon calling bind() on AF\_UNIX
sockets.

Remove the stale scriptsinstall Makefile target.

On Unix, C extensions are no longer linked to libpython except on Android
and Cygwin.

It is now possible for a statically linked Python to load a C extension
built using a shared library Python.

When Python is embedded, `libpython` must not be loaded with
`RTLD_LOCAL`, but `RTLD_GLOBAL` instead. Previously, using
`RTLD_LOCAL`, it was already not possible to load C extensions which were
not linked to `libpython`, such as C extensions of the standard library
built by the `*shared*` section of `Modules/Setup`.

distutils, python-config and python-config.py have been modified.

`./configure --with-pymalloc` no longer adds the `m` flag to SOABI
(sys.implementation.cache\_tag). Enabling or disabling pymalloc has no impact
on the ABI.

Change `PyAPI_FUNC(type)`, `PyAPI_DATA(type)` and `PyMODINIT_FUNC`
macros of `pyport.h` when `Py_BUILD_CORE_MODULE` is defined. The
`Py_BUILD_CORE_MODULE` define must be now be used to build a C extension
as a dynamic library accessing Python internals: export the PyInit\_xxx()
function in DLL exports on Windows.

Don't build the `_crypt` extension on VxWorks.

Add `-fmax-type-align=8` to CFLAGS when clang compiler is detected. The
pymalloc memory allocator aligns memory on 8 bytes. On x86-64, clang expects
alignment on 16 bytes by default and so uses MOVAPS instruction which can
lead to segmentation fault. Instruct clang that Python is limited to
alignment on 8 bytes to use MOVUPS instruction instead: slower but don't
trigger a SIGSEGV if the memory is not aligned on 16 bytes. Sadly, the flag
must be added to `CFLAGS` and not just `CFLAGS_NODIST`, since third
party C extensions can have the same issue.

`make tags` and `make TAGS` now also parse `Modules/_io/*.c` and
`Modules/_io/*.h`.

Release builds and debug builds are now ABI compatible: defining the
`Py_DEBUG` macro no longer implies the `Py_TRACE_REFS` macro, which
introduces the only ABI incompatibility. The `Py_TRACE_REFS` macro, which
adds the [:func:`sys.getobjects`](#id117) function and the [:envvar:`PYTHONDUMPREFS`](#id119)
environment variable, can be set using the new `./configure
--with-trace-refs` build option.

setup.py now correctly reports missing OpenSSL headers and libraries again.

Fix regression introduced in bpo-36146 refactoring setup.py

`python-config --ldflags` no longer includes flags of the
`LINKFORSHARED` variable. The `LINKFORSHARED` variable must only be used
to build executables.

Remove references to "aix3" and "aix4". Patch by M. Felt.

Added platform.win32\_edition() and platform.win32\_is\_iot(). Added support
for cross-compiling packages for Windows ARM32. Skip tests that are not
expected to work on Windows IoT Core ARM32.

Remove trailing spaces for registry keys when installed via the Store.

Fixed activate.bat to correctly update codepage when chcp.com returns dots
in output. Patch by Lorenz Mende.

Added preset-iot layout for Windows IoT ARM containers. This layout doesn't
contain UI components like tkinter or IDLE. It also doesn't contain files to
support on-target builds since Windows ARM32 builds must be cross-compiled
when using MSVC.

enum\_certificates function of the ssl module now returns certificates from
all available certificate stores inside windows in a query instead of
returning only certificates from the system wide certificate store. This
includes certificates from these certificate stores: local machine, local
machine enterprise, local machine group policy, current user, current user
group policy, services, users. ssl.enum\_crls() function is changed in the
same way to return all certificate revocation lists inside the windows
certificate revocation list stores.

Fixes creating a venv when debug binaries are installed.

Enable better DLL resolution on Windows by using safe DLL search paths and
adding [:func:`os.add\_dll\_directory`](#id121).

Add the venv standard library module to the nuget distribution for Windows.

Add the following socket module constants on Windows: IPPROTO\_AH IPPROTO\_CBT
IPPROTO\_DSTOPTS IPPROTO\_EGP IPPROTO\_ESP IPPROTO\_FRAGMENT IPPROTO\_GGP
IPPROTO\_HOPOPTS IPPROTO\_ICLFXBM IPPROTO\_ICMPV6 IPPROTO\_IDP IPPROTO\_IGMP
IPPROTO\_IGP IPPROTO\_IPV4 IPPROTO\_IPV6 IPPROTO\_L2TP IPPROTO\_MAX IPPROTO\_ND
IPPROTO\_NONE IPPROTO\_PGM IPPROTO\_PIM IPPROTO\_PUP IPPROTO\_RDP IPPROTO\_ROUTING
IPPROTO\_SCTP IPPROTO\_ST

Added current version of libffi to cpython-source-deps. Change \_ctypes to
use current version of libffi on Windows.

Report system load when running test suite on Windows. Patch by Ammar Askar.
Based on prior work by Jeremy Kloth.

With the Windows 10 Creators Update, non-elevated users can now create
symlinks as long as the computer has Developer Mode enabled.

Avoid failures setting macOS stack resource limit with resource.setrlimit.
This reverts an earlier fix for bpo-18075 which forced a non-default stack
size when building the interpreter executable on macOS.

Fix starting IDLE with pyshell. Add idlelib.pyshell alias at top; remove
pyshell alias at bottom. Remove obsolete \_\_name\_\_=='\_\_main\_\_' command.

Fix the argument handling in Tools/scripts/lll.py.

Fix memory leak in [:c:func:`Py\_SetStandardStreamEncoding`](#id123): release memory if
the function is called twice.

[:c:macro:`PyDoc\_VAR(name)`](#id125) and [:c:macro:`PyDoc\_STRVAR(name,str)`](#id127) now create
`static const char name[]` instead of `static char name[]`. Patch by
Inada Naoki.

Change the value of `CLEANBYTE`, `DEADDYTE` and `FORBIDDENBYTE`
internal constants used by debug hooks on Python memory allocators
([:c:func:`PyMem\_SetupDebugHooks`](#id129) function). Byte patterns `0xCB`, `0xDB`
and `0xFB` have been replaced with `0xCD`, `0xDD` and `0xFD` to use
the same values than Windows CRT debug `malloc()` and `free()`.

Since Python 3.7.0, calling [:c:func:`Py\_DecodeLocale`](#id131) before
[:c:func:`Py\_Initialize`](#id133) produces mojibake if the `LC_CTYPE` locale is
coerced and/or if the UTF-8 Mode is enabled by the user configuration. The
LC\_CTYPE coercion and UTF-8 Mode are now disabled by default to fix the
mojibake issue. They must now be enabled explicitly (opt-in) using the new
[:c:func:`\_Py\_PreInitialize`](#id135) API with `_PyPreConfig`.

Fixed an accidental change to the datetime C API where the arguments to the
[:c:func:`PyDate\_FromTimestamp`](#id137) function were incorrectly interpreted as a
single timestamp rather than an arguments tuple, which causes existing code
to start raising [:exc:`TypeError`](#id139). The backwards-incompatible change was
only present in alpha releases of Python 3.8. Patch by Paul Ganssle.

Modify `PyObject_Init` to correctly increase the refcount of heap-
allocated Type objects. Also fix the refcounts of the heap-allocated types
that were either doing this manually or not decreasing the type's refcount
in tp\_dealloc

Stop rejecting IPv4 octets with leading zeroes as ambiguously octal.

Plenty of other tools generate decimal IPv4 octets with leading zeroes,
so keeping this check hurts interoperability.

Patch by Joel Croteau.

|  |  | ================================ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Starting with Python 3.8.12 the :mod:`ipaddress` module no longer accepts |
|  |  | any leading zeros in IPv4 address strings. Leading zeros are ambiguous and |
|  |  | interpreted as octal notation by some libraries. For example the legacy |
|  |  | function :func:`socket.inet\_aton` treats leading zeros as octal notation. |
|  |  | glibc implementation of modern :func:`~socket.inet\_pton` does not accept |
|  |  | any leading zeros. |

### Title

python stdlib “ipaddress” – Improper Input Validation of octal literals in python 3.8.0 thru v3.10 results in indeterminate SSRF & RFI vulnerabilities. — “ipaddress leading zeros in IPv4 address”

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-29921

### CVSS Score

9.8

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### Internal ID

SICK-2021-014

### Vendor

python

### Product

ipaddress stdlib

### Product Versions

3.8.0 thru v3.10

### Vulnerability Details

Improper input validation of octal strings in Python 3.8.0 thru v3.10 stdlib ipaddress allows unauthenticated remote attackers to perform indeterminate SSRF, RFI, and LFI attacks on many programs that rely on Python stdlib ipaddress. IP address octects are left stripped instead of evaluated as valid IP addresses. For example, an attacker submitting an IP address to a web application that relies on stdlib ipaddress, could cause SSRF via inputting octal input data; An attacker can submit exploitable IP addresses if the octet is 3 digits, with the minimum exploitable octect being 08 (Denial of Service) and the maximum exploitable octet is 099. For example, an attacker can submit 010.8.8.8, which is 8.8.8.8, yet Python ipaddress builtin will evaluate this as 10.8.8.8.

### Vendor Response

Currently unpatched – due to be addressed in next release.

### Proof of Concept

Vulnerability added in python3.8

<https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/12577>

Documentated to be vulnerable in the changelog:

<https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/63298930fb531ba2bb4f23bc3b915dbf1e17e9e1/Misc/NEWS.d/3.8.0a4.rst>

*Stop rejecting IPv4 octets for being ambiguously octal. Leading zeros are ignored, and no longer are assumed to specify octal octets. Octets are always decimal numbers. Octets must still be no more than three digits, including leading zeroes.*

   Hi there !

   I may be at sea, but I wanted to know ; what’s the problem with this “vulnerability” ? What does it allow to do, knowing that ‘ipaddress’ just strips leading zeros in IP’s bytes while the ‘ping’ command seems to handle the leading zero in “010” as the octal value 8 ? I can’t understand why it is considered as a vulnerability…

       I’m still a little confused by the timeline. It currently reads:

       2019-03-20 – Issue created in <https://bugs.python.org/issue36384>

       2021-03-29 – Researchers discover vulnerability

       2021-03-29 – Vendor notified

       2021-03-29 – CVE requested

       2021-04-30 – CVE Assigned CVE-2021-29921 <https://bugs.python.org/issue36384#msg392423>

       I think it should read:

       2019-03-20 – Researchers discover vulnerability

       2021-03-20 – Issue created in <https://bugs.python.org/issue36384>

       2021-03-20 – Vendor notified

       2021-03-29 – CVE requested

       2021-03-30 – Fix merged in to main code branch

       2021-04-30 – CVE Assigned CVE-2021-29921 <https://bugs.python.org/issue36384#msg392423>

       I would argue that if a vendor has a bug report on a publicly available bug tracking system, then the vendor has been notified. In fact, looking at bug 392423, I see that Joel Croteau started working on the problem March 20th. I see that Nick Coghlan merged the fix into python 3.8.

       The reason why I am being pedantic about this is because I want an organization that is open and honest to be lauded when they respond to an obscure problem quickly.

         Hey Jeff,

         Thanks for reaching out, we didn’t originally know that Joel has created an issue 2 years prior, on 2019-03-20.

         `2021-03-20 – Issue created in https://bugs.python.org/issue36384`

         It’s confusing as it was exactly 2 years between initial issue and fix.

         What ended up happening was Joel created the issue in March 2019, then a half fix was applied here Aug 30, 2019, <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/63298930fb531ba2bb4f23bc3b915dbf1e17e9e1/Misc/NEWS.d/3.8.0a4.rst>

         *Stop rejecting IPv4 octets for being ambiguously octal. Leading zeros are ignored, and no longer are assumed to specify octal octets. Octets are always decimal numbers. Octets must still be no more than three digits, including leading zeroes.*

         However it was still vulnerable as indicated by the changelog.

         Then there was this message: <https://bugs.python.org/issue36384#msg389826>

         Which refers directly to our other CVE-2021-28918: <https://github.com/sickcodes/security/blob/master/advisories/SICK-2021-011.md>

         Which goes into detail here: <https://sick.codes/universal-netmask-npm-package-used-by-270000-projects-vulnerable-to-octal-input-data-server-side-request-forgery-remote-file-inclusion-local-file-inclusion-and-more-cve-2021-28918/>

         We submitted all of them on pretty much the same day, and then a week or so ago the CVE was assigned.

         I’d say it took a while, 2 years to fix, which is where the “discovered vulnerability” part comes into play.

         vstinner was right though, within 1 day of publishing this (as soon as we saw he had posted the CVE publicly) there was a fix available.

         Let me know if I’m missing something, but yeah there’s a 2 year gap between issue opening and the actual fix, jumpstarted by CVE-2021-28918 and then this received CVE-2021-29921.

         We submitted both xD

Reverts commit [e653d4d](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/e653d4d8e820a7a004ad399530af0135b45db27a) and makes
parsing even more strict. Like socket.inet_pton() any leading zero
is now treated as invalid input.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 342 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2788740.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.
