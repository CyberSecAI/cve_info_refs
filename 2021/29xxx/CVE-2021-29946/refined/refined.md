Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29946:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper range checking on port numbers parsed from the `Alt-Svc` header. Specifically, the code parses the port as an `int32_t` but does not verify if it falls within the valid range of a 16-bit integer, which is the intended range for port numbers. This oversight allows port numbers exceeding the 16-bit limit (65535) to be processed, effectively bypassing port blocking restrictions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The primary weakness is the handling of port numbers that are larger than what a 16 bit integer can represent.
- **Bypass of port blocking:** Due to the missing range check, an attacker can specify ports that would normally be blocked via the `Alt-Svc` header.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially bypass port blocking restrictions. Although rated as low severity, the secondary effects can be significant in busy networks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by an `Alt-Svc` header containing a port number that exceeds the valid 16-bit range.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to control or manipulate the `Alt-Svc` header provided by a server.
- The attacker has to send the `Alt-Svc` header to the vulnerable client.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced by a regression from a previous fix for port blocking.
- The fix involves range checking of the parsed port number to ensure it does not exceed the 16 bit limit within the `NS_CheckPortSafety` function.
- This vulnerability is rated as sec-low, but the potential impact can be higher in busy enterprise networks.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 88 and ESR 78.10.
