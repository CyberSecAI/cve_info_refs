# Padding Oracle Attack due to Observable Timing Discrepancy in jose-node-cjs-runtime

Moderate

[panva](/panva)
published
GHSA-rvcw-f68w-8h8h
Apr 15, 2021

## Package

npm

jose-node-cjs-runtime
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<3.11.4

## Patched versions

>=3.11.4

## Description

### Impact

[AES\_CBC\_HMAC\_SHA2 Algorithm](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-5.2) (A128CBC-HS256, A192CBC-HS384, A256CBC-HS512) decryption would always execute both HMAC tag verification and CBC decryption, if either failed `JWEDecryptionFailed` would be thrown. But a possibly observable difference in timing when padding error would occur while decrypting the ciphertext makes a padding oracle and an adversary might be able to make use of that oracle to decrypt data without knowing the decryption key by issuing on average 128\*b calls to the padding oracle (where b is the number of bytes in the ciphertext block).

### Patches

A patch was released which ensures the HMAC tag is verified before performing CBC decryption. The fixed versions are `>=3.11.4`.

Users should upgrade to `^3.11.4`.

### Credits

Thanks to Morgan Brown of Microsoft for bringing this up and Eva Sarafianou ([@esarafianou](https://github.com/esarafianou)) for helping to score this advisory.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
