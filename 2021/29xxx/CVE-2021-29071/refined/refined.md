The provided content is related to a security advisory for a post-authentication command injection vulnerability, but it's **not related to CVE-2021-29071**. The advisory is for **PSV-2020-0476** and specifically addresses a vulnerability in certain NETGEAR WiFi systems, not related to the CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability**: Post-authentication command injection. The advisory does not specify the exact mechanism of injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection.

**Impact of exploitation**:  The CVSS score is 9.6 (Critical), indicating a high impact in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability. It can be inferred from this score that a successful exploit would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device, potentially leading to data breaches, modification of settings, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors**: Adjacent network (AV:A). This indicates that the attacker needs to be within the same network segment as the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device.
    - The attacker needs to be authenticated to the device's management interface. This implies that the attacker needs valid credentials.
