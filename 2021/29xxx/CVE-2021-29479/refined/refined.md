Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29479:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Ratpack, prior to version 1.9.0, infers the public address of the server when handling redirects. It uses an inferring version of `PublicAddress` that is susceptible to manipulation via the `X-Forwarded-Host` header. If a cache in front of the Ratpack server doesn't include the `X-Forwarded-Host` header in its cache key, an attacker can poison the cache.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unkeyed Input:** The `X-Forwarded-Host` header is not included in the default cache key.
- **Insecure Default Configuration:** Ratpack's default `PublicAddress` implementation before v1.9.0 infers the public address from the request context, making it vulnerable.
- **Relative Redirects:** Before v1.9.0, relative redirects issued by the application were absolutized based on the inferred public address.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cache Poisoning:** An attacker can manipulate the `X-Forwarded-Host` header to cause the cache to store a response that redirects users to an attacker-controlled site.
- **Redirect Cache Poisoning:** Specifically, this can result in redirect cache poisoning, where cached redirects point to malicious sites rather than the intended location.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Header Manipulation:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request with a malicious `X-Forwarded-Host` header.
- **Network:** The attack can be carried out remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **No Special Privileges:** The attack does not require any prior user authentication or privileges.
- **Knowledge of Cache Configuration:** The attacker needs to know that the cache does not use the `X-Forwarded-Host` header as part of its cache key.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is mitigated in Ratpack version 1.9.0 by:
   - The default `PublicAddress` implementation no longer infers the address from the request context.
   - Relative redirects are no longer absolutized.
- The vulnerability is classified as **High** severity with a CVSS v3 score of 7.0.
- The vulnerability is related to the CWE-807 "Reliance on untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision".
- The provided portswigger.net content provides a detailed explanation of web cache poisoning techniques and concepts, including the identification of unkeyed inputs, but does not directly relate to this specific CVE. However, it establishes the basis for understanding the underlying principles of the vulnerability.
