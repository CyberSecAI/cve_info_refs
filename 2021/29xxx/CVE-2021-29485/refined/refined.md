- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure deserialization of untrusted data within the Ratpack session mechanism, specifically when storing serialized objects.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Insecure deserialization: The application deserializes arbitrary types without proper validation, allowing an attacker to inject malicious payloads.
    - Lack of allow-list: Older versions of Ratpack didn't use a strict allow-list for deserialization, making it vulnerable to gadget chain attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Server-side storage: Attackers can write to the session data store if they obtain the ability to do so.
    - Client-side storage: Attackers can manipulate session cookies if they obtain the secrets used to encrypt/sign them.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to write to session data storage (if using server-side storage).
    - Ability to obtain the secrets used to encrypt or sign session data (if using client-side storage).
