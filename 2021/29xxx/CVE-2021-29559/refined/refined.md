The provided content relates to CVE-2021-29559.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the assumption that the `input_value`/`input_splits` pair in `tf.raw_ops.UnicodeEncode` always represents a valid sparse tensor. This assumption is incorrect, and when provided with specifically crafted inputs, it leads to out-of-bounds access of heap-allocated memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap out-of-bounds read.
- Improper validation of input data in `tf.raw_ops.UnicodeEncode`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can potentially read data outside the bounds of a heap-allocated array. This could lead to information disclosure or potentially other more severe consequences, depending on the specific memory layout and the data read.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted `input_splits` tensor to `tf.raw_ops.UnicodeEncode`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to control the inputs of `tf.raw_ops.UnicodeEncode` to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `tensorflow/core/kernels/unicode_ops.cc`.
- The fix is included in commit `51300ba1cc2f487aefec6e6631fef03b0e08b298`.
- The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0, with patches backported to 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity.
- The vulnerability was reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.
- The provided example demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability with specifically crafted `input_values` and `input_splits`.
