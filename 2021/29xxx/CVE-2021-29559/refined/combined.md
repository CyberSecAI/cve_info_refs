# Heap OOB access in unicode ops

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-59q2-x2qc-4c97
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can access data outside of bounds of heap allocated array in `tf.raw_ops.UnicodeEncode`:

```
import tensorflow as tf

input_values = tf.constant([58], shape=[1], dtype=tf.int32)
input_splits = tf.constant([[81, 101, 0]], shape=[3], dtype=tf.int32)
output_encoding = "UTF-8"

tf.raw_ops.UnicodeEncode(
    input_values=input_values, input_splits=input_splits,
    output_encoding=output_encoding)
```

This is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/472c1f12ad9063405737679d4f6bd43094e1d36d/tensorflow/core/kernels/unicode_ops.cc)

assumes that the `input_value`/`input_splits` pair specify a valid sparse tensor.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [51300ba1cc2f487aefec6e6631fef03b0e08b298](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/51300ba1cc2f487aefec6e6631fef03b0e08b298).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-29559

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
