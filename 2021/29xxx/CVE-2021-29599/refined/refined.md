The provided content relates to CVE-2021-29599.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a division by zero error in the TFLite's implementation of the `Split` operator. Specifically, the code calculates `slice_size` by dividing `input_size` by `num_splits`. If an attacker crafts a model where `num_splits` is 0, it leads to a division by zero.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Division by zero vulnerability in the `Split` TFLite operator.
- Lack of proper input validation for `num_splits` which allows it to be zero.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The division by zero error will cause a crash when processing the crafted model due to the undefined behavior resulting from division by zero. This can lead to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious TensorFlow Lite model with a `Split` operator where `num_splits` is set to 0.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted TensorFlow Lite model to be processed by a vulnerable system.
