The provided content is related to CVE-2021-29329.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack overflow in the `fxBinaryExpressionNodeDistribute` function within the Moddable XS JavaScript engine. This is triggered by a crafted JavaScript payload that involves excessive string manipulation and object assignments.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow vulnerability.
- Improper handling of deeply nested expressions and string operations in the JavaScript engine.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash/Denial of Service: The stack overflow causes the program to crash due to memory corruption.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: Although the provided information does not explicitly mention it, a stack overflow could potentially be leveraged for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted JavaScript payload: The attacker provides a malicious JavaScript code snippet that exploits the vulnerability. The code constructs a long string and uses eval() to trigger the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute JavaScript code within a Moddable XS environment.
- No special privileges or positions are explicitly required, beyond the ability to supply input to the vulnerable system.
