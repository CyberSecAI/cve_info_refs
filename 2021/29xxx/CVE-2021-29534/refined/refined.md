Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29534:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing overflow check in the `TensorShape` constructor when processing the `shapes` input of the `tf.raw_ops.SparseConcat` operation in TensorFlow.  The `TensorShape` constructor directly uses the values specified in `shapes[0]` as dimensions for the output shape. When it adds a dimension from the argument that causes an overflow during the calculation of total number of elements the constructor's internal `CHECK` operation triggers which leads to a crash due to a `CHECK`-fail.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing overflow check:** The `TensorShape` constructor doesn't properly handle potential integer overflows when calculating the number of elements based on the provided shape dimensions.
- **Use of `CHECK`:** The use of `CHECK` in the `TensorShape` constructor leads to a program termination when the overflow is detected instead of a recoverable error.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of service:** An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing crafted input shapes to the `tf.raw_ops.SparseConcat` operation that result in an integer overflow when creating the output `TensorShape`. This will trigger a `CHECK`-fail, crashing the TensorFlow process.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the `tf.raw_ops.SparseConcat` operation.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing carefully crafted input to the shapes argument when invoking `tf.raw_ops.SparseConcat` with the python API.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to control the input shapes passed to the `tf.raw_ops.SparseConcat` operation. This would require the attacker to have some control or influence over the code that uses this operation.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided GitHub content includes the specific code change (commit `69c68ecbb24dff3fa0e46da0d16c821a2dd22d7c`) that fixes the issue by adding overflow checks and utilizing the safer `MultiplyWithoutOverflow` API in the `AddManySparseToTensorsMapOp` implementation.
- The fix involves adding an overflow check before creating the output shape, preventing a crash.
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0.
- Patches were backported to versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
- The provided example code demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability.
- This is classified as low severity, likely because it is a denial of service and not a data breach or privilege escalation vulnerability.
