Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29536:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a heap buffer overflow in the `QuantizedReshape` operation within TensorFlow. The implementation incorrectly assumes that the input tensors representing the minimum and maximum quantization thresholds are always valid scalars (single values) or vectors with a single element. If these tensors are empty, the code attempts to access an element at index 0 of an empty buffer, leading to a heap buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow, which occurs when the code accesses memory outside the allocated bounds of the buffer.
*   **Missing Input Validation:** The code lacks proper validation of the input tensors representing the minimum and maximum values for quantization. It doesn't check if the input tensors are empty before attempting to read values, which leads to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger the heap buffer overflow, which could lead to a crash of the TensorFlow application, causing a denial of service.
*   **Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE):** While not explicitly stated, heap buffer overflows can sometimes be leveraged for more severe exploits, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, depending on the program's memory layout and the attacker's skill.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Input Tensors:** An attacker can craft specific input tensors, specifically empty tensors for `input_min` and `input_max` within `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedReshape`, to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Input to TensorFlow:** An attacker needs the ability to provide input tensors to a TensorFlow model that uses the vulnerable `QuantizedReshape` operation. This could involve providing malicious inputs to a deployed model.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0.
*   Patches have been made and included in versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2 to address this issue. The fix implemented checks if the shape of the input tensors for `input_min` and `input_max` are scalars or vectors with a single element to prevent accessing out of bound memory.
*   The commit `a324ac84e573fba362a5e53d4e74d5de6729933e` on GitHub contains the fix for this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is classified as having "Low" severity.
