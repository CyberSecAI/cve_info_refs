The provided content relates to CVE-2021-29615.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a stack overflow in the `ParseAttrValue` function due to excessive recursion when processing nested tensors.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `ParseAttrValue` function lacks proper checks on the depth of nested tensors.
- Recursive calls without a depth limit can lead to a stack overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A stack overflow can lead to a denial of service (DoS).
- Potentially, it could also lead to other security issues such as arbitrary code execution, but this is not mentioned in the content.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attackers can craft a malicious input with deeply nested tensors.
- The input is processed by `ParseAttrValue` function, which triggers the stack overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide or influence the input processed by the vulnerable `ParseAttrValue` function.
- No specific privileges or positions are mentioned.

**Additional notes:**
- The fix implemented in commit `e07e1c3d26492c06f078c7e5bf2d138043e199c1` introduces a check on the nesting depth of tensors to prevent the stack overflow.
- The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0, and was backported to versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
- The severity of the vulnerability is considered low.
