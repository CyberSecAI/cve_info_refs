Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackprop*` operations in TensorFlow did not validate that input tensors are non-empty. Specifically, the code calculates a `shard_size` which involves division by `work_unit_size`, which can be zero, leading to a division-by-zero error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of input validation: The code doesn't check for empty input tensors before performing calculations that can lead to division by zero.
- Division-by-zero vulnerability:  The `work_unit_size` can be calculated as zero, leading to a division-by-zero error when calculating the shard size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause a division-by-zero error, crashing the TensorFlow process, thus leading to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  By crafting specific input tensors for `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackpropInputV2` and `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackpropFilterV2` operations that result in a zero `work_unit_size`. The attacker manipulates the input tensor sizes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to control the input tensors' shape and values provided to the vulnerable TensorFlow operations.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects `Conv3DBackpropInputV2` and `Conv3DBackpropFilterV2` operations in TensorFlow.
- The provided code snippet shows example usage of how an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
- The fix adds a check to ensure that the `work_unit_size` is greater than zero before division, preventing the division-by-zero error.
- The vulnerability is considered low severity.
- Patched versions are 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2. The fix is also included in 2.5.0.
- The commit `311403edbc9816df80274bd1ea8b3c0c0f22c3fa` contains the fix.
