Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2021-29428:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a race condition in how Gradle creates temporary directories on Unix-like systems. These directories are used for compiling precompiled script plugins, for `ProjectBuilder` API in tests, and by `TestKit` in tests.
*   Gradle uses the system's temporary directory (e.g., `/tmp`) which, if not configured with a sticky bit, allows any user to create and delete files/directories within it.
*   The insecure creation pattern involves creating a temp file, deleting it and then creating the directory at the same location which can be exploited by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:**  When creating temporary directories in the system temporary directory, Gradle does not use an atomic method to create a directory. It uses `File.createTempFile` to create a temporary file, then immediately deletes this file, and then uses `mkdir` to create the directory. An attacker can exploit the time between the deletion of the temp file and the creation of the directory to create a symlink or a directory with controlled content which can lead to privilege escalation.
*   **Insecure Permissions:** On Unix-like systems, if the system's temporary directory (`/tmp`) does not have the sticky bit set, multiple users can create and delete files/directories within it.
*   **Reliance on System Temporary Directory:** Gradle's use of the system temporary directory without proper permission management opens the door for attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** An attacker, by exploiting the race condition, can gain the same privileges as the user running the Gradle build.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** By writing malicious files into the temporary directory, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary commands with the permissions of the Gradle build process. This could allow for arbitrary code execution and complete compromise of the build environment.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is local: An attacker must have local access to a system where a vulnerable version of Gradle is used.
*   The attacker must have the ability to write files in the system's temporary directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable Gradle build is being executed.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker does not need special privileges initially, a user with low privileges is enough.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to be able to quickly create files/directories and potentially overwrite or manipulate the temporary directory created by Gradle during the race window.

**Affected Scenarios:**

*   **Precompiled Kotlin DSL Script Plugins:** Builds that use precompiled Kotlin DSL script plugins are vulnerable because Gradle uses the system temporary directory for intermediate build steps.
*   **`ProjectBuilder` API:** Unit tests using the `ProjectBuilder` API that do not specify a custom project directory, will be vulnerable because Gradle creates the project directory in the system's temporary directory.
*  **`TestKit` API:** Integration tests using `TestKit` are vulnerable because `TestKit` uses the system's temp directory to cache Gradle distributions and dependencies.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Upgrade Gradle:** Upgrade to Gradle version 7.0 or later, which avoids using the system temporary directory in vulnerable ways by using the Gradle User Home and project's build directory instead.
*   **"Sticky" Bit:** On Unix-like systems, ensure the system's temporary directory has the "sticky" bit set (e.g., `chmod +t /tmp`). This prevents users from deleting files they don't own in the directory.
*  **`java.io.tmpdir`:** Set the `java.io.tmpdir` system property to a directory with restricted permissions, accessible only by the build user.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information from GitHub pull requests highlights the work done to refactor how Gradle handles temporary files and directories, aiming to mitigate this vulnerability and others by using a unified, secure API.
*   The vulnerability is specific to Unix-like systems, Windows and modern macOS versions are not affected.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "High" severity, with a CVSS v3 base score of 8.8/10.

In summary, CVE-2021-29428 describes a local privilege escalation vulnerability in Gradle versions prior to 7.0. This vulnerability arises due to a race condition and insecure use of the system temporary directory during Gradle build processes. An attacker with local access to the system can exploit this vulnerability to gain the same privileges as the Gradle build process, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the system.
