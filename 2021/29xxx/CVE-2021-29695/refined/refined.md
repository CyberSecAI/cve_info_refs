  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The document does not provide the root cause of the vulnerability. It only indicates that vulnerabilities exist.",
    "weaknesses": "The document does not explicitly state specific weaknesses, but implies that the vulnerabilities are related to weak passwords, insecure network configurations, and improper session management.",
    "impact": "The impact of exploitation is not specifically described in this document, but it can be inferred to be unauthorized access and control of the affected systems.",
   "attack_vectors": "The document does not detail specific attack vectors but implies that exploitation could come from network access to the management interface of the BMC through methods like password guessing or session hijacking.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need network access to the BMC's management interface and the ability to exploit the vulnerabilities. Specific knowledge is not detailed."

      "Use an account with the minimum authority needed. Consider using an operator session for normal operations and an admin session only when making administrative changes to the BMC.",
      "Limit session durations and always log out of sessions when done. The default web session timeout is 10 minutes and can be changed.",
       "Place the BMC's management network behind a secure Linux box (jump box or bastion host) with strong security, multi-factor authentication, and logging and monitoring."
