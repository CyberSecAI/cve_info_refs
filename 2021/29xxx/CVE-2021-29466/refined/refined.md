- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Path traversal vulnerability in the `.recon` command within the Discord-Recon application. The application did not properly sanitize user-provided input for file paths.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal (CWE-25) vulnerability. The application allows the user to control the path provided to access files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can read local files from the server, potentially disclosing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious input string containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `..`) as part of the file path argument for the `.recon` command. This allows the attacker to access files outside the intended directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send commands to the Discord-Recon application and influence the file path argument.
