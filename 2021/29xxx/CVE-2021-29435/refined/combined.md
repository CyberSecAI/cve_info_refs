# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in trestle-auth

Moderate

[spohlenz](/spohlenz)
published
GHSA-h8hx-2c5r-32cf
Apr 12, 2021

## Package

bundler

trestle-auth
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

0.4.0, 0.4.1

## Patched versions

0.4.2

## Description

### Impact

A vulnerability in trestle-auth versions 0.4.0 and 0.4.1 allows an attacker to create a form that will bypass Rails' built-in CSRF protection when submitted by a victim with a trestle-auth admin session. This potentially allows an attacker to alter protected data, including admin account credentials.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been fixed in trestle-auth 0.4.2 released to RubyGems.
