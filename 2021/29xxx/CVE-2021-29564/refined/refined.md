Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29564:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by incomplete validation of input parameters in the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.EditDistance`. Specifically, when the output shape of the tensor has 0 elements, the `output->flat<T>()` method returns an empty buffer and calling `setZero` on this results in a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core vulnerability is a null pointer dereference which occurs because of lack of proper input validation and handling of empty tensors during output allocation.
- **Incomplete Input Validation:** The vulnerability highlights insufficient input validation within the `EditDistance` operation, leading to the possibility of creating a zero-sized output shape and subsequent null pointer dereference.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a program crash due to the null pointer dereference, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted Input:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specific crafted input to the `tf.raw_ops.EditDistance` function such that the calculated output shape results in a zero-element tensor.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to control the input parameters to `tf.raw_ops.EditDistance`. This could be achieved through manipulation of data fed to a TensorFlow model.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in the `tensorflow/core/kernels/edit_distance_op.cc` file, specifically in the code handling output tensor allocation and initialization.
- The patch involves adding validation to ensure that the calculated output shape is not empty before proceeding with allocation and initialization.
- The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0, and is fixed in versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2 via cherry-picked commits.
