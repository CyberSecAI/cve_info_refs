The provided content contains a detailed report of a stack overflow vulnerability in the Moddable-OpenSource/moddable project, specifically within the xs engine.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by excessive recursion during the parsing of a crafted JavaScript string. The `fxExponentiationExpression` function is called recursively without limit, leading to stack exhaustion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow due to unbounded recursion.
- Improper handling of deeply nested expressions during parsing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service due to program crash (SIGSEGV).

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a specially crafted JavaScript string during parsing via the `eval` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to influence the input of the `eval` function in the Moddable XS engine. This could be through a web interface or by supplying the crafted code directly to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**

The provided proof-of-concept (POC) code demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability:

1.  `getHiddenValue()`: creates an object `obj` by executing a string. This string contains a large number of `'*'` characters that, when processed, will trigger the stack overflow later.
2.  `makeOobString()`: creates a class `x` extending `Array`, then assigns the object from `getHiddenValue()` to `fun` and executes `toString()`. This is where the stack overflow occurs.
3. The `ASAN` output details the call stack which indicates that the `fxExponentiationExpression` function in xsSyntaxical.c is called repeatedly during parsing, leading to a stack overflow.
