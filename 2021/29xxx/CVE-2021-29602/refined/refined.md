The provided content is related to CVE-2021-29602.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a division-by-zero error in the `DepthwiseConv` TFLite operator implementation. Specifically, the code calculates the `depth_multiplier` by dividing the number of filter channels by the number of input channels. If the number of input channels is zero, a division-by-zero error occurs, causing the application to crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Division by zero error: The code lacks proper validation to check if `num_input_channels` is zero before performing the division.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact of this vulnerability is a crash of the application that uses the vulnerable TFLite operator.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious TFLite model where the input tensor has a fourth dimension of size 0. When such a model is processed by the affected code, it will lead to the division-by-zero.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a TFLite model that is then processed by a vulnerable version of TensorFlow Lite. No specific position is required but needs to have control over the model being used.
