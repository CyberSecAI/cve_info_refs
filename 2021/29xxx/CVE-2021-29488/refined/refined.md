- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `filesystem.renamer()` function in SABnzbd could be tricked by malicious PAR2 files to write downloaded files outside the configured Download Folder.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in how the `filesystem.renamer()` function processes PAR2 files, allowing for path manipulation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can create files in locations outside the user-configured download folder, which could be used to run commands, manipulate the system (by adding files used by other programs), or deplete disk space on other partitions. The files can be created anywhere the SABnzbd process has write permissions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through malicious PAR2 files included in NZB downloads. An attacker must craft a malicious NZB that leads to the download of malicious PAR2 files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to create or post a malicious NZB file that includes malicious PAR2 files on Usenet. A user must be tricked into adding the malicious NZB to their SABnzbd download queue, either manually or automatically via third party application integration.
