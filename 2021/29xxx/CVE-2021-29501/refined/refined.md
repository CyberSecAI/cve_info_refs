Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29501:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the usage of `message.format(user=ctx.author)` in the Ticketer cog for the Red DiscordBot. This allows a Discord user to inject arbitrary Python code through the `message` configuration. The `format` function, when given a dictionary or object, accesses its attributes and can execute code if the provided object has special attributes such as `__class__`, `__bases__`, or `__subclasses__`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Format String:** The primary vulnerability is the use of an uncontrolled format string, where user-provided input (the ticket message) is directly used in the `format()` function, making it vulnerable to code injection.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** There is a failure to sanitize or validate the user-supplied message before using it in the format string.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can inject arbitrary Python code through a specially crafted message, leading to RCE on the bot's host.
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** An attacker could potentially access and expose sensitive data stored on the bot or connected systems.
*   **Bot Takeover:** The attacker could gain control of the bot and perform malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `message` configuration of the Ticketer cog.
*   A Discord user who is able to configure the bot can set the message to a malicious string that when formatted, will execute arbitrary code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have the necessary permissions to configure the bot, specifically the ability to modify the message setting of the Ticketer cog.

**Additional details:**

*   The fix involves replacing the vulnerable `ctx.author` with a `SafeMember` class, which does not have the vulnerable attributes such as `__class__` that could be leveraged to execute code. This prevents the code injection.
*   The affected versions are any versions of the `Ticketer` cog prior to `1.0.1`. The patched version is `1.0.1` and later.
