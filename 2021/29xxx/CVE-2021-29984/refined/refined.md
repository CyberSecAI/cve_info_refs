Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29984:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Incorrect instruction reordering during JIT (Just-In-Time) optimization. Specifically, a `Concat` instruction was moved between a `StoreElement` and `SetInitializedLength` instruction during the optimization process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect Garbage Collection:** Due to the reordering, if the `Concat` operation triggered garbage collection, the element being stored would not be marked as live by the garbage collector, leading to a use-after-free scenario if the garbage collector reclaims the memory.
- **Memory Corruption:** The use-after-free condition causes memory corruption when the program attempts to access the freed memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Exploitable crash:** Memory corruption leads to a potentially exploitable crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered through JavaScript code executed within the browser or a similar context (like Thunderbird when not used as an email reader), utilizing the JIT compiler.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within the context of the affected application. This could be through a malicious website or a crafted HTML document loaded within Thunderbird.
- They would need to craft a specific sequence of JavaScript operations that would trigger the faulty instruction reordering and subsequent garbage collection. This requires a good understanding of the JIT compiler.

**Additional Details from Bugzilla:**
- The bug was initially found due to an assertion failure in debug builds, which was a result of an object unexpectedly being outside the nursery.
- The simplified test case provided in comment 6 shows the issue:
```javascript
function main() {
  let a = "0";
  let b = "0";
  for (let i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
    if (b) {
      a = "0";
    }
    Reflect.apply(String.fromCharCode, String, ["0", b]);
    b = b + a;
  }
}
main();
```
- The fix was to prevent the reordering of instructions before `SetInitializedLength`.
- A new JitOption was added to help with fuzzing.
- The fix was backported to ESR78 and Beta, in addition to being fixed in the main release branches.
