Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29011:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in multiple fields within the Radius Manager software web interface. Specifically, several input fields fail to properly encode or escape special characters like `<` and `>` which allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. Malicious JavaScript can be injected into various input fields, and when a user views the page containing these fields, the script will execute. These fields include:
    *   Description field when creating new service plans.
    *   Address field when creating or editing a user account.
    *   Description field when editing or adding access points.
    *   First name, last name, or address field when creating or editing a manager account.
    *   Name or description field when creating or editing a NAS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can use XSS to steal session cookies from authenticated users, including administrative accounts.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By using a stolen session cookie, an attacker can make requests on behalf of the victim user, potentially gaining administrative privileges and performing actions they shouldn't be authorized to do.
*   **Account Impersonation:** With a stolen session cookie, an attacker can impersonate a user as long as the victim is currently logged in, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information or functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface Input:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code through vulnerable input fields in the Radius Manager web interface.
*   **HTTP Requests:**  The provided example HTTP requests demonstrate how XSS can be injected through fields like `firstname`, `lastname`, `address`, `description`, `name`, `descr` in POST requests targeting different endpoints.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Radius Manager Web Interface:** The attacker must have access to the Radius Manager software's web interface.
*   **Sufficient Privileges:**  The attacker needs an account with enough privileges to add or edit items where vulnerable fields exist such as creating a new user, access point, service plan, etc.
*   **Social Engineering (Potentially):** To fully exploit the vulnerability for session hijacking and privilege escalation, the attacker needs to trick an administrator into viewing a page with the injected JavaScript.
*   **Network Sniffing or Interception:** To take advantage of the session cookie, the attacker would use tools like Firefox's network monitor or an HTTP proxy to intercept requests.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability can be chained with CVE-2021-29012 (broken session management) to elevate privileges, an attacker can inject malicious code through XSS, steal admin session cookies, and then use the broken session management to impersonate the admin and perform actions that would otherwise be restricted.
*   The stolen session cookie does not expire upon logout, making session hijacking easier. However, the admin needs to be logged in at the time of the attack to get a valid session cookie.
*   The description field for the access points can fit the full script needed to steal session cookies and transmit them to the attacker's controlled server.
