Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A vulnerability exists in the sed command, allowing a user to escape a restricted shell environment.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper restrictions within the sed command when used in a restricted shell environment. This allows for command injection that enables users to break out of the intended shell.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An authenticated attacker can escape the restricted shell.
- The attacker can gain access to sensitive information.
- The attacker can cause a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by an authenticated user who has access to the restricted shell and uses the sed command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the affected system.
- The attacker requires access to the system's restricted shell.
