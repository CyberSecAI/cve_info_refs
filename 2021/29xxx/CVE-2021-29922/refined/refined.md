  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the `Ipv4Addr` parser in the Rust standard library not properly handling leading zeros in IPv4 address strings, which are interpreted as octal literals instead of decimal, leading to incorrect IP address parsing.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation of IPv4 address strings.",
        "Incorrect interpretation of leading zeros as octal literals."
      ],
      "impact": "Attackers could bypass access control mechanisms that rely on IP address checks by providing crafted IP address strings with leading zeros that resolve to different addresses than intended. This could lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Remote File Inclusion (RFI), and Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities.",
      "attack_vectors": "Network-based attacks by providing crafted IPv4 address strings with leading zeros to applications using the vulnerable `Ipv4Addr` parser.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to submit crafted input to a system using the vulnerable code and  no special privileges are required for this exploitation.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability affects rust versions prior to 1.53.0.  The vulnerability is present because the `Ipv4Addr` parser does not reject octal format IP addresses in addition to rejecting hexadecimal IP addresses as specified by IETF RFC 6943. The advisory also notes that exploitable octets are 3 digits with the minimum exploitable octet being 08, and the maximum exploitable octet being 099. It also clarifies that inputting an IP like 127.0.026.1 which is 127.0.22.1 will be evaluated as 127.0.26.1. Additionally the content provides proof of concept code for reproducing the vulnerability."
