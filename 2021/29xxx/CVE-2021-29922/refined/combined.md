# Ipv4Addr: Incorrect Parsing for Octal format IP string ¬†#83648

## Description

![@xu-cheng](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3105373?u=20b9c3f0084ae894679e86b2f8313983bcf4f01c&v=4&size=48)[xu-cheng](https://github.com/xu-cheng)opened [on Mar 29, 2021](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83648#issue-843527472)

This issue is inspired by [this blog](https://sick.codes/universal-netmask-npm-package-used-by-270000-projects-vulnerable-to-octal-input-data-server-side-request-forgery-remote-file-inclusion-local-file-inclusion-and-more-cve-2021-28918/).

Due to the specification, leading zero in IP string is interpreted as octal literals. So a IP address `0127.0.0.1` actually means `87.0.0.1`. As shown in the following example:

```
‚ùØ ping 0127.0.0.1
PING 0127.0.0.1 (87.0.0.1): 56 data bytes

```

However, the `Ipv4Addr` from the std library will recognize it as `127.0.0.1` instead. A simple code to demo the situation ([playground link](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=a8982ed52005c4560bc695ab0fb1daed)):

```
use std::net::Ipv4Addr;

fn parse(input: &str) {
    let ip: Option<Ipv4Addr> = input.parse().ok();
    println!("{} -> {:?}", input, ip);

}

fn main() {
    parse("127.0.0.1");
    parse("0127.0.0.1");
}
```

I expected to see this happen:

```
127.0.0.1 -> Some(127.0.0.1)
0127.0.0.1 -> Some(87.0.0.1)

```

Instead, this happened:

```
127.0.0.1 -> Some(127.0.0.1)
0127.0.0.1 -> Some(127.0.0.1)

```

Noted this bug may cause security vulnerabilities in certain cases. For example, a Rust program uses `Ipv4Addr` doing some sanity check then passing the user string to other library or program.

Furthermore, the specification actually also allows hex format in IP string.

## Description

library/std/src/net/parser.rs in Rust before 1.53.0 does not properly consider extraneous zero characters at the beginning of an IP address string, which (in some situations) allows attackers to bypass access control that is based on IP addresses, because of unexpected octal interpretation.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A ‚ÄúPersonal Account‚Äù represents an individual User‚Äôs authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User‚Äôs identity on GitHub. ‚ÄúOrganizations‚Äù are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The ‚ÄúAgreement‚Äù refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the ‚ÄúTerms of Service‚Äù or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. ‚ÄúContent‚Äù refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. ‚ÄúUser-Generated Content‚Äù is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. ‚ÄúGitHub,‚Äù ‚ÄúWe,‚Äù and ‚ÄúUs‚Äù refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The ‚ÄúService‚Äù refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. ‚ÄúThe User,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou,‚Äù and ‚ÄúYour‚Äù refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The ‚ÄúWebsite‚Äù refers to GitHub‚Äôs website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub‚Äôs conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization‚Äôs data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User‚Äôs Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country‚Äôs minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country‚Äôs laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person ‚Äî i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us ‚Äî and other GitHub Users ‚Äî certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 ‚Äî D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 ‚Äî D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement‚Äîfor security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories.

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn‚Äôt available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it‚Äôs important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub‚Äôs confidential information (collectively, ‚ÄúConfidential Information‚Äù), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the ‚ÄúPurpose‚Äù), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don‚Äôt otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That‚Äôs why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don‚Äôt and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world‚Äôs most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot‚Äôs best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ‚Äúcopy/paste‚Äù?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot‚Äôs suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not ‚Äúcopying and pasting‚Äù from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor‚Äîfocusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also¬† adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot¬† throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization‚Äôs codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer‚Äôs knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub‚Äôs model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub‚Äôs Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub‚Äôs retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features‚Äô effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot‚Äôs suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here‚Äôs some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:¬† Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot‚Äôs AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub‚Äôs public repositories‚Äîwhich are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub‚Äôs research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub‚Äôs AI model. Again, Copilot does not ‚Äúlook up‚Äù or ‚Äúcopy and paste‚Äù code, but is instead using context from a user‚Äôs workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot‚Äôs model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there‚Äôs a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories‚Äîincluding ones without licenses‚Äîthat code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don‚Äôt determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‚Äòfunctional‚Äô instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we‚Äôve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It‚Äôs not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called ‚ÄúCopilot‚Äù not ‚ÄúAutopilot‚Äù and it‚Äôs not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot‚Äôs suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses ‚Äì rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. ‚Äì you should continue these policies with Copilot‚Äôs suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot‚Äôs suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You‚Äôre entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot‚Äôs filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot‚Äôs ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That‚Äôs why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don‚Äôt and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world‚Äôs most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot‚Äôs best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ‚Äúcopy/paste‚Äù?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot‚Äôs suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not ‚Äúcopying and pasting‚Äù from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor‚Äîfocusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub‚Äôs model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub‚Äôs Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub‚Äôs retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features‚Äô effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot‚Äôs suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here‚Äôs some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:¬† Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot‚Äôs AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub‚Äôs public repositories‚Äîwhich are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub‚Äôs research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub‚Äôs AI model. Again, Copilot does not ‚Äúlook up‚Äù or ‚Äúcopy and paste‚Äù code, but is instead using context from a user‚Äôs workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot‚Äôs model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there‚Äôs a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories‚Äîincluding ones without licenses‚Äîthat code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don‚Äôt determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‚Äòfunctional‚Äô instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we‚Äôve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It‚Äôs not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called ‚ÄúCopilot‚Äù not ‚ÄúAutopilot‚Äù and it‚Äôs not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot‚Äôs suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses ‚Äì rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. ‚Äì you should continue these policies with Copilot‚Äôs suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot‚Äôs suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You‚Äôre entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot‚Äôs filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot‚Äôs ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

### Title
CVE-2021-29922 rust standard library "net" - Improper Input Validation of octal literals in rust 1.52.0 std::net and below results in indeterminate SSRF & RFI vulnerabilities.
### CVE ID
CVE-2021-29922
### CVSS Score
9.1 CRITICAL
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
### Internal ID
SICK-2021-015
### Vendor
rust-lang
### Product
rust std::net
### Product Versions
1.52.1 and below
### Vulnerability Details
Improper input validation of octal strings in rust-lang standard library "net" allows unauthenticated remote attackers to perform indeterminate SSRF, RFI, and LFI attacks on many programs that rely on rust-lang std::net. IP address octects are left stripped instead of evaluated as valid IP addresses. For example, an attacker submitting an IP address to a web application that relies on std::net::IpAddr, could cause SSRF via inputting octal input data; An attacker can submit exploitable IP addresses if the octet is 3 digits, with the minimum exploitable octect being 08 (Denial of Service) and the maximum exploitable octet is 099 (Denial of Service). For example, an attacker can submit 010.8.8.8, which is 8.8.8.8 (RFI), yet std::net::IpAddr will evaluate this as 10.8.8.8. Equally, an attacker can input 127.0.026.1 which is really 127.0.22.1 but rust evaluates it as 127.0.26.1.
### Vendor Response
Fixed in rust 1.53: [https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83652](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83652)

### Breaking TrustZone-M: Privilege Escalation on LPC55S69

45 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Laura Abbott Oxide Computer Company

#### Rick Altherr Oxide Computer Company

Virtual only presentation

The concept of Trusted Execution Environments has been broadly introduced to microcontrollers with ARM‚Äôs TrustZone-M. While much experience with TrustZone-A can be applied, architectural differences with ARMv8-M lead to a very different approach to configuration and transitions between secure and non-secure worlds. This talk will deep dive into how TrustZone-M works, where to look for weaknesses in implementations, and a detailed look into NXP LPC55S69‚Äôs implementation including discovering an undocumented peripheral that leads to a priviledge escalation vulnerability exploitable with TrustedFirmware-M. Finally, NXP PSIRT will be used as a case study in how \_not\_ to respond to a vulnerability report.

### The Mechanics of Compromising Low Entropy RSA Keys

20 minutes

#### Austin Allshouse Staff Research Scientist / BitSight

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Over the past decade, there have been a number of research efforts
(and DEFCON talks!) investigating the phenomenon of RSA keys on the
Internet that share prime factors with other keys. This can occur
when devices have poorly initialized sources of ‚Äúrandomness‚Äù when
generating keys; making it trivial to factor the RSA modulus and
recover the private key because, unlike large integer factorization,
calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two moduli can be
fast and efficient. When describing their research, past hackers and
researchers have attested that they ‚Äúbuilt a custom distributed
implementation of Batch-GCD;‚Äù which seems like one hell of a detail to
gloss over, right? This talk will detail a hacker's journey from
understanding and implementing distributed batch GCD to analyzing
findings from compromising RSA keys from network devices en masse.

### 2021 - Our Journey Back To The Future Of Windows Vulnerabilities and the 0-days we brought back with us

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Tomer Bar Director of Security Research @ SafeBreach

#### Eran Segal Security Researcher @ SafeBreach Labs

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

In 2020, security researchers reported a record number of Windows vulnerabilities. We were curious what superpowers will we get from researching this huge number of vulnerabilities? Can we leverage our findings to discover 0-days?

We decided to go back in time to 2016 to search for patterns and automatically classify all the public vulnerabilities since then. We believed that only by connecting the dots to a bigger picture, we will be able to come back 2021 with the success of achieving our goal.

We adopted a new approach, in terms of both the goal and how to get there. Until now, the main goal of patch-diff was focused on the root cause of the vulnerability and building a 1-day to exploit it Usually patch-diff was done manually on a single patch.

We reached higher for the holy grail. We understood that in order to find 0-days we needed to build an automated process that would gather all the insights from all the patches in a single, searchable db.

It worked! We discovered the root causes of multiple classes of vulnerabilities. We used these discoveries on a fully patched Windows 10 host in order to highlight opportunities for exploitation. As a consequence, we found and reported (1) 6 information disclosure vulnerabilities to Microsoft, (2) 2 post exploitation techniques allowing covert exfiltration of private user data, and (3) an additional surprise.

In this presentation, we'll describe our research process, demonstrate a live exploitation of the vulnerabilities we found, share the tools we developed, and explain how other researchers can use it to discover 0-days.

### Abusing SAST tools! When scanners do more than just scanning

45 minutes | Demo

#### Rotem Bar Head of Marketplace Integrations @ Cider Security

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

When we write code, we often run many scanners for different purposes on our code - from linters, to testing, security scanning, secret scanning, and more.

Scanning the code occurs on developers' machines and in CI/CD pipelines, which assumes the code is untrusted and unverified and based on this assumption scanners shouldn't have the ability to dynamically run code.

Our research focuses on the many static analyzers out there if this is really the case. Many of the scanners allow different ways of interaction - From requesting external resources, overriding the configuration and to remote code execution as part of the process.This talk will be technical and show examples of well-known scanning tools and how we created code that attacks them.

TLDR -

When integrating and using new tools in our CI systems and especially when running on unverified code, Which tools can we trust and how can we scan safe untrusted code in a secure way?

### The Unbelievable Insecurity of the Big Data Stack: An Offensive Approach to Analyzing Huge and Complex Big Data Infrastructures

45 minutes | Demo

#### Sheila A. Berta Head of Research at Dreamlab Technologies

Virtual only presentation

Honoring the term, the variety of technologies in the Big Data stack is hugely BIG. Many complex components in charge of transport, storing, and processing millions of records make up Big Data infrastructures. The speed at which data needs to be processed and how quickly the implemented technologies need to communicate with each other make security lag behind. Once again, complexity is the worst enemy of security.

Today, when conducting a security assessment on Big Data infrastructures, there is currently no methodology for it and there are hardly any technical resources to analyze the attack vectors. On top of that, many things that are considered vulnerabilities in conventional infrastructures, or even in the Cloud, are not vulnerabilities in this stack. What is a security problem and what is not a security problem in Big Data infrastructures? That is one of the many questions that this research answers. Security professionals need to count on a methodology and acquire the necessary skills to competently analyze the security of such infrastructures.

This talk presents a methodology, and new and impactful attack vectors in the four layers of the Big Data stack: Data Ingestion, Data Storage, Data Processing and Data Access. Some of the techniques that will be exposed are the remote attack of the centralized cluster configuration managed by ZooKeeper; packet crafting for remote communication with the Hadoop RPC/IPC to compromise the HDFS; development of a malicious YARN application to achieve RCE; interfering data ingestion channels as well as abusing the drivers of HDFS-based storage technologies like Hive/HBase, and platforms to query multiple data lakes as Presto. In addition, security recommendations will be provided to prevent the attacks explained.

REFERENCES:

I plan to release a white paper at the conference, in the white paper there will be all the references. Anyway, as the attacks are novel, the references are related to infrastructure stuff mostly, not so much about security.

### Hacking G Suite: The Power of Dark Apps Script Magic

45 minutes | Tool

#### Matthew Bryant Red Team @ Snapchat

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

You‚Äôve seen plenty of talks on exploiting, escalating, and exfiltrating the magical world of Google Cloud (GCP), but what about its buttoned-down sibling? This talk delves into the dark art of utilizing Apps Script to exploit G Suite (AKA Google Workspace).

As a studious sorcerer, you‚Äôll discover how to pierce even the most fortified G Suite enterprises. You‚Äôll learn to conjure Apps Script payloads to bypass powerful protective enchantments such as U2F, OAuth app allowlisting, and locked-down enterprise Chromebooks.

Our incantations don‚Äôt stop at the perimeter, we will also discover novel spells to escalate our internal privileges and bring more G Suite accounts under our control. Once we‚Äôve obtained the access we seek, we‚Äôll learn various curses to persist ourselves whilst keeping a low profile so as to not risk an unwelcome exorcism.

You don‚Äôt need divination to see that this knowledge just might rival alchemy in value.

### PunkSPIDER and IOStation: Making a Mess All Over the Internet

45 minutes | Demo,Tool

#### \_hyp3ri0n aka Alejandro Caceres Director of Computer Network Exploitation at QOMPLX, former owner of Hyperion Gray

#### Jason Hopper Hacker

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

We've been getting asked a lot for "that tool that was like Shodan but for web app vulns.‚Äù In particular WTF happened to it? Punkspider (formerly known as PunkSPIDER but renamed because none of us could remember where tf the
capital letters go) was taken down a couple of years ago due to multiple ToS issues and threats. It was originally funded by DARPA. We weren‚Äôt sure in which direction to keep expanding, and it ended up being a nightmare to
sustain. We got banned more than a 15 year old with a fake ID trying to get into a bar. It became a pain and hardly sustainable without a lot of investment in time and money. Each time we got banned it meant thousands of dollars
and countless hours moving sh\*\* around.

Now we‚Äôve solved our problems and completely re-engineered/expanded the system. It is not only far more efficient with real-time distributed computing and checks for way more vulns, we had to take some creative ways through the
woods ‚Äì this presentation covers both the tool itself and the story of the path we had to take to get where it is, spoiler alert: it involves creating our own ISP and data center in Canada and integrating freely available data
that anyone can get but most don‚Äôt know is available. Come play with us and see what the wild west of the web looks like and listen to our story, it‚Äôs fun and full of angry web developers. We‚Äôll also be releasing at least 10s
of thousands of vulnerabilities and will be taking suggestions from the audience on what to search. Fun vulns found get a t-shirt, super fun ones get a hoodie thrown at them.

### Why does my security camera scream like a Banshee? Signal analysis and RE of a proprietary audio-data encoding protocol

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Rion Carter

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

All I wanted was a camera to monitor my pumpkin patch for pests, what I found was a wireless security camera that spoke with an accent and asked to speak with my fax machine. Join me as I engage in a signals analysis of the Amiccom 1080p Outdoor Security Camera and hack the signal to reverse engineer the audio tones used to communicate and configure this inexpensive outdoor camera. This journey takes us through spectrum-analysis, APK decompiling, tone generation in Android and the use of Ghidra for when things REALLY get hairy.

### Hack the hackers: Leaking data over SSL/TLS

20 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Ionut Cernica PHD Student @Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science, University Politehnica of Bucharest

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Have you considered that in certain situations the way hackers exploit vulnerabilities over the network can be predictable? Anyone with access to encrypted traffic can reverse the logic behind the exploit and thus obtain the same data as the exploit.

Various automated tools have been analyzed and it has been found that these tools operate in an unsafe way. Various exploit databases were analyzed and we learned that some of these are written in an insecure (predictable) way.

This presentation will showcase the results of the research, including examples of exploits that once executed can be harmful. The data we obtain after exploitation can be accessible to other entities without the need of decrypting the traffic. The SSL/TLS specs will not change. There is a clear reason for that and in this presentation I will argue this, but what will change for sure is the way hackers will write some of the exploits.

**Ionut Cernica**
 Ionut Cernica started his security career with the bug bounty program from Facebook. His passion for security led him to get involved in dozens of such programs and he found problems in very large companies such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, AT&T, eBay, VMware. He has also been testing web application security for 9 years and has had a large number of projects on the penetration testing side.

Another stage of his career was to get involved in security contests and participated in more than 100 such contests. He also reached important finals such as Codegate, Trend Micro and Defcon with the PwnThyBytes team. He also won several individual competitions, including the mini CTF from the first edition of Appsec village - Defcon village.

Now he is doing research in the field of web application security, being also a PhD student at University Polytechnic of Bucharest. Through his research he wants to innovate in the field and to bring a new layer of security to web applications. He has also been working as a Security Researcher @Future Networks 5G Lab for a few months now and hopes to make an important contribution to the 5G security area through research.

### Taking Apart and Taking Over ICS & SCADA Ecosystems: A Case Study of Mitsubishi Electric

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Mars Cheng Threat researcher for TXOne Networks

#### Selmon Yang Staff Engineer at TXOne Networks

Virtual only presentation

Diversified Industrial Control System (ICS) providers create a variety of ecosystems, which have come to operate silently in the background of our lives. Among these organizations, Mitsubishi Electric ranks among the most prolific. Because the operation of this ecosystem is so widely used in key manufacturing, natural gas supply, oil, water, aviation, railways, chemicals, food and beverages, and construction, it is closely-related to people's lives. For this reason, the security of this ecosystem is extraordinarily important.

This research will enter the Mitsubishi ecosystem‚Äôs communication protocol, using it as a lens with which to deeply explore the differences between itself and other ecosystems. We will show how we successfully uncovered flaws in its identity authentication function, including how to take it over and show that such an attack can cause physical damage in different critical sectors. We‚Äôll explain how we accomplished this by applying reverse engineering and communication analysis. This flaw allows attackers to take over any asset within the entire series of Mitsubishi PLCs, allowing command of the ecosystem and full control of the relevant sensors. A further complication is that making a fix to the various communication protocols in the ICS/SCADA is extremely difficult. We will also share the various problems we encountered while researching these findings and provide the most workable detection and mitigation strategies for those protocols.

### Crossover Episode: The Real-Life Story of the First Mainframe Container Breakout

45 minutes | Demo

#### Ian Coldwater Hacker

#### Chad Rikansrud (Bigendian Smalls) Hacker

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

You've seen talks about container hacking. You've seen talks about mainframe hacking. But how often do you see them together? IBM decided to put containers on a mainframe, so a container hacker and a mainframe hacker decided to join forces and hack it. We became the first people on the planet to escape a container on a mainframe, and we‚Äôre going to show you how.

Containers on a mainframe? For real. IBM zCX is a Docker environment running on a custom Linux hypervisor built atop z/OS - IBM‚Äôs mainframe operating system. Building this platform introduces mainframe environments to a new generation of cloud-native developers-and introduces new attack surfaces that weren‚Äôt there before.

In this crossover episode, we‚Äôre going to talk about how two people with two very particular sets of skills went about breaking zCX in both directions, escaping containers into the mainframe host and spilling the secrets of the container implementation from the mainframe side.

When two very different technologies get combined for the first time, the result is new shells nobody‚Äôs ever popped before.

Mired in the hell of a global pandemic, hospital capacity stressed to its limit, doctors and nurses overworked and exhausted... surely the baddies would cut us a little slack and leave little 'ol healthcare alone for a bit, right? Well, raise your hand if you saw this one coming. Another year of rampaging ransomware, of pwned patient care- only this time backdropped by the raging dumpster fire that is COVID. Can we once and for all dispel with the Pollyannas telling us that nobody would knowingly seek to harm patients? And if we can't convince the powers that be- whether in the hospital C-suite or in DC- that we need to take this $%& seriously now, then what hope do we have for pushing patient safety to the forefront when things return to some semblance of normal? With a heavily curated panel including policy badasses, elite hackers, and seasoned clinicians - D0 N0 H4RM remains the preeminent forum where insight from experts collide with the ingenuity and imagination of the DEF CON grassroots to inspire activism and collaboration stretching far beyond closing ceremonies.

Moderated by physician hackers quaddi and r3plicant, this perennially packed event always fills up fast - so make sure you join us. As always- the most important voice is yours.

#### Roy Davis Senior Security Engineer, Zoom Video Communications

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Since the late great Barnaby Jack gave us ‚ÄúJack Potting‚Äù in the late 2000s, there have been several talks on ATM network attacks, USB port attacks, and digital locks attacks which apply to several brands of ATM safes. In this session, I‚Äôll discuss and demonstrate how most of these known attack vectors have been remediated, while several fairly simple attacks against the machine and the safe still remain. We‚Äôll dive into how ATMs work, the steps I went through to become a ‚Äúlicenced ATM operator‚Äù which enabled my research, and how I identified the vulnerabilities. I‚Äôll show how, with very little technical expertise and 20 minutes, these attacks lead directly past ‚Äúsecure‚Äù and allow attackers to collect a lot more than $200.

### Unlocking KeeLoq ‚Äì A Reverse Engineering Story

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Rogan Dawes Researcher, Orange Cyberdefense‚Äôs SensePost Team

Virtual only presentation

KeeLoq Remote Keyless Entry systems make use of radio frequency transmissions to operate and have many known weaknesses. A 64-bit manufacturer key is used in transmissions to encrypt an incrementing transmission sequence number in order to provide replay protection. This presentation is a journey into bringing existing research together to make personal Keeloq projects practical, ultimately repurposing a commercial receiver as part of a home automation system integration project.

I will demonstrate how I recovered the manufacturer key by extracting and reverse engineering the receiver‚Äôs firmware using a JTAG adapter and Ghidra. Next, I will cover decoding and decrypting the KeeLoq transmissions (verified using a logic analyzer), cloning the captured serial and sequence numbers to a new transmitter, and finally, how to export the received transmissions to a home automation system via an add-on WiFi-capable microcontroller.

### Instrument and Find Out: Writing Parasitic Tracers for High(-Level) Languages

20 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Jeff Dileo Technical Director, NCC Group

Virtual only presentation

Modern programming languages are, more and more, being designed not just around performance, ease-of-use, and (sometimes) security, but also performance monitoring and introspectability. But what about the languages that never adopted such concepts from their peers? Or worse, what about the languages that tacked on half-hearted implementations as an afterthought? The answer is simple, you write your own and instrument them into the language dynamically.

In this talk, we will discuss the process for developing generalized parasitic tracers targeting specific programming languages and runtimes using Ruby as our case study. We will show how feasible it is to write external tracers targeting a language and its runtime, and discuss best practices for supporting different versions over time.

### Vulnerability Exchange: One Domain Account For More Than Exchange Server RCE

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Tianze Ding Senior security researcher, Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab

Virtual only presentation

Microsoft Exchange Server is one of the most famous mail servers in the world. It not only stores a large amount of sensitive corporate information, but also plays an important role in Microsoft Active Directory, so it has become a high-value target for both APT groups and red teams.

In the past few months, some high-risk vulnerabilities in Exchange Server have been exposed, which mainly target vulnerable ASP.NET code. But the architecture of Exchange Server is complicated, and its attack surface is not limited to ASP.NET, this talk will analyze and attack Exchange Server from a different perspective.

I will share the following two new vulnerabilities I found, as well as the new attack surfaces and how I chained several techniques to successfully exploit them in detail.

1. One of them can result in arbitrary mailbox takeover, attackers can read emails, download attachments, send emails, etc. as any Exchange user.

2. The other can lead to remote code execution on Exchange Server, attackers can gain local administrator privileges and execute arbitrary commands. Furthermore, there is an interesting point, even if you have applied the latest Exchange Server patches, your Exchange Server may still be compromised by this type of attack.

For red teams, Exchange Server RCE is only the beginning. Usually, there are some high-privileged domain users and groups on Exchange Server, I will also introduce a new method in depth to help you perform lateral movement and even privilege escalation to Domain Admin after achieving Exchange Server RCE.

These vulnerabilities have been reported to MSRC and the exploit tools will be released after the talk.

### Response Smuggling: Pwning HTTP/1.1 Connections

45 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Martin Doyhenard Security Researcher at Onapsis

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Over the past few years, we have seen some novel presentations re-introducing the concept of HTTP request smuggling, to reliably exploit complex landscapes and systems. With advanced techniques, researchers were able to bypass restrictions and breach the security of critical web applications.

This presentation will take a new approach, focusing on the response pipeline desynchronization, a rather unexplored attack vector in HTTP Smuggling.

First, I will introduce a Desync variant, using connection-tokens to hide arbitrary headers from the backend. This technique does not abuse discrepancy between HTTP parsers, but instead relies on a vulnerability in the protocol itself!

The issue was found and reported under Google‚Äôs Vulnerability Reward Program for a nice bounty!

Next, I will show how it is possible to inject multiple messages at the backend server, mixing the pipeline‚Äôs connection order, and hijack users sessions from login requests.

Finally, using a novel technique known as Response Scripting, I will demonstrate how to create malicious outbound messages using static responses as the building blocks. This will be leveraged to write custom responses and take control of one of the most popular protocols in history!

### Worming through IDEs

20 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### David Dworken Security Engineer, Google

Virtual only presentation

You might think that as long as you never hit run, opening up that interesting new POC in your IDE and checking out the code is safe. But it isn't. IDEs and developer tools are complex pieces of software that have vulnerabilities, just like everything else.

We'll start by discussing what a reasonable threat model is for IDEs. How do companies threat model their IDEs? What do users expect of their IDEs? Is viewing a file equivalent to executing it?

Then we'll dive into the reality of it. Nearly every IDE examined was trivially vulnerable. But there were also a variety of subtle bugs lying underneath. We'll look at bugs in both local IDEs (like VSCode and IntelliJ) and cloud-based IDEs (like AWS Cloud9 and Github Codespaces).

Finally, we'll show how an attacker could make a worm that would spread through attacking IDEs. View a malicious project? Let's automatically backdoor every project on a computer and keep spreading.

### eBPF, I thought we were friends !

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Guillaume Fournier Security Engineer at Datadog

#### Sylvain Afchain Staff Engineer at Datadog

#### Sylvain Baubeau Staff Engineer at Datadog

Virtual only presentation

Since its first appearance in Kernel 3.18, eBPF (Extended Berkley Packet Filter) has progressively become a key technology for observability in the Linux kernel. Initially dedicated to network monitoring, eBPF can now be used to monitor and trace any kind of kernel space activity.

Over the past few years, many vendors have started using eBPF to speed up their services or introduce innovative features. Cilium, Calico, Cloudflare, Netflix and Facebook are leading the charge, showing off new complex networking use cases on a monthly basis. On the security side of things, Google recently contributed the Kernel Runtime Security Instrumentation which opens the door to writing Linux Security Modules with eBPF.

In other words, eBPF is the new kid in town and a growing number of companies are running services with eBPF access in production. This leads us to a simple question: how bad can things get if one of those services were to be compromised ? This talk will cover how we leveraged eBPF to implement a full blown rootkit with all the features you would expect: various obfuscation techniques, command and control with remote and persistent access, data theft and exfiltration techniques, Runtime Application Self-Protection evasion techniques, and finally two original container breakout techniques.

Simply put, our goal is to demonstrate that rogue kernel modules might have finally found a worthy opponent. We will also detail how to detect such attacks and protect your infrastructure from them, while safely enjoying the exciting capabilities that eBPF has to offer.

### DoS: Denial of Shopping ‚Äì Analyzing and Exploiting (Physical) Shopping Cart Immobilization Systems

20 minutes

#### Joseph Gabay Hacker

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Many supermarkets and shopping centers have implemented devices that ‚Äúlock‚Äù their shopping carts if they‚Äôre taken outside of an approved boundary (e.g, a parking lot). This talk examines some of the technology that‚Äôs used to do this, as well as ways to capture and spoof the control signals to defeat these devices.

We will go over the anatomy of remotely lockable shopping cart wheels, their basic theory, and get into how they‚Äôre controlled. We‚Äôll deconstruct some samples of the lock and unlock signals captured using a homemade antenna and a HackRF, and briefly discuss methods of rebroadcasting them ‚Äì as well as the challenges inherent to this process.

### Robots with lasers and cameras (but no security): Liberating your vacuum from the cloud

45 minutes | Tool, Exploit

#### Dennis Giese Hacker

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Vacuum robots are becoming increasingly popular and affordable as their technology grows ever more advanced, including sensors like lasers and cameras. It is easy to imagine interesting new projects to exploit these capabilities. However, all of them rely on sending data to the cloud. Do you trust the companies promise that no video streams are uploaded to the cloud and that your personal data is safe? Why not collect the dust with open-source software?

I previously showed ways to root robots such as Roborock and Xiaomi, which enabled owners to use their devices safely with open-source home automation. In response, vendors began locking down their devices with technologies like Secure Boot, SELinux, LUKS encrypted partitions and custom crypto that prevents gaining control over our own devices. This talk will update my newest methods for rooting these devices.

The market of vacuum robots expanded in the past 2 years. In particular, the Dreame company has recently released many models with interesting hardware, like ToF cameras and line lasers. This can be a nice alternative for rooting. I will show easy ways to get root access on these devices and bypass all security. I will also discuss backdoors and security issues I discovered from analysis. You will be surprised what the developers left in the firmware.

### Defeating Physical Intrusion Detection Alarm Wires

45 minutes | Tool

#### Bill Graydon Principal, Research, GGR Security

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Alarm systems are ubiquitous - no longer the realm of banks and vaults only, many people now have them in their homes or workplaces. But how do they work? And the logical follow-up question - how can they be hacked?

This talk focuses on the communication lines in physical intrusion detection systems: how they are secured, and what vulnerabilities exist. We‚Äôll discuss the logic implemented in the controllers and protections on the communication lines including end of line resistors - and all the ways that this aspect of the system can be exploited.

In particular, we‚Äôll release schematics for a tool we‚Äôve developed that will enable measuring end-of-line resistor systems covertly, determining the necessary re-wiring to defeat the sensors, and deploy it without setting off the alarm.

After the talk, you can head over to the Lock Bypass Village to try these techniques out for yourself!

### Phantom Attack: Evading System Call Monitoring

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Rex Guo Head of Research, Confluera

#### Junyuan Zeng Senior Software Engineer, Linkedin

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Phantom attack is a collection of attacks that evade Linux system call monitoring. A user mode program does not need any special privileges or capabilities to reliably evade system call monitoring using Phantom attack by exploiting insecure tracing implementations.

After adversaries gain an initial foothold on a Linux system, they typically perform post-exploitation activities such as reconnaissance, execution, privilege escalation, persistence, etc. It is extremely difficult if not impossible to perform any non-trivial adversarial activities without using Linux system calls.

Security monitoring solutions on Linux endpoints typically offer system call monitoring to effectively detect attacks. Modern solutions often use either ebpf-based programs or kernel modules to monitor system calls through tracepoint and/or kprobe. Any adversary operations including abnormal and/or suspicious system calls reveal additional information to the defenders and can trigger detection alerts.

We will explain the generic nature of the vulnerabilities exploited by Phantom attack. We will demonstrate Phantom attack on two popular open source Linux system call monitoring solutions Falco (Sysdig) and Tracee (Aquasecurity). We will also explain the differences between Phantom v1 and v2 attacks. Finally, we will discuss mitigations for Phantom attack and secure tracing in the broader context beyond system call tracing.

### TEMPEST radio station

45 minutes | Tool

#### Paz Hameiri Hacker

Virtual only presentation

TEMPEST is a cyber security term that refers to the use of electromagnetic energy emissions generated by electronic devices to leak data out of a target device.
The attacks may be passive (where the attacker receives the emissions and recovers the data) or active (where the attacker uses dedicated malware to target and emit specific data).

In this talk I present a new side channel attack that uses GPU memory transfers to emit electromagnetic waves which are then received and processed by the attacker.
Software developed for this work encodes audio on one computer and transmits it to the reception equipment positioned fifty feet away.
The signals are received and processed and the audio is decoded and played. The maximum bit rate achieved was 33kbit/s and more than 99% of the packets were received.

Frequency selection not only enables maximization of signal quality over distance, but also enables the attacker to receive signals from a specific computer when several computers in the area are active. The software developed demonstrates audio packets transfers, but other types of digital data may be transmitted using the same technique.

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

For decades, the EICAR test string has been used by antivirus and security vendors to safely test their detection engines without having to use live virulent samples which could cause harm. What would happen if you took that string, encoded it into a machine readable format like a QR code and started scanning various devices with the QR code? This talk shows how there are a lot of systems out there that aren't expecting an input string like EICAR and how many of them just collapse when shown the code. We will also discuss the types of systems you can target and how you may be able to extend this to more than a nuisance attack.

### Sleight of ARM: Demystifying Intel Houdini

45 minutes | Demo

#### Brian Hong Security Consultant, NCC Group

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

In the recent years, we have seen some of the major players in the industry switch from x86-based processors to ARM processors. However, you might be surprised to know that Intel has long supported ARM to x86 transition with their binary translator, Houdini, which runs ARM binaries on x86.

In this talk, we will discuss Intel's proprietary Houdini translator, which is primarily used by Android on x86 platforms, such as higher-end Chromebooks and desktop Android emulators. We will start with a high-level discussion of how Houdini works and is loaded into processes. We will then dive into the low-level internals of the Houdini engine and memory model, including several security weaknesses it introduces into processes using it. Lastly, we will discuss methods to escape the Houdini environment, execute arbitrary ARM and x86, and write Houdini-targeted malware that bypasses existing platform analysis.

45 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Zhipeng Huo Senior Researcher, Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab

#### Yuebin Sun Senior Researcher, Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab

#### Chuanda Ding Senior Researcher, Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab

Virtual only presentation

Apple's iOS, macOS and other OS have existed for a long time. There are numerous interesting logic bugs hidden for many years.
We demonstrated the world's first public 0day exploit running natively on Apple M1 on a MacBook Air (M1, 2020). Without any modification, we exploited an iPhone 12 Pro with the same bug.

In this talk, we will show you the advantage and beauty of the IPC logic bugs, how we rule all Apple platforms, Intel and Apple Silicon alike, even with all the latest hardware mitigations enabled, without changing one line of code.
We would talk about the security features introduced by Apple M1, like Pointer Authentication Code (PAC), System Integrity, and Data Protection. How did they make exploiting much harder to provide better security and protect user's privacy.
We will talk about different IPC mechanisms like Mach Message, XPC, and NSXPC. They are widely used on Apple platforms which could be abused to break the well designed security boundaries.

We will walk you through some incredibly fun logic bugs we have discovered, share the stories behind them and methods of finding them, and also talk about how to exploit these logic bugs to achieve privilege escalation.

### New Phishing Attacks Exploiting OAuth Authentication Flows

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Jenko Hwong Netskope Threat Research team

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

OAuth 2.0 device authorization gives users on limited-input devices like TVs an easier way to authenticate against and authorize a cloud website/app by entering a code on a computer/phone. This authentication and authorization flow leads to new phishing attacks that:

- do not need server infrastructure--the login page is served by the authorization provider using their domain and cert

- do not require a client application--application identities can be reused/spoofed

- do not require user consent of application permissions

Since the phish attacks hijack oauth session tokens, MFA will be ineffective as the attacker does not need to reauthenticate. The ability to defend against these attacks is hindered by limited info and functionality to detect, mitigate, and prevent session token compromise.

I'll demonstrate these new phishing attacks, access to sensitive user data, and lateral movement.

Defensive measures against these phishing attacks will be discussed, specifically the challenges in detection, mitigation, and prevention, and the overall lack of support for managing temporary credentials.

Open-source tools have been developed and will be used to demonstrate how users can:

- self-phish their organizations using these techniques

- audit security settings that help prevent/mitigate the attacks

It's 2021. You‚Äôre still here! You‚Äôre vaccinated! You should be happy and carefree! And yet‚Ä¶the PACS-man still haunts us all. Why should this be? Don‚Äôt we have newer, better tech with more bits of encryption and fewer wires? Haven‚Äôt the professional sentinels we‚Äôve entrusted with our physical security software-defined ALL THE THINGS and made them better?

Nay, these are but fruits of the poisonous physical security tree! Come, fellow hackers and weary travelers, visit with the ghosts of access control and learn of the lies they‚Äôve laid before us!

Come see how false guardians have used BLE slight-of-hand to increase complexity and cost while reducing security and ask that they be paid a tithing for the privilege!
Witness young software-defined gladiators do battle in an arena they did not prepare for and falter!

Behold as our friendly ghosts of access control forge never-before seen tools to help slay false security prophets!

### Wibbly Wobbly, Timey Wimey ‚Äì What's Really Inside Apple's U1 Chip

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### jiska TU Darmstadt, SEEMOO

#### Alexander Heinrich TU Darmstadt, SEEMOO

Virtual only presentation

Apple introduced an Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip in the iPhone 11. Its cryptographically secured spatial measurement capabilities are accessible via the Nearby Interaction framework since iOS 14. As of now, it only supports interaction with other Apple devices including the latest Apple Watch and HomePod mini. These are the first steps to support UWB in a larger ecosystem, as measuring precise distance and direction can be an enabler for various future applications. The automotive industry already announced UWB support for mobile car keys on the iPhone.

But what‚Äôs really inside Apple‚Äôs U1 chip, internally called Rose? In this talk, we will travel through time, space, firmware and kernel components‚Äîand fight daemons to modify firmware interaction from user space. This will not only cover one or two, but three firmwares that process or forward each Rose time measurement: The Rose Digital Signal Processor (DSP), Rose Application Processor (AP), and the Always-On Processor (AOP).

### Rotten code, aging standards, & pwning IPv4 parsing across nearly every mainstream programming language

45 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Kelly Kaoudis

#### Sick Codes Hacker

Virtual only presentation

Openness to responsibly disclosed external vulnerability research is crucial for modern software maintainers and security teams. Changes in upstream dependency code may have pulled the safety rug out from underneath widely trusted core libraries, leaving millions of services vulnerable to unsophisticated attacks. The impact of even a single reasonably well-distributed supply-chain security vulnerability will be felt by engineering teams across many applications, companies, and industries.

We'd like to discuss an IP address parsing vulnerability first discovered in private-ip, a small and infrequently maintained yet critically important NodeJS package for determining if an IP address should be considered part of a private range or not. We'll talk about not only the implications of this CVE but taking the main idea and applying it across multiple programming languages in uniquely disturbing ways.

Sometimes, the effects of code rot are even more far-reaching than we could possibly expect, and if you pull on a thread, it just keeps going. Sometimes, you get lucky when you know exactly what you're looking for. Sometimes, it's hard to convince other technically-minded folks that a seemingly trivial implementation flaw is dangerous in capable hands.

This talk is beginner as well as advanced-friendly; we'll show you the basics a hacker or a programmer needs to know about IP address parsing and how to tell your octal from your decimal along the way.

### HTTP/2: The Sequel is Always Worse

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### James Kettle Director of Research, PortSwigger Web Security

Virtual only presentation

HTTP/2 is easily mistaken for a transport-layer protocol that can be swapped in with zero security implications for the website behind it. Two years ago, I presented HTTP Desync Attacks and kicked off a wave of request smuggling, but HTTP/2 escaped serious analysis. In this presentation, I'll take you beyond the frontiers of existing HTTP/2 research, to unearth horrifying implementation flaws and subtle RFC oversights.

I'll show you how these flaws enable HTTP/2-exclusive desync attacks, with case studies targeting high-profile websites powered by servers ranging from Amazon's Application Load Balancer to WAFs, CDNs, and bespoke stacks by big tech. I'll demonstrate critical impact by hijacking thick clients, poisoning caches, and stealing plaintext passwords to net multiple max-bounties.

After that, I'll unveil novel techniques and tooling to crack open a widespread but overlooked request smuggling variant affecting both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 that is typically mistaken for a false positive.

Finally, I'll drop multiple exploit-primitives that resurrect a largely-forgotten class of vulnerability, and use HTTP/2 to expose fresh application-layer attack surface.

I'll leave you with an open-source scanner, a custom, open-source HTTP/2 stack, and free interactive labs so you can hone your new skills on live systems.

### Over-the-air remote code execution on the DEF CON 27 badge via Near Field Magnetic Inductance or World‚Äôs first NFMI exploitation, sorta or OTARCEDC27NFMIOMGWTFBBQ

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Seth Kintigh Hardware Security Engineer, Dell

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

The DEF CON 27 badge employed an obscure form of wireless communication: Near Field Magnetic Inductance (NFMI). The badges were part of a contest and while poking through the firmware for hints I noticed a buffer overflow flaw. All it required to exploit it was an oversized packet‚Ä¶ via a chip with no datasheet and no documentation on the proprietary protocol. Thus started a 2 year odyssey.

I used Software Defined Radio tools to study the signal‚Äôs modulations. I built a receiver in GNURadio and Python to convert signals into symbols, symbols obfuscated by a pattern that I had to deduce while only controlling a fraction of the bytes. Data was encoded in those symbols using proprietary convolution for even bits and Trellis Code Modulation for odd bits. I then reversed their bizarre CRC and wrote tools to craft and send packets. Using those tools I chained bugs in 2 chips and remotely crashed the badge. However, limitations in the NFMI protocol made more sophisticated attacks impossible.

But after a year and a half invested, I was not about to give up. I soldered leads to middle layer traces, extracted and reverse engineered the NFMI firmware, fixed their protocol, and patched a badge FW to patch the NFMI FW. At long last I achieved what may be the world‚Äôs first, over-the-air, remote code exploit via NFMI.

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

As if 2020 and 2021 were not bad enough, the Covid-19 pandemic seemed to have been accompanied by a new rash of bad cyber- attacks on major platforms like Solarwinds and Microsoft, infrastructures worldwide subverted in ransomware campaigns, and even the very organizations researching and fighting the pandemic have been hit.

Meanwhile, the hard work of cyber diplomacy continues, with talks on war and peace in the United Nations reaching a new stage as two working groups presented their final report and a third one is in the process of being born. Mostly the topics are on establishing norms on cyber behavior, rules of the road of what states can do in cyberspace.¬† But where are the hackers in all this? The Internet is famously not run by intergovernmental organizations, so the companies, civil society groups and others should somehow be involved ‚Äì and one of the UN processes did in fact make a small step in that direction. But the staid ways of pin-striped cyber are hard to change. What is the best way for the community to engage?

### Fuzzing Linux with Xen

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Tamas K Lengyel Senior Security Researcher, Intel

Virtual only presentation

Last year we've successfully upstreamed a new feature to Xen that allows high-speed fuzzing of virtual machines (VMs) using VM-forking. Recently through collaboration with the Xen community external monitoring of VMs via Intel(r) Processor Trace has also been upstreamed. Combined with the native Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) capability Xen now provides a unique platform for fuzzing and binary analysis.

To illustrate the power of the platform we'll present the details of a real-world fuzzing operation that targeted Linux kernel-modules from an attack-vector that has previously been hard to reach: memory exposed to devices via Direct Memory Access (DMA) for fast I/O. If the input the kernel reads from DMA-exposed memory is malformed or malicious - what could happen?

So far we discovered: 9 NULL-pointer dereferences; 3 array index out-of-bound accesses; 2 infinite-loops in IRQ context and 2 instances of tricking the kernel into accessing user-memory but thinking it is kernel memory. The bugs have been in Linux for many years and were found in kernel modules used by millions of devices. All bugs are now fixed upstream.

This talk will walk you through how the bugs were found: what process we went through to identify the right code-locations; how we analyzed the kernel source and how we analyzed the runtime of the kernel with Xen to pinpoint the input points that read from DMA. The talk will explain the steps required to attach a debugger through the hypervisor to collect kernel crash logs and how to perform triaging of bugs via VM-fork execution-replay, a novel technique akin to time-travel debugging. Finally, we'll close with the release of a new open-source tool to perform full-VM taint analysis using Xen and Intel(r) Processor Trace.

### Hacking Humans with AI as a Service

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Eugene Lim Cybersecurity Specialist, Government Technology Agency of Singapore

#### Tan Kee Hock Cybersecurity Specialist, Government Technology Agency of Singapore

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

As the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) products such as OpenAI's GPT-3 API places advanced synthetic media generation capabilities in the hands of a global audience at a fraction of the cost, what does the future hold for AI-assisted social engineering attacks? In our talk, we will present the nuts and bolts of an AIaaS phishing pipeline that was successfully deployed in multiple authorized phishing campaigns. Using both paid and free services, we emulated the techniques that even low-skilled, limited resource actors could adopt to execute effective AI-assisted phishing campaigns at scale. By repurposing easily-accessible personality analysis AIaaS products, we generated persuasive phishing emails that were automatically personalized based on a target's public social media information and created by state-of-the-art natural language generators. We will also discuss how an AI-assisted phishing workflow would impact traditional social engineering teams and operations. Finally, we look at how AIaaS suppliers can mitigate the misuse of their products.

### Do you like to read? I know how to take over your Kindle with an e-book

20 minutes

#### Slava Makkaveev Security Researcher, Check Point

Virtual only presentation

Since 2007, Amazon has sold tens of millions of Kindles, which is impressive. But this also means that tens of millions of people can be hacked through a software bug in those same Kindles. Their devices can be turned into bots, their private local networks can be compromised, and perhaps even information in their billing accounts can be stolen.

The easiest way to remotely reach a user's Kindle is through an e-book. A malicious book can be published and made available for free access in any virtual library, including the Kindle Store, or sent directly to the end-user device via Amazon services.
While you might not be happy with the writing in a particular book, nobody expects to download one that is malicious. No such scenarios have been publicized. Antiviruses do not have signatures for e-books.
But... we succeeded in making a malicious book for you. If you open this book on a Kindle device, it causes a hidden piece of code to be executed with root rights. From this moment on, you lost your e-reader, account and more.

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

According to a former senior White House official, 2020 was the year that ransomware went from being a nuisance to a full-scale national security threat and a ‚Äúscourge‚Äù. After an awkward adolescence spent shaking down individual users for a couple hundred dollars and a big debut in 2017 with WannaCry and NotPetya , ransomware really hit the big time in 2020. Ransom payments may have topped $400 million plus that year. But those sums are nothing compared to the damage that ransomware campaigns can cause, especially when they hit critical infrastructure like Colonial Pipeline. And even months after Colonial Pipeline, ransomware continues to regularly subvert and cripple enterprises in the US and Europe. Are we not learning the right lessons on defense? Or is it not just an infosec problem, but also an international security issue, with cybercrime being actively wielded ‚Äì yet again ‚Äì as a political weapon?

#### Vivek Nair Ph.D. Student, EECS department, UC Berkeley

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

It's a tale as old as time: a graduating senior needs two more courses to graduate, but the lectures happen to be scheduled at the same time and the school's new high-tech wireless attendance tracking system makes it impossible to attend both courses... in theory. By reverse-engineering the attendance devices and emulating them using a hidden Arduino, the system can be tricked into giving attendance credit for both courses without being physically present. It's a real-life "time turner," allowing him to be in two places at once.

In 1998 the US government issued the first major policy document on Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP). Since then, CIP has become one of the most fundamental tasks for governments everywhere, and has given birth to a plethora of institutions and processes seeking to manage what is called a ‚ÄúPublic Private Partnership‚Äù between government, industry, and civil society. But despite all the efforts put into information exchanges, incident management, but also supply chain protection and even national industrial policies, cyber-attacks have not decreased, both in the United States and elsewhere. What else needs to be done? What lessons learned are there from international experiences? And how can the community help best?

### Gone Apple Pickin': Red Teaming macOS Environments in 2021

45 minutes | Demo

#### Cedric Owens Offensive Security Engineer

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Though the vast majority of US companies are enterprise Windows shops, there is a growing percentage of companies that are shifting away from this model. Most of these types of companies tend to be based in the SF Bay Area and are often tech companies. This talk will provide a glimpse into what common attack paths in these environments look like in the absence of typical enterprise Active Directory implementations. Examples include techniques for targeting macOS endpoints, cloud and IdaaS, CI/CD pipeline, and other fun approaches. I will begin by discussing common tech stacks and macOS deployments and then move into macOS initial access (including the Gatekeeper bypass I found) and post exploitation options in these modern tech environments as well as detection opportunities.

### Warping Reality - creating and countering the next generation of Linux rootkits using eBPF

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### PatH Security Researcher

Virtual only presentation

With complete access to a system, Linux kernel rootkits are perfectly placed to hide malicious access and activity. However, running code in the kernel comes with the massive risk that any change to a kernel version or configuration can mean the difference between running successfully and crashing the entire system. This talk will cover how to use extended Berkley Packet Filters (eBPF) to create kernel rootkits that are safe, stable, stealthy, and portable.

eBPF is one of the newest additions to the Linux kernel, designed to easily load safe, constrained, and portable programs into the kernel to observe and make decisions about network traffic, syscalls, and more. But that‚Äôs not it‚Äôs only use: by creating eBPF programs that target specific processes we can warp reality, presenting a version of a file to one program and a different version to another, all without altering the real file on disk. This enables techniques such as presenting a backdoor user to ssh while hiding from sysadmins, or smuggling data inside connections from legitimate programs. This talk will also cover how to use these same techniques in malware analysis to fool anti-sanbox checks.

These ideas and more are explored in this talk alongside practical methods to detect and prevent this next generation of Linux rootkits.

### Hi! I'm DOMAIN\Steve, please let me access VLAN2

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Justin Perdok Security Specialist, Orange Cyberdefense Netherlands

Virtual only presentation

By responding to probing requests made by Palo Alto and SonicWALL firewalls, it's possible to apply security policies to arbitrary IPs on the network, allowing access to segmented resources.

Segmentation using firewalls is a critical security component for an organization. To scale, many firewall vendors have features that make rule implementation simpler, such as basing effective access on a user identity or workstation posture. Security products that probe client computers often have their credentials abused by either cracking a password hash, or by relaying an authentication attempt elsewhere. Prior work by Esteban Rodriguez and by Xavier Mertens cover this. In this talk I will show a new practical attack on identity-based firewalls to coerce them into applying chosen security policies to arbitrary IPs on a network by spoofing logged in users instead of cracking passwords.

Logged on user information is often gathered using the WKST (Workstation Service Remote Protocol) named pipe. By extending Impacket with the ability to respond to these requests, logged on users on a device can be spoofed, and arbitrary firewall rules applied.

We will dive into the details of how client probing has historically been a feature that should be avoided while introducing a new practical attack to emphasize that fact.

Virtual only presentation

Think of a random number between '0' and infinity. Was your number '0'? Seriously? Crap. Well unfortunately, the hardware random number generators (RNG) used by your favorite IoT devices to create encryption keys may not work much better than you when it comes to randomness.
In this talk, we'll delve into murky design specs, opaque software libraries, and lots of empirical results. We wrote code for many popular IoT SoC platforms to extract gigabytes of data from their hardware RNGs and analyze them. What we found was a systemic minefield of vulnerabilities in almost every platform that could undermine IoT security. Something needs to change in how the Internet of Things does RNG.
The vulnerabilities are widespread and the attacks are practical. RNG is bad out there - "IoT Crypto-pocalypse" bad.

### Hacking the Apple AirTags

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Thomas Roth Hacker

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Apple‚Äôs AirTags enable tracking of personal belongings. They are the most recent
and cheapest device interacting with the Apple ecosystem. In contrast to other
tracking devices, they feature Ultrawide-band precise positioning and leverage
almost every other Apple device within the Find My localization network.

Less than 10 days after the AirTag release, we bypassed firmware protections by
glitching the nRF52 microcontroller. This opens the AirTags for firmware
analysis and modification. In this talk, we will explain the initial nRF52
bypass as well as various hacks built on top of this. In particular, AirTags can
now act as phishing device by providing malicious links via the NFC interface,
be cloned and appear at a completely different location, used without privacy
protections that should alert users as tracking protection, act as low-quality
microphone by reutilizing the accelerometer, and send arbitrary data via the
Find My network. Besides these malicious use cases, AirTags are now a research
platform that even allows access to the new Ultrawide-band chip U1.

### MAVSH> Attacking from Above

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Sach Hacker

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Over the course of 2020 and 2021, drone enthusiasts and the FAA have been locked in a series of legal battles over the future of unmanned aviation.

New regulations and restrictions, such as Remote Identification, aim to leave drone and model aviation hobbyists with a grim choice: incur countless financial costs, or lose the ability to fly freely.

Not only do these regulations impact hobbyists, they also restrict our ability to use drones as recon and payload delivery tools, but the FAA gave us a loophole.

In this talk, I'll share my knowledge of the MAVLink protocol and how it can be modified to take advantage of that loophole. I'll also show you how to build a drone capable of 20+ minute flights, potentially multiple miles of range, and hosting a Raspberry Pi 0 W onboard, enabling remote command execution without the use of onboard WiFi or cellular networks ALL while exploiting that loophole.

Come learn how and why the FAA "Can't Stop the Signal"!

### Adventures in MitM-land: Using Machine-in-the-Middle to Attack Active Directory Authentication Schemes

45 minutes | Demo

#### Sagi Sheinfeld Sr. Engineer, CrowdStrike

#### Eyal Karni Sr. Engineer, CrowdStrike

#### Yaron Zinar Sr. Manager, Engineering, CrowdStrike

Virtual only presentation

Over the years, researchers were able to break many secure protocols using MitM attacks. A common theme in this family of vulnerabilities is the lack of proper validation for any of the communicating parties. We will review previous MitM attacks found on AD authentication protocols and the mitigation strategies previously implemented. We will show that the relay attack technique is not limited to NTLM alone and can be used to attack the newer Kerberos authentication protocol. In addition, we will show several injection attacks compromising client systems. We‚Äôll show how the lack of validation can lead to devastating issues ranging from authentication bypass to remote code execution on various critical infrastructure systems. However, the issues do not stop on Windows on-premises networks but span to other infrastructure such as domain-joined unix machines, virtualization infrastructure, open-source security audit tools and even cloud directories. The talk will deep-dive into multiple vulnerabilities we have discovered along with several demos. Demos include a MitM attack which allows an attacker to inject user passwords in a hybrid AD environment allowing the attacker to authenticate as any user in the network. We will also show how to use a similar technique to compromise many other IT infrastructure.

### High-Stakes Updates | BIOS RCE OMG WTF BBQ

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Mickey Shkatov Hacker

#### Jesse Michael HAcker

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

With attacks moving below the operating system and computer firmware vulnerability discovery on the rise, the need to keep current platforms updated becomes important and new technology is developed to help defend against such threats. Major computer manufacturers are adding capabilities to make it easier to update BIOS.

Our research has identified multiple vulnerabilities in Dell's BiosConnect feature used for remote update and recovery of the operating system. These vulnerabilities are easy to exploit by an adversary in the right position, and are not prevented by protective technologies such as Secured Core PCs, BitLocker, BootGuard, and BIOS Guard.

Join us and together we will explore the new attack surfaces introduced by these UEFI firmware update mechanisms -- including a full walk-through of multiple vulnerability findings and the methods we used to create fully working exploits that gain remote code execution within the laptop BIOS and their effects on the operating system.

### The Agricultural Data Arms Race: Exploiting a Tractor Load of Vulnerabilities In The Global Food Supply Chain.

20 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Sick Codes

Virtual only presentation

How I hacked the entire American Food Supply Chain over the course of 3 months, assembled a team of hacker strangers, and how we used a "full house" of exploits on almost every aspect of the agriculture industry. See the process in which it happened, the private exploits we used, the vectors we attacked from, and how it could happen again, or be happening right now.

How the ongoing analytics arms race affects everyone, and how Tractor companies have metastasized into Tech companies, with little to no cyber defenses in place. Learn how farms are not like they used to be; telemetry, crop & yield analytics, and more telemetry.

### Your House is My House: Use of Offensive Enclaves In Adversarial Operations

20 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Dimitry "Op\_Nomad" SnezhkovAssociate Director, Protiviti

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

As developers start to rely more on hardware-based memory encryption controls that isolate specific application code and data in memory - secure enclaves, adversaries can use enclaves to successfully coexist on the host and enjoy similar protections.

In this talk we venture into a practical implementation of such an offensive enclave, with the help of Intel SGX enclave technology, supported on a wide variety of processors present in enterprise data-centers and in the cloud.

We discuss how malware can avoid detection in defensively instrumented environments and protect their operational components from processes running at high privilege levels, including the Operating System. We dive deeper into using enclaves in implants and stagers, and discuss the design and implementation of an enclave that is capable of facilitating secure communication and storage of sensitive data in offensive operations. We cover how the enclaves can be built to help secure external communication while resisting system and network inspection efforts and to achieve deployment with minimal dependencies where possible.

Finally, we release the enclave code and a library of offensive enclave primitives as a useful reference for teams that leverage Intel SGX technology or have the hardware platform capable to support such adversarial efforts.

### Racketeer Toolkit. Prototyping Controlled Ransomware Operations

20 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Dimitry "Op\_Nomad" SnezhkovAssociate Director, Protiviti

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Offensive testing in organizations has shown a tremendous value for simulating controlled attacks.
While cyber extortion may be one of the main high ROI end goals for the attacker, surprisingly few tools exist to simulate ransomware operations.

Racketeer is one such tool. It is an offensive agent coupled with a C2 base, built to help teams to prototype and exercise a tightly controlled ransomware campaign.

We walk through the design considerations and implementation of a ransomware implant which emulates logical steps taken to manage connectivity and asset encryption and decryption capabilities. We showcase flexible and actionable ways to prototype components of fully remote ransomware operation including key and data management, as well as data communication that is used in ransomware campaigns.

Racketeer is equipped with practical safeguards for lights out operations, and can address the goals of keeping strict control of data and key management in its deployment, including target containment policy, safe credential management, and implementing operational security in simulated operations.

Racketeer can help gain better optics into IoCs, and is helpful in providing detailed logs that can be used to study the behavior and execution artifacts of a ransomware agent.

### SPARROW: A Novel Covert Communication Scheme Exploiting Broadcast Signals in LTE, 5G & Beyond

45 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Reza Soosahabi Senior R&D Engineer, Keysight Technologies

#### Chuck McAuley Principal security researcher (ATIRC), at Keysight Technologies

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

When researching methods for covert communications in the wireless space, we noticed most hackers are barely looking below the IP layer, and even the wireless guys are focused on creating their own radio (PHY layer) solutions rather than looking at what‚Äôs already available to them. We discovered a sweet spot that takes advantage of MAC layer protocols in LTE and 5G, enabling long range communication using other people‚Äôs networks, GSMA CVD-2021-0045. We can use SPARROW devices almost everywhere in a variety of scenarios, such as data exfiltration and command and control. Despite limited data rates, the new scheme can defeat known covert communication schemes with dedicated PHY in the following ways:

- Maximum Anonymity: SPARROW devices do not authenticate with the host network while operating. This eliminates their exposure to network security and lawful intercept systems as well as spectrum scanners. Utilizing limited resources, they cause very minimal impact on the host network services.

- More Miles per Watt: SPARROW devices can be several miles apart exploiting broadcast power of base stations or non-terrestrial technologies. The range can be further extended by deploying several of them in a geographically sparse mesh network.

- Low Power & Low Complexity: SPARROW devices can utilize existing protocol implementation libraries installed on commodity SDRs. They can operate on batteries or harvest energy from the environment for long durations, just like real sparrows!

### Extension-Land: exploits and rootkits in your browser extensions

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Barak Sternberg Senior Security Researcher

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Browser extensions are installed anywhere, they serve as an integral part of our day-to-day web routine, from AdBlockers to Auto-Translators.
But - do we know what is running inside of them? Do we know what goes deep-down inside their communication routines?
How do they use their internal API‚Äôs? And how do their different JS execution contexts work?

In this session, I will explore these unique internal extension API‚Äôs, hidden attack-surfaces and show how these concepts can be broken & exploited using new ways!
I start showing how an attacker can "jump" from one low-permissions chrome-app/extension to another, hence elevating its permissions.
Then, I will show how to gain full "browser-persistency" inside extensions' background-scripts context.

Chaining it all together, I show how attacker, starting from low permissions chrome-app, gains a fully-armed "extension-rootkit",
a persistent JS-malware running inside of a ‚Äúgood‚Äù extension, along with C&C features, JS injection techniques to any tab/origin, obfuscation-techniques and more.
Eventually, I will present a generic technique, targeting all chrome-users, for taking over any previously installed chrome extension and implant an "extension-rootkit" in it.

### A new class of DNS vulnerabilities affecting many DNS-as-Service platforms

20 minutes | Demo

#### Shir Tamari Head of Research, Wiz (Wiz.io)

#### Ami Luttwak CTO, Wiz

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

We present a novel class of DNS vulnerabilities that affects multiple DNS-as-a-Service (DNSaaS) providers. The vulnerabilities have been proven and successfully exploited on three major cloud providers including AWS Route 53 and may affect many others. Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may allow exfiltration of sensitive information from service customers' corporate networks. The leaked information contains internal and external IP addresses, computer names, and sometimes NTLM hashes. The number of organizations vulnerable to this weakness is shocking. Over a few hours of DNS sniffing, we received sensitive information carried by DNS update queries from ~1M Windows endpoints from around 15,000 potentially vulnerable companies, including 15 Fortune 500 companies. In some organizations, there were more than 20,000 endpoints that actively leaked their information out of the organization. We will review possible mitigations to this problem and solutions for both DNSaaS providers and managed networks.

### UFOs: Misinformation, Disinformation, and the Basic Truth

45 minutes

#### Richard Thieme AKA neuralcowboy author and professional speaker, ThiemeWorks

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

The talk, "UFOs and Government: A Historical Inquiry" given at Def Con 21 has been viewed thousands of times. It was a serious well-documented exploration of the UFO subject based on Thieme's participation in research into the subject with colleagues. The book of that name is the gold standard for historical research into the subject and is in 100+ university libraries.

This update was necessitated by recent UFO incidents and the diverse conversations triggered by them. Contextual understanding is needed to evaluate current reports from pilots and naval personnel, statements from senators and Pentagon personnel, and indeed, all the input from journalists who are often unfamiliar with the field and the real history of documented UFOs over the past 70 years.

Thieme was privileged to participate with scholars and lifelong researchers into the massive trove of reports. We estimate that 95% can be explained by mundane phenomena but the remainder suggest prolonged interaction with our planetary society over a long period. Thieme also knows that when you know you don't know something, don't suggest that you do. Stay with the facts, stay with the data. Sensible conclusions, when we do that, are astonishing enough.

Reality, as Philip K. Dick said, will not go away just because we refuse to believe in it.

### ProxyLogon is Just the Tip of the Iceberg, A New Attack Surface on Microsoft Exchange Server!

45 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Orange Tsai Principal Security Researcher of DEVCORE

Virtual only presentation

Microsoft Exchange Server is an email solution widely deployed within government and enterprises, and it is an integral part of both their daily operations and security. Needless to say, vulnerabilities in Exchange have long been the Holy Grail for attackers, hence our security research on Exchange. Surprisingly, we‚Äôve found not only critical vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, but a whole new attack surface of Exchange.

This new attack surface is based on a significant change in Exchange Server 2013, where the fundamental protocol handler, Client Access Service (CAS), splits into frontend and backend. In this fundamental change of architecture, quite an amount of design debt was incurred, and, even worse, it introduced inconsistencies between contexts, leading us to discover this new attack surface.

To unveil the beauty of this attack surface and our novel exploitation, we‚Äôll start by analyzing this architecture, followed by 7 vulnerabilities that consist of server-side bugs, client-side bugs, and crypto bugs found via this attack surface. In the end, these vulnerabilities are chained into 3 attack vectors that shine in different attack scenarios: ProxyLogon, ProxyShell, and ProxyOracle. These attack vectors enable any unauthenticated attacker to uncover plaintext passwords and even execute arbitrary code on Microsoft Exchange Servers through port 443, which is exposed to the Internet by ~400K Exchange Servers.

This attack surface has its unparalleled impact for a reason: security researchers tend to find vulnerabilities from a certain perspective, such as digging for memory bugs, injections, or logic flaws, but we took a different approach by looking at Exchange from a high-level architectural view and captured this architecture-level attack surface, which yielded multiple vulnerabilities. We hope this brings a new paradigm to vulnerability research and inspires more security researchers to look into Exchange Server. Last but not least, we‚Äôll provide hardening actions to mitigate such types of 0days in Exchange.

### Sneak into buildings with KNXnet/IP

45 minutes | Demo

#### Claire Vacherot Senior Security Auditor @ Orange Cyberdefense

Virtual only presentation

Building Management Systems control a myriad of devices such as lighting, shutters and HVAC. KNX (and by extension KNXnet/IP) is a common protocol used to interact with these BMS. However, the public's understanding and awareness is lacking, and effective tooling is scarce all while the BMS device market keeps on growing.

The ability to craft arbitrary KNXnet/IP frames to interact with these often-insecure BMS provides an excellent opportunity in uncovering vulnerabilities in both the implementation of KNX as well as the protocol itself. From unpacking KNX at a lower level, to using a Python-based protocol crafting framework we developed to interact with KNXnet/IP implementations, in this talk we‚Äôll go on a journey of discovering how BMS that implement KNXnet/IP work as well as how to interact with and fuzz them.

After this talk you could also claim that ‚Äúthe pool on the roof has a leak‚Äù!

### Timeless Timing Attacks

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Tom Van Goethem Researcher, KU Leuven

#### Mathy Vanhoef Postdoctoral Researcher, NYU

Virtual only presentation

25 years ago, the first timing attacks against well-known cryptosystems such as RSA and Diffie-Hellman were introduced. By carefully measuring the execution time of crypto operations, an attacker could infer the bits of the secret. Ever since, timing attacks have frequently resurfaced, leading to many vulnerabilities in various applications and cryptosystems that do not have constant-time execution. As networks became more stable and low-latency, it soon became possible to perform these timing attacks over an Internet connection, potentially putting millions of devices at risk. However, attackers still face the challenge of overcoming the jitter that is incurred on the network path, as it obfuscates the real timing values. Up until now, an adversary would have to collect thousands or millions of measurements to infer a single bit of information.

In this presentation, we introduce a conceptually novel way of performing timing attacks that is completely resilient to network jitter. This means that remote timing attacks can now be executed with a performance and accuracy that is similar as if the attack was performed on the local system. With this technique, which leverages coalescing of network packets and request multiplexing, it is possible to detect timing differences as small as 100ns over any Internet connection. We will elaborate on how this technique can be launched against HTTP/2 webservers, Tor onion services, and EAP-pwd, a popular Wi-Fi authentication method.

### Central bank digital currency, threats and vulnerabilities

45 minutes | Exploit

#### Ian Vitek Security, Sveriges Riksbank (Central bank of Sweden)

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

What are the threats and vulnerabilities of a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC)? The central bank of Sweden has built a prototype of a retail CBDC system and I will run through the procurement requirements and design and point out where a two-tier CBDC need protection against attacks. The prototype is built on Corda Token SDK and I have during tests found reliable ways to exploit weaknesses in the design. The presentation will focus on the vulnerabilities that can crash the service that handles the tokens and permanently lock tokens rendering tokens and digital wallets useless. The presentation will also go into detail how tokens are validated and how information from all earlier transactions is needed for this. With D3.js and HTML5 I will visualize the token history (backchain) and describe how this can be a problem with GDPR and the Swedish bank secrecy regulation.

The presentation will end with a summary of identified threats and weaknesses of a two-tier retail central bank digital currency prototype and how to handle them.
The goal of the presentation is to give the attendees insight of the security implications, challenges depending on the design and where an attack can be carried out and everything that cannot be missed when designing a CBDC.

### Breaking Secure Bootloaders

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Christopher Wade Security Consultant at Pen Test Partners

Virtual only presentation

Bootloaders often use signature verification mechanisms in order to protect a device from executing malicious software. This talk aims to outline actionable weaknesses in modern bootloaders which allow attackers to deploy unsigned code, despite these protection mechanisms.

In the first phase of this talk, we will discuss exploitation of the bootloaders in modern Android smartphones, demonstrating weaknesses which allow for bypassing bootloader unlocking restrictions, decryption of protected user data, and deployment of malicious software to devices using full disk encryption.

In the second phase, we will discuss bootloader weaknesses in the secondary hardware used by smartphones. Using an embedded RF chip as a target, we will demonstrate reverse engineering techniques which identified weaknesses in the signature verification mechanisms of the firmware update protocols used by the bootloader, allowing for deployment of custom firmware to the chip.

### Bundles of Joy: Breaking macOS via Subverted Applications Bundles

45 minutes | Demo

#### Patrick Wardle Founder, Objective-See

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

A recent vulnerability, CVE-2021-30657, neatly bypassed a myriad of foundational macOS security features such as File Quarantine, Gatekeeper, and Notarization. Armed with this capability attackers could (and were!) hacking macOS systems with a simple user (double)-click. Yikes!

In this presentation we‚Äôll dig deep into the bowels of macOS to uncover the root cause of the bug: a subtle logic flaw in the complex and undocumented policy subsystem. Moreover, we‚Äôll highlight the discovery of malware exploiting this bug as an 0day, reversing Apple‚Äôs patch, and discuss novel methods of both detection and prevention.

#### Yuhao Weng Security Researcher of Sangfor

#### Steven Seeley Security Researcher of Qihoo 360

#### Zhiniang Peng Principal Security Researcher at Sangfor

Virtual only presentation

Due current global issues of 2020, organizations have been forced to make changes in how their business model operates and as such, have opened the doors to remote working. Microsoft SharePoint is one of the most popular and trusted Content Management System's (CMS) deployed today. The product is used to share and manage content, internal knowledge with embeded applications to empower teamwork and seamlessly collaborate across an organization for a truly remote experience.

After the efforts of countless talented engineers in Microsoft, SharePoint has been deployed in the Microsoft cloud as part of their office 365 offering. This presentation will analyze the security architecture of SharePoint server and how it differs from other popular CMS products. From an offensive point of view, we will also reveal several attack surfaces and mitigations implemented and how those mitigations can be bypassed. Finally we will disclose several high impact vulnerabilities detailing the discovery and exploitation.

### Defending against nation-state (legal) attack: how to build a privacy-protecting service in the era of ubiquitous surveillance

45 minutes

#### Bill "Woody" Woodcock Chair of the Foundation Council, Quad9

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

US diplomacy and the US District Court of Northern California provide a nearly impenetrable shield against legal assault from other countries for the many tech companies that choose the San Francisco Bay Area as their legal domicile. But US domicile has left companies undefended against ECPA, CALEA, Patriot Act and FISA requests and the gag orders which prevent their disclosure, and the US has little or no statutory protections for users‚Äô privacy. So how do you hack the international legal and diplomatic system to defend the privacy of users of Internet services against nation-state legal attacks? The privacy-and-security-oriented non-profit DNS recursive resolver Quad9 spent four years working the system and learning from prior examples like ProtonMail, and Bill Woodcock, the chair of Quad9‚Äôs Foundation Council, will talk about the threat model Quad9 is defending against, how legal domicile and physical presence interact, and how Quad9 is building a model that other privacy-respecting services can follow. He‚Äôll discuss the critical differences between jurisdictions and legal regimes that Quad9 uncovered in their four-year selection process, and the key and differentiating protections the Swiss government offers that the US and EU governments do not. And if y‚Äôall get tired of that, you might be able to convince him to talk about the injunction Sony Music got against Quad9 in the copyright-troll court in Hamburg and why more privacy may also come at the risk of more censorship.

**Bill Woodcock**

Bill Woodcock is the executive director of Packet Clearing House, the international non-governmental organization that builds and supports critical Internet¬†infrastructure, including Internet exchange points and the core of the domain name system, and he‚Äôs the chairman of the Quad9 Foundation.

### How I use a JSON Deserialization 0day to Steal Your Money On The Blockchain

45 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Hao Xing Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab

#### Zekai Wu Security Researcher from Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab

Virtual only presentation

Fastjson is a widely used open source JSON parser with 23'100 stars on GitHub. As a basic module of countless java web services, it serves hundreds of millions of users. We managed to find a way to bypass many security checks and mitigations by using the inheritance process of some basic classes, and achieve remote code execution successfully. We will disclose these high-risk and universal gadgets for the first time in this talk.

Now, we can control many important websites and affect millions of users. Let's make things more interesting. We found that this fastjson vulnerability affect a multi-billion-dollar blockchain. We designed multiple complex gadgets based on the features of the blockchain, and exquisitely achieved information leakage and pointer hijacking. Putting all these gadgets together, we achieved remote code execution on the blockchain nodes.

However, generally after remote code execution, we seem to have no better exploit method other than the 51% attack, which will lead to serious accounting confusion. After a detailed analysis of the architecture design of the public blockchain, we found a way from RCE to steal the public blockchain users' assets almost without any notification.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published attack case on the realization of covertly stealing user assets after RCE on the public blockchain nodes. We will propose a more covert post penetration exploit method for public blockchain nodes in this talk.

Blockchain is not bulletproof to security vulnerability. We will show you how to use classical web vulnerabilities attack the blockchain and how to steal real money from the decentralized cyber world.

### Glitching RISC-V chips: MTVEC corruption for hardening ISA

45 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Adam 'pi3' Zabrocki Principal System Software Engineer (Offensive Security) at NVIDIA

#### Alex Matrosov

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) provided under open-source licenses that do not require fees to use. ISA is based on established reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. RISC-V has features to increase computer speed, while reducing cost and power use.

Many industry players like Google, IBM, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and Samsung are members of the RISC-V Foundation and have long supported RISC-V development. In 2016, NVIDIA unveiled plans to replace the internal microcontrollers of their graphic cards with next-gen RISC-V-based controllers built for upcoming NVIDIA GPUs.

NVIDIA's Product Security undertook a detailed architectural analysis and research of the RISC-V IP, discovering a potential risk with the ambiguous specification of the Machine Trap Base Address (MTVEC) register. This ambiguity leads to potential fault injection vulnerabilities under physical attack models.

```
Expand description

An IPv4 address.

IPv4 addresses are defined as 32-bit integers in [IETF RFC 791](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791).
They are usually represented as four octets.

See [`IpAddr`](enum.IpAddr.html "enum std::net::IpAddr") for a type encompassing both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

## [√Ç¬ß](#textual-representation)Textual representation

`Ipv4Addr` provides a [`FromStr`](../str/trait.FromStr.html "trait std::str::FromStr") implementation. The four octets are in decimal
notation, divided by `.` (this is called √¢¬Ä¬údot-decimal notation√¢¬Ä¬ù).
Notably, octal numbers (which are indicated with a leading `0`) and hexadecimal numbers (which
are indicated with a leading `0x`) are not allowed per [IETF RFC 6943](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6943#section-3.1.1).

## [√Ç¬ß](#examples)Examples

```
use std::net::Ipv4Addr;

let localhost = Ipv4Addr::new(127, 0, 0, 1);
assert_eq!("127.0.0.1".parse(), Ok(localhost));
assert_eq!(localhost.is_loopback(), true);
assert!("012.004.002.000".parse::<Ipv4Addr>().is_err()); // all octets are in octal
assert!("0000000.0.0.0".parse::<Ipv4Addr>().is_err()); // first octet is a zero in octal
assert!("0xcb.0x0.0x71.0x00".parse::<Ipv4Addr>().is_err()); // all octets are in hex
```

1.80.0 √Ç¬∑ [Source](../../src/core/net/ip_addr.rs.html#486)
#### pub const [BITS](#associatedconstant.BITS): [u32](../primitive.u32.html) = 32u32

The size of an IPv4 address in bits.

##### [√Ç¬ß](#examples-1)Examples

```
use std::net::Ipv4Addr;

assert_eq!(Ipv4Addr::BITS, 32);
```

1.30.0 √Ç¬∑ [Source](../../src/core/net/ip_addr.rs.html#552)
#### pub const [LOCALHOST](#associatedconstant.LOCALHOST): [Ipv4Addr](struct.Ipv4Addr.html "struct std::net::Ipv4Addr")

An IPv4 address with the address pointing to localhost: `127.0.0.1`

##### [√Ç¬ß](#examples-2)Examples

```
use std::net::Ipv4Addr;

let addr = Ipv4Addr::LOCALHOST;
assert_eq!(addr, Ipv4Addr::new(127, 0, 0, 1));
```

1.30.0 √Ç¬∑ [Source](../../src/core/net/ip_addr.rs.html#568)
#### pub const [UNSPECIFIED](#associatedconstant.UNSPECIFIED): [Ipv4Addr](struct.Ipv4Addr.html "struct std::net::Ipv4Addr")

An IPv4 address representing an unspecified address: `0.0.0.0`

This corresponds to the constant `INADDR_ANY` in other languages.

##### [√Ç¬ß](#examples-3)Examples

```
use std::net::Ipv4Addr;

let addr = Ipv4Addr::UNSPECIFIED;
assert_eq!(addr, Ipv4Addr::new(0, 0, 0, 0));
```

1.30.0 √Ç¬∑ [Source](../../src/core/net/ip_addr.rs.html#581)
#### pub const [BROADCAST](#associatedconstant.BROADCAST): [Ipv4Addr](struct.Ipv4Addr.html "struct std::net::Ipv4Addr")

An IPv4 address representing the broadcast address: `255.255.255.255`.

##### [√Ç¬ß](#examples-4)Examples

```
use std::net::Ipv4Addr;

let addr = Ipv4Addr::BROADCAST;
assert_eq!(addr, Ipv4Addr::new(255, 255, 255, 255));
```

1.0.0 (const: 1.32.0) √Ç¬∑ [Source](../../src/core/net/ip_addr.rs.html#472)
#### pub const fn [new](#method.new)(a: [u8](../primitive.u8.html), b: [u8](../primitive.u8.html), c: [u8](../primitive.u8.html), d: [u8](../primitive.u8.html)) -> [Ipv4Addr](struct.Ipv4Addr.html "struct std::net::Ipv4Addr")

Creates a new IPv4 address from four eight-bit octets.

The result will represent the IP address `a`.`b`.`c`.`d`.

##### [√Ç¬ß](#examples-5)Examples

```
use std::net::Ipv4Addr;

let addr = Ipv4Addr::new(127, 0, 0, 1);
```

1.80.0 (const: 1.80.0) √Ç¬∑ [Source](../../src/core/net/ip_addr.rs.html#517)
#### pub const fn [to\_bits](#method.to_bits)(self) -> [u32](../primitive.u32.html)

Converts an IPv4 address into a `u32` representation using native byte order.

Although IPv4 addresses are big-endian, the `u32` value will use the target platform√¢¬Ä¬ôs
native byte order. That is, the `u32` value is an integer representation of the IPv4
address and not an integer interpretation of the IPv4 address√¢¬Ä¬ôs big-endian bitstring. This
means that the `u32` value masked with `0xffffff00` will set the last octet in the address
to 0, regardless of the target platform√¢¬Ä¬ôs endianness.

##### [√Ç¬ß](#examples-6)Examples

```
use std::net::Ipv4Addr;

let addr = Ipv4Addr::new(0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78);
assert_eq!(0x12345678, addr.to_bits());
```

```
use std::net::Ipv4Addr;

let addr = Ipv4Addr::new(0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78);
let addr_bits = addr.to_bits() & 0xffffff00;
assert_eq!(Ipv4Addr::new(0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x00), Ipv4Addr::from_bits(addr_bits));

```

1.80.0 (const: 1.80.0) √Ç¬∑ [Source](../../src/core/net/ip_addr.rs.html#537)
#### pub const fn [from\_bits](#method.from_bits)(bits: [u32](../primitive.u32.html)) -> [Ipv4Addr](struct.Ipv4Addr.html "struct std::net::Ipv4Addr")

Converts a native byte order `u32` into an IPv4 address.

See [`Ipv4Addr::to_bits`](struct.Ipv4Addr.html#method.to_bits "method std::net::Ipv4Addr::to_bits") for an explanation on endianness.

##### [√Ç¬ß](#examples-7)Examples

```
use std::net::Ipv4Addr;

let addr = Ipv4Addr::from_bits(0x12345678);
assert_eq!(Ipv4Addr::new(0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78), addr);
```

1.0.0 (const: 1.50.0) √Ç¬∑ [Source](../../src/core/net/ip_addr.rs.html#597)
#### pub const fn [octets](#method.octets)(&self) -> [[u8](../primitive.u8.html); [4](../primitive.array.html)]

Returns the four eight-bit integers that make up this address.

##### [√Ç¬ß](#examples-8)Examples

```
use std::net::Ipv4Addr;

let addr = Ipv4Addr::new(127, 0, 0, 1);
assert_eq!(addr.octets(), [127, 0, 0, 1]);
```

[Source](../../src/core/net/ip_addr.rs.html#615)
#### pub const fn [from\_octets](#method.from_octets)(octets: [[u8](../primitive.u8.html); [4](../primitive.array.html)]) -> [Ipv4Addr](struct.Ipv4Addr.html "struct std::net::Ipv4Addr")

√∞¬ü¬î¬¨This is a nightly-only experimental API. (`ip_from`¬†[#131360](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/131360))

Creates an `Ipv4Addr` from a four element byte array.

√∞¬ü¬î¬¨This is a nightly-only experimental API. (`ip`¬†[#27709](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27709))

Returns [`true`](../primitive.bool.html "primitive bool") if the address appears to be globally reachable
as specified by the [IANA IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xhtml).

Whether or not an address is practically reachable will depend on your
network configuration. Most IPv4 addresses are globally reachable, unless
they are specifically defined as *not* globally reachable.

Non-exhaustive list of notable addresses that are not globally reachable:

* The [unspecified address](struct.Ipv4Addr.html#associatedconstant.UNSPECIFIED "associated constant std::net::Ipv4Addr::UNSPECIFIED") ([`is_unspecified`](struct.Ipv4Addr.html#method.is_unspecified "method std::net::Ipv4Addr::is_unspecified"))
* Addresses reserved for private use ([`is_private`](struct.Ipv4Addr.html#method.is_private "method std::net::Ipv4Addr::is_private"))
* Addresses in the shared address space ([`is_shared`](struct.Ipv4Addr.html#method.is_shared "method std::net::Ipv4Addr::is_shared"))
* Loopback addresses ([`is_loopback`](struct.Ipv4Addr.html#method.is_loopback "method std::net::Ipv4Addr::is_loopback"))
* Link-local addresses ([`is_link_local`](struct.Ipv4Addr.html#method.is_link_local "method std::net::Ipv4Addr::is_link_local"))
* Addresses reserved for documentation ([`is_documentation`](struct.Ipv4Addr.html#method.is_documentation "method std::net::Ipv4Addr::is_documentation"))
* Addresses reserved for benchmarking ([`is_benchmarking`](struct.Ipv4Addr.html#method.is_benchmarking "method std::net::Ipv4Addr::is_benchmarking"))
* Reserved addresses ([`is_reserved`](struct.Ipv4Addr.html#method.is_reserved "method std::net::Ipv4Addr::is_reserved"))
* The [broadcast address](struct.Ipv4Addr.html#associatedconstant.BROADCAST "associated constant std::net::Ipv4Addr::BROADCAST") ([`is_broadcast`](struct.Ipv4Addr.html#method.is_broadcast "method std::net::Ipv4Addr::is_broadcast"))

For the complete overview of which addresses are globally reachable, see the table at the [IANA IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xhtml).

### Title

CVE-2021-29922 rust standard library ‚Äúnet‚Äù ‚Äì Improper Input Validation of octal literals in rust 1.52.0 std::net and below results in indeterminate SSRF & RFI vulnerabilities.

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-29922

### CVSS Score

9.1

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

### Internal ID

SICK-2021-015

### Vendor

rust-lang

### Product

rust std::net

### Product Versions

1.52.1 and below

### Vulnerability Details

Improper input validation of octal strings in rust-lang standard library ‚Äúnet‚Äù allows unauthenticated remote attackers to perform indeterminate SSRF, RFI, and LFI attacks on many programs that rely on rust-lang std::net. IP address octects are left stripped instead of evaluated as valid IP addresses. For example, an attacker submitting an IP address to a web application that relies on std::net::IpAddr, could cause SSRF via inputting octal input data; An attacker can submit exploitable IP addresses if the octet is 3 digits, with the minimum exploitable octect being 08 (Denial of Service) and the maximum exploitable octet is 099 (Denial of Service). For example, an attacker can submit 010.8.8.8, which is 8.8.8.8 (RFI), yet std::net::IpAddr will evaluate this as 10.8.8.8. Equally, an attacker can input 127.0.026.1 which is really 127.0.22.1 but rust evaluates it as 127.0.26.1.

### Vendor Response

Fixed in rust 1.53: <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83652>

   [3 years ago](https://sick.codes/sick-2021-015/#comment-41673)

   I don‚Äôt see how this can be an error and even get a cve number.

   Today there are two dominant implementations of the ip format ‚Äì IETF and BSD.

   The ‚Äú0 for octal‚Äù format is something BSD proposed but it has not been widely adopted. Ietf on the other hand, say that e.g. 026 is actually 26.

   The general consensus these days is to simply not allow octal format with 0 or hexadecimal format with 0x.

     [3 years ago](https://sick.codes/sick-2021-015/#comment-41674)

     Thanks for your comment, Kim.

     The consensus is there, but the languages allowed it, unfortunately.

     Here are some examples of the impact:

     [CVE-2021-33571](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-33571) ‚Äì In Django 2.2 before 2.2.24, 3.x before 3.1.12, and 3.2 before 3.2.4, URLValidator, validate\_ipv4\_address, and validate\_ipv46\_address do not prohibit leading zero characters in octal literals. This may allow a bypass of access control that is based on IP addresses. (validate\_ipv4\_address and validate\_ipv46\_address are unaffected with Python 3.9.5+..) .

     [CVE-2019-12161](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12161) ‚Äì CVE-2019-12161 WPO WebPageTest 19.04 allows SSRF because ValidateURL in www/runtest.php does not consider octal encoding of IP addresses (such as 0300.0250 as a replacement for 192.168).

     [CVE-2016-4029](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-4029) ‚Äì WordPress before 4.5 does not consider octal and hexadecimal IP address formats when determining an intranet address, which allows remote attackers to bypass an intended SSRF protection mechanism via a crafted address.

     Since we can‚Äôt read everyone‚Äôs codebases, how else other than a CVE advisory would we detail the vulnerability?

# Rust: Multiple Vulnerabilities ‚Äî GLSA **202210-09**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rust, the worst of which could result in denial of service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/rust** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.63.0-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.63.0-r1** |

| Package | **dev-lang/rust-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.64.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.64.0** |

### Background

A systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rust. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Please review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Rust users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/rust-1.63.0-r1"

```

All Rust binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/rust-bin-1.64.0"

```

In addition, users using Portage 3.0.38 or later should ensure that packages with Rust binaries have no vulnerable code statically linked into their binaries by rebuilding the @rust-rebuild set:

```
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose @rust-rebuild

```

### @xu-cheng **[xu-cheng](/xu-cheng)** commented [Mar 29, 2021](#issue-843579496)

In its original specification, leading zero in Ipv4 string is interpreted

as octal literals. So a IP address 0127.0.0.1 actually means 87.0.0.1.

This confusion can lead to many security vulnerabilities. Therefore, in

[IETF RFC 6943](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6943#section-3.1.1), it suggests to disallow octal/hexadecimal format in Ipv4

string all together.

Existing implementation already disallows hexadecimal numbers. This commit

makes Parser reject octal numbers.

Fixes [#83648](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83648).

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Thanks for the pull request, and welcome! The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from [@sfackler](https://github.com/sfackler) (or someone else) soon.  If any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. Due to the way GitHub handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.  Please see [the contribution instructions](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/contributing.html) for more information. |

`[Disallow octal format in Ipv4 string](/rust-lang/rust/pull/83652/commits/974192cd98b3efca8e5cd293f641f561e7487b30 "Disallow octal format in Ipv4 string

In its original specification, leading zero in Ipv4 string is interpreted
as octal literals. So a IP address 0127.0.0.1 actually means 87.0.0.1.

This confusion can lead to many security vulnerabilities. Therefore, in
[IETF RFC 6943], it suggests to disallow octal/hexadecimal format in Ipv4
string all together.

Existing implementation already disallows hexadecimal numbers. This commit
makes Parser reject octal numbers.

Fixes #83648.

`[rust: Update to 1.53.0.](/NetBSD/pkgsrc-wip/commit/63ea8ddab03159cd1533f7003c68e32eac56107e "rust: Update to 1.53.0.

Pkgsrc changes:
 * Bump bootstrap requirements to 1.52.1
 * Adjust patches, adapt to upstream changes, adjust cargo checksums
 * If using an external llvm, require >= 10.0

Upsteream changes:

Version 1.53.0 (2021-06-17)
============================

Language
-----------------------
- [You can now use unicode for identifiers.][83799] This allows
  multilingual identifiers but still doesn't allow glyphs that are
  not considered characters such as `#` (diamond) or `<U+1F980>`
  (crab). More specifically you can now use any identifier that
  matches the UAX #31 \"Unicode Identifier and Pattern Syntax\" standard. This
  is the same standard as languages like Python, however Rust uses NFC
  normalization which may be different from other languages.
- [You can now specify \"or patterns\" inside pattern matches.][79278]
  Previously you could only use `|` (OR) on complete patterns. E.g.
  ```rust
  let x = Some(2u8);
  // Before
  matches!(x, Some(1) | Some(2));
  // Now
  matches!(x, Some(1 | 2));
  ```
- [Added the `:pat_param` `macro_rules!` matcher.][83386] This matcher
  has the same semantics as the `:pat` matcher. This is to allow `:pat`
  to change semantics to being a pattern fragment in a future edition.

Compiler
-----------------------
- [Updated the minimum external LLVM version to LLVM 10.][83387]
- [Added Tier 3\* support for the `wasm64-unknown-unknown` target.][80525]
- [Improved debuginfo for closures and async functions on Windows MSVC.][83941]

\* Refer to Rust's [platform support page][platform-support-doc] for more
information on Rust's tiered platform support.

Libraries
-----------------------
- [Abort messages will now forward to `android_set_abort_message` on
  Android platforms when available.][81469]
- [`slice::IterMut<'_, T>` now implements `AsRef<[T]>`][82771]
- [Arrays of any length now implement `IntoIterator`.][84147]
  Currently calling `.into_iter()` as a method on an array will
  return `impl Iterator<Item=&T>`, but this may change in a
  future edition to change `Item` to `T`. Calling `IntoIterator::into_iter`
  directly on arrays will provide `impl Iterator<Item=T>` as expected.
- [`leading_zeros`, and `trailing_zeros` are now available on all
  `NonZero` integer types.][84082]
- [`{f32, f64}::from_str` now parse and print special values
  (`NaN`, `-0`) according to IEEE RFC 754.][78618]
- [You can now index into slices using `(Bound<usize>, Bound<usize>)`.][77704]
- [Add the `BITS` associated constant to all numeric types.][82565]

- [`cmp::min_by_key`]
- [`cmp::min_by`]
- [`f32::is_subnormal`]
- [`f64::is_subnormal`]

Cargo
-----------------------
- [Cargo now supports git repositories where the default `HEAD` branch is not
  \"master\".][cargo/9392] This also includes a switch to the version
  3 `Cargo.lock` format which can handle default branches correctly.
- [macOS targets now default to `unpacked` split-debuginfo.][cargo/9298]
- [The `authors` field is no longer included in `Cargo.toml` for new
  projects.][cargo/9282]

Rustdoc
-----------------------
- [Added the `rustdoc::bare_urls` lint that warns when you have URLs
  without hyperlinks.][81764]

Compatibility Notes
-------------------
- [Implement token-based handling of attributes during expansion][82608]
- [`Ipv4::from_str` will now reject octal format IP addresses in addition
  to rejecting hexadecimal IP addresses.][83652] The octal format can lead
  to confusion and potential security vulnerabilities and [is no
  longer recommended][ietf6943].

Internal Only
-------------
These changes provide no direct user facing benefits, but represent significant
improvements to the internals and overall performance of rustc and
related tools.

- [Rework the `std::sys::windows::alloc` implementation.][83065]
- [rustdoc: Don't enter an infer_ctxt in get_blanket_impls for
  impls that aren't blanket impls.][82864]
- [rustdoc: Only look at blanket impls in `get_blanket_impls`][83681]
- [Rework rustdoc const type][82873]

`[63ea8dd](/NetBSD/pkgsrc-wip/commit/63ea8ddab03159cd1533f7003c68e32eac56107e)`

```
Pkgsrc changes:
 * Bump bootstrap requirements to 1.52.1
 * Adjust patches, adapt to upstream changes, adjust cargo checksums
 * If using an external llvm, require >= 10.0

Upsteream changes:

Version 1.53.0 (2021-06-17)
============================

Language
-----------------------
- [You can now use unicode for identifiers.][83799] This allows
  multilingual identifiers but still doesn't allow glyphs that are
  not considered characters such as `#` (diamond) or `<U+1F980>`
  (crab). More specifically you can now use any identifier that
  matches the UAX #31 "Unicode Identifier and Pattern Syntax" standard. This
  is the same standard as languages like Python, however Rust uses NFC
  normalization which may be different from other languages.
- [You can now specify "or patterns" inside pattern matches.][79278]
  Previously you could only use `|` (OR) on complete patterns. E.g.
  ```rust
  let x = Some(2u8);
  // Before
  matches!(x, Some(1) | Some(2));
  // Now
  matches!(x, Some(1 | 2));
  ```
- [Added the `:pat_param` `macro_rules!` matcher.][83386] This matcher
  has the same semantics as the `:pat` matcher. This is to allow `:pat`
  to change semantics to being a pattern fragment in a future edition.

Compiler
-----------------------
- [Updated the minimum external LLVM version to LLVM 10.][83387]
- [Added Tier 3\* support for the `wasm64-unknown-unknown` target.][80525]
- [Improved debuginfo for closures and async functions on Windows MSVC.][83941]

\* Refer to Rust's [platform support page][platform-support-doc] for more
information on Rust's tiered platform support.

Libraries
-----------------------
- [Abort messages will now forward to `android_set_abort_message` on
  Android platforms when available.][81469]
- [`slice::IterMut<'_, T>` now implements `AsRef<[T]>`][82771]
- [Arrays of any length now implement `IntoIterator`.][84147]
  Currently calling `.into_iter()` as a method on an array will
  return `impl Iterator<Item=&T>`, but this may change in a
  future edition to change `Item` to `T`. Calling `IntoIterator::into_iter`
  directly on arrays will provide `impl Iterator<Item=T>` as expected.
- [`leading_zeros`, and `trailing_zeros` are now available on all
  `NonZero` integer types.][84082]
- [`{f32, f64}::from_str` now parse and print special values
  (`NaN`, `-0`) according to IEEE RFC 754.][78618]
- [You can now index into slices using `(Bound<usize>, Bound<usize>)`.][77704]
- [Add the `BITS` associated constant to all numeric types.][82565]

Cargo
-----------------------
- [Cargo now supports git repositories where the default `HEAD` branch is not
  "master".][cargo/9392] This also includes a switch to the version
  3 `Cargo.lock` format which can handle default branches correctly.
- [macOS targets now default to `unpacked` split-debuginfo.][cargo/9298]
- [The `authors` field is no longer included in `Cargo.toml` for new
  projects.][cargo/9282]

Rustdoc
-----------------------
- [Added the `rustdoc::bare_urls` lint that warns when you have URLs
  without hyperlinks.][81764]

Compatibility Notes
-------------------
- [Implement token-based handling of attributes during expansion][82608]
- [`Ipv4::from_str` will now reject octal format IP addresses in addition
  to rejecting hexadecimal IP addresses.][83652] The octal format can lead
  to confusion and potential security vulnerabilities and [is no
  longer recommended][ietf6943].

Internal Only
-------------
These changes provide no direct user facing benefits, but represent significant
improvements to the internals and overall performance of rustc and
related tools.

- [Rework the `std::sys::windows::alloc` implementation.][83065]
- [rustdoc: Don't enter an infer_ctxt in get_blanket_impls for
  impls that aren't blanket impls.][82864]
- [rustdoc: Only look at blanket impls in `get_blanket_impls`][83681]
- [Rework rustdoc const type][82873]

### Title

CVE-2021-29922 rust standard library "net" - Improper Input Validation of octal literals in rust 1.52.0 std::net and below results in indeterminate SSRF & RFI vulnerabilities.

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-29922

### CVSS Score

9.1 CRITICAL

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

### Internal ID

SICK-2021-015

### Vendor

rust-lang

### Product

rust std::net

### Product Versions

1.52.1 and below

### Vulnerability Details

Improper input validation of octal strings in rust-lang standard library "net" allows unauthenticated remote attackers to perform indeterminate SSRF, RFI, and LFI attacks on many programs that rely on rust-lang std::net. IP address octects are left stripped instead of evaluated as valid IP addresses. For example, an attacker submitting an IP address to a web application that relies on std::net::IpAddr, could cause SSRF via inputting octal input data; An attacker can submit exploitable IP addresses if the octet is 3 digits, with the minimum exploitable octect being 08 (Denial of Service) and the maximum exploitable octet is 099 (Denial of Service). For example, an attacker can submit 010.8.8.8, which is 8.8.8.8 (RFI), yet std::net::IpAddr will evaluate this as 10.8.8.8. Equally, an attacker can input 127.0.026.1 which is really 127.0.22.1 but rust evaluates it as 127.0.26.1.

### Vendor Response

Fixed in rust 1.53: [rust-lang/rust#83652](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83652)
