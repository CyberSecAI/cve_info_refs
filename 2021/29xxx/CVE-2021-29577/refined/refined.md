The content is related to CVE-2021-29577.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing check in the `tf.raw_ops.AvgPool3DGrad` implementation. The implementation assumes that the `orig_input_shape` and `grad` tensors have similar first and last dimensions but does not validate this assumption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the `AvgPool3DGrad` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A heap buffer overflow can occur if the `orig_input_shape` and `grad` tensors do not have matching first and last dimensions. This could lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can craft a specific input to `tf.raw_ops.AvgPool3DGrad` with mismatched `orig_input_shape` and `grad` tensors to trigger the heap buffer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to provide input tensors to the `tf.raw_ops.AvgPool3DGrad` function.
