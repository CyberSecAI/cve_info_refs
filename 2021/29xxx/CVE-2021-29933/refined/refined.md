- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `insert_many` function used `ptr::copy` to move items in a vector, which duplicated ownership. If the iterator used to insert new items panicked, the vector could drop the same elements twice.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Double-free vulnerability due to duplicated ownership of elements.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A double-free can lead to memory corruption, and potentially denial of service due to program termination. High availability impact is noted.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered if the iterator's `.next()` method panics during the insertion process. The attack vector is categorized as "Network" which might be a generalization to cover any trigger including remote ones since the vulnerability occurs in application logic, not network protocol processing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No privileges or user interaction are required to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker needs to supply an iterator which will panic when `.next()` is called by the affected function.
