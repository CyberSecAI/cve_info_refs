- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw in the logging mechanism of the Integration Server component within IBM App Connect Enterprise Certified Container, specifically when running Designer flows, results in credential information being written to log files inside the container.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Sensitive credential information is unintentionally included in log files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A privileged user could gain access to sensitive information from the log files, such as credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: A privileged user with access to the container's internal log files can read the sensitive information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have privileged access to the container where IBM App Connect Enterprise Certified Container is running, to access the log files.
