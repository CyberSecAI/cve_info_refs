- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An attacker gaining service access to the FSP (Flexible Service Processor) can locate and decrypt data in the Platform KeyStore through a series of service procedures.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure handling of data within the Platform KeyStore, allowing decryption of sensitive information if an attacker gains service access to the FSP.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Decryption of data stored within the Platform KeyStore.
- **Attack vectors**: Gaining service access to the FSP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to gain service access to the Flexible Service Processor (FSP).
