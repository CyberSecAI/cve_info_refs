Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29590:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds (OOB) read in the TFLite implementation of the `Minimum` and `Maximum` operators. The broadcasting implementation indexes into input tensors without proper validation, specifically when either of the input tensors is empty.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap OOB Read:** The code directly accesses memory locations using calculated indices without ensuring they fall within the bounds of the allocated input tensor buffers.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The broadcasting logic does not account for the case where either of the input tensors is empty.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read arbitrary data from the heap, which might contain sensitive information.
- **Application Crash:**  OOB read can lead to a crash of the application due to memory access violations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the execution of the `Minimum` and `Maximum` TFLite operators.
- To trigger the vulnerability, a malicious actor needs to craft a TFLite model where one of the input tensors to the `Minimum` or `Maximum` operator is empty.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a TFLite model to the application or system using the vulnerable TFLite implementation.
- No special privileges required.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix for the vulnerability is provided in the commit [953f28dca13c92839ba389c055587cfe6c723578](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/953f28dca13c92839ba389c055587cfe6c723578).
