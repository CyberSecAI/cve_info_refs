Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-29434

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of server-side validation of URLs within Wagtail's rich text fields. Specifically, when a user saves content with links in the admin interface, the system doesn't verify if the URL protocol is valid.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Improper Input Validation:**  The system fails to sanitize and validate URL inputs, allowing malicious URLs to be saved.
*   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):**  The lack of URL validation allows for the injection of `javascript:` URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A malicious user with access to the Wagtail admin interface could inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the content of a website.
*   The injected JavaScript can execute within the browsers of other users who view the affected page.
*   This can lead to a variety of attacks such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   A malicious actor must have access to the Wagtail admin interface.
*   The attacker crafts a POST request to save a rich text field containing a link with a malicious `javascript:` URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the Wagtail admin panel.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is not exploitable by ordinary site visitors, it requires access to the admin panel.
*   Patches are available in Wagtail versions 2.11.7 and 2.12.4.
*   A workaround is provided that can be implemented as a patch in the `wagtail_hooks.py` module.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" severity.
*   The reported CWE is CWE-79, which is related to cross-site scripting.
