# Improper validation of URLs ('Cross-site Scripting') in Wagtail rich text fields

Moderate

[gasman](/gasman)
published
GHSA-wq5h-f9p5-q7fx
Apr 19, 2021

## Package

pip

wagtail
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<2.11.6, 2.12-2.12.3

## Patched versions

2.11.7, 2.12.4

## Description

### Impact

When saving the contents of a rich text field in the admin interface, Wagtail does not apply server-side checks to ensure that link URLs use a valid protocol. A malicious user with access to the admin interface could thus craft a POST request to publish content with `javascript:` URLs containing arbitrary code. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin.

### Patches

Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 2.11.7 (for the LTS 2.11 branch) and Wagtail 2.12.4 (for the current 2.12 branch).

### Workarounds

For sites that cannot easily upgrade to a current supported version, the vulnerability can be patched by adding the following code to a `wagtail_hooks.py` module in any installed app:

```
from draftjs_exporter.dom import DOM
from wagtail.admin.rich_text.converters.html_to_contentstate import ExternalLinkElementHandler, PageLinkElementHandler
from wagtail.core import hooks
from wagtail.core.whitelist import check_url

def link_entity(props):
    id_ = props.get('id')
    link_props = {}

    if id_ is not None:
        link_props['linktype'] = 'page'
        link_props['id'] = id_
    else:
        link_props['href'] = check_url(props.get('url'))

    return DOM.create_element('a', link_props, props['children'])

@hooks.register('register_rich_text_features', order=1)
def register_link(features):
    features.register_converter_rule('contentstate', 'link', {
        'from_database_format': {
            'a[href]': ExternalLinkElementHandler('LINK'),
            'a[linktype="page"]': PageLinkElementHandler('LINK'),
        },
        'to_database_format': {
            'entity_decorators': {'LINK': link_entity}
        }
    })
```
