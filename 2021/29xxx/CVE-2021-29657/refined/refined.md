Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2021-29657 vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the Linux Kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) implementation, specifically within the nSVM (nested Secure Virtual Machine) component.
*   The issue arises due to a race condition in how nested VMCB (Virtual Machine Control Block) controls are loaded and checked.
*   Specifically, the control fields were not loaded before they were checked, potentially leading to the hypervisor not properly intercepting VMRUN instructions, and the nested guest accessing MSR permission bitmap.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Time-of-check, time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition:** The vulnerability stems from a TOCTOU race where the checks on VMCB controls happen before the controls are loaded, which can cause a discrepancy between what is checked and what is eventually used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A malicious nested guest (virtual machine) could potentially influence the host kernel behavior.
*   **Unintended hypervisor behavior:** It can lead to a state where the VMRUN intercept is processed by the host instead of the nested hypervisor.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Nested Virtualization:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a malicious guest OS running inside a virtual machine that is itself running on a hypervisor with nested virtualization enabled (SVM).
*   **Host System:** The vulnerability resides in the host kernel. Exploitation can result in a compromised host.
*   **VMRUN instruction:** This instruction is specific to AMD's SVM technology and is related to executing code within a virtualized environment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Nested Guest Control:** The attacker must have control over a guest operating system running within a virtual machine on a vulnerable hypervisor.
*   **Nested Virtualization:** The hypervisor must have nested virtualization enabled.
*   **Exploitation Complexity:** Exploiting this vulnerability likely requires a deep understanding of the KVM, SVM and VMCB implementation in the Linux Kernel.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected NetApp Products:** Several NetApp products are listed as affected due to incorporating a vulnerable Linux Kernel, particularly in their Baseboard Management Controllers (BMCs). These include:
    *   NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault)
    *   NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H300S/H500S/H700S/H410S
    *   NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H410C
    *    NetApp SolidFire Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)

*  **Products Not Affected:** A long list of NetApp products is mentioned as not affected, which include storage controllers, management tools, SDKs and other software.

*   **Remediation:** NetApp states that no patches are available for affected products and provides end-of-life (EOA) announcements for each. This implies that these products may not be supported or fixed.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 7.4 (HIGH) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, which means that it has a high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability but requires a high attack complexity and does not need any user interaction nor privilege for exploitation.

*  **Kernel commit:** The Linux kernel commit that fixes the vulnerability is [a58d9166a756a0f4a6618e4f593232593d6df134](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=a58d9166a756a0f4a6618e4f593232593d6df134) which is included in Linux Kernel version 5.11.12
