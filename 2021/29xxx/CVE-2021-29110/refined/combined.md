**Additional Notes:**

This patch is highly recommended and encouraged for all customers running on currently supported versions of ArcGIS Enterprise (10.6, 10.6.1, 10.7.1, 10.8, 10.8.1).

As a new approach to help streamline the patching process for both customers and Esri, this patch will be a prerequisite for future patches of the Portal for ArcGIS component of ArcGIS Enterprise. As a consequence, **this patch cannot be uninstalled once it has been applied to Windows systems**. While the patch can be uninstalled on Linux systems, it will be required to install it again in such cases where future patches are desired.

 This also means that this patch is cumulative of all hot fixes and patches previously built and released for the individual versions. Refer to the Issues Addressed section of the patch page for details on accumulated fixes as the set of fixes is not identical when comparing across versions.

Older patches that have been made obsolete by this new patch will no longer show up in the [patch notification tool](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/administer/windows/check-for-software-patches-and-updates.htm). Some older Portal for ArcGIS patches will still be listed in the cases where they are not accumulated into this one and are thus still required to be installed separately.
