- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw in IBM Jazz for Service Management.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI, potentially altering intended functionality and leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attack vector is through the Web UI of IBM Jazz for Service Management where a malicious user can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which is then stored and executed within the context of other users' sessions when they access the affected content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's database, which requires some level of access to the system, possibly through a compromised account or a related vulnerability that allows writing to the data store.
