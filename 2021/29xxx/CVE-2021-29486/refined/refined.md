Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-29486:

**Root Cause:**

- The `cumulative-distribution-function` library did not properly validate input data, specifically the data array used to calculate the cumulative distribution. It failed to distinguish between numeric data (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`) and string data that looks like numbers (e.g., `["1", "2", "3"]`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Improper Input Validation:** The library did not check if the input data array consisted of numbers.
- **Infinite Loop:** When provided with an array of strings instead of numbers, the internal bisection algorithm used in the library could enter an infinite loop due to how JavaScript handles string comparisons and arithmetic.
- **Lack of Error Handling:** The library did not have proper error handling for invalid input data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The infinite loop caused by invalid input could lead to a denial-of-service condition for applications using the library.
  - **Server-side:** A Node.js server application using this library with invalid input data could crash, affecting other users of the server and potentially requiring a reboot.
  - **Client-side:** A browser application using this library with invalid data could crash or lock up the browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Input Data:** An attacker could supply malformed data (an array of strings instead of numbers) to the library.
- **Data Type Change:** A data source providing data to be analyzed by the library could unexpectedly change the data type from `Array[number]` to `Array[string]`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the data input to the `cumulative-distribution-function` library. This could be achieved in various ways depending on the application, such as:
  - Directly providing input data.
  - Manipulating data from a data source that is consumed by the application.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was addressed in version 2.0.0 of the library by:
  - Adding checks to ensure input data is of type number and finite.
  - Throwing a `TypeError` when invalid data (non-numeric data, missing/empty arrays) is provided.
- A loop limit was added in version 2.1. This prevents the bisection algorithm from looping endlessly, even if the data is changed after the initial validation.
- The fix includes tests for various types of invalid data (strings, NaN, Infinity, missing or empty data) to prevent similar issues.
