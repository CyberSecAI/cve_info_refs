| Hi,  thanks you for providing this package. Given a specific data set we found that the function is stuck in a while loop. This can be reproduced reliably through the following example:  ``` const xs = [ "-630", "-602", "-663", "-715", "-588", "-630", "-680", "-570", "-655", "-636", "-620", "-680", "-551", "-528", "-829", "-528", "-642", "-861", "-642", "-829", "-801", "-515", "-708", "-680", "-630", "-663", "-655", "-588", "-776", "-620", "-680", "-843", "-630", "-769", "-663", "-811", "-636", "-751", "-500", "-783", "-708", "-723", "-702", "-671", "-690", "-751", "-611", "-655", "-762", "-756", "-595", "-655", "-702", "-636", "-740", "-490", "-791", "-731", "-636", "-680", "-723", "-731", "-570", "-655", "-642", "-671", "-620", "-696", "-740", "-740", "-690", "-655", "-690", "-829", "-630", "-680", "-708", "-769", "-671", "-636", "-663", "-551", "-801", "-611", "-769", "-801", "-822", "-663", "-776", "-671", "-843", "-630", "-791", "-751", "-680", "-731", "-696", "-690", "-723", "-630", "-791", "-762", "-570", "-731", "-648", "-708", "-811", "-791", "-731", "-811", "-680", "-715", "-731", "-791", "-542", "-611", "-751", "-762", "-740", "-871", "-776", "-740", "-620", "-702", "-769", "-680", "-663", "-671", "-852", "-696", "-630", "-791", "-500", "-611", "-715", "-776", "-648", "-723", "-671", "-801", "-671", "-756", "-751", "-636", "-680", "-663", "-582", "-723", "-756", "-690", "-776", "-582", "-769", "-829", "-811", "-595", "-769", "-671", "-791", "-756", "-769", "-655", "-702", "-769", "-731", "-836", "-671", "-560", "-762", "-723", "-811", "-551", "-801", "-671", "-723", "-801", "-648", "-731", "-769", "-756", "-611", "-801", "-648", "-482", "-636", "-791", "-791", "-769", "-570", "-602", "-811", "-636", "-861", "-861", "-461", "-648", "-690", "-620", "-655", "-663", "-762", "-655", "-811", "-648", "-715", "-756", "-731", "-751", "-776", "-762", "-740", "-756", "-731", "-769", "-751", "-769", "-740", "-791", "-751", "-791", "-751", "-756", "-776", "-756", "-756", "-751", "-783", "-751", "-756", "-756", "-762", "-762", "-582", "-783", "-680", "-811", "-648", "-642", "-690", "-836", "-588", "-769", "-551", "-723", "-811", "-570", "-723", "-690", "-696", "-588", "-636", "-535", "-648", "-690", "-751", "-551", "-588", "-769", "-822", "-642", "-630"]   const cdf = require('cumulative-distribution-function'); const func = cdf(xs) console.log("hello") console.log(func(-791)) console.log("done")  ```  I hope you find this useful. |

| Thanks for this. I confirmed the issue.  The input needs to be numeric and finite -- not strings.  Finding the cdf quickly involves bisection and code like this:     [cumulative-distribution-function/index.js](https://github.com/DrPaulBrewer/cumulative-distribution-function/blob/afaf917e5d26ecbb6413694f85b8bbdb1c9034ad/index.js#L35)  Line 35 in [afaf917](/DrPaulBrewer/cumulative-distribution-function/commit/afaf917e5d26ecbb6413694f85b8bbdb1c9034ad)   |  | mid = Math.floor((left+right)/2); | | --- | --- |      As you may know, in JS "2"+"2" === "22" and with numbers it is 4 (on most days).  Extracting the numeric data seems to fix your example and yields `0.1609...`  ``` ... const xs_numeric = xs.map((v)=>(+v)).filter((v)=>(isFinite(v)); const func = cdf(xs_numeric) ...  ``` |

| Notes to self:  A fix should aim to eliminate the use of improper data as a denial-of-service attack against an app using the cdf() functionality.     [cumulative-distribution-function/index.js](https://github.com/DrPaulBrewer/cumulative-distribution-function/blob/7c5d9513fa489d8003124d3b3579228a344cad16/index.js#L13)  Line 13 in [7c5d951](/DrPaulBrewer/cumulative-distribution-function/commit/7c5d9513fa489d8003124d3b3579228a344cad16)   |  | sorted = data.slice().sort(function(a,b){ return +a-b; }); | | --- | --- |      It is already doing a copy of the data array internally; that copy already costs time and memory.  Converting numeric strings and eliminating non-numeric data in a copy of the data is probably not a terrible idea. |

# Improper Input Validation and Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop') in cumulative-distribution-function

High

[DrPaulBrewer](/DrPaulBrewer)
published
GHSA-58qp-5328-v7mh
Apr 30, 2021

## Package

npm

cumulative-distribution-function
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<=1.0.3

## Patched versions

2.0.0

## Description

### Impact

* Apps using this library on improper data may crash or go into an infinite-loop
* In the case of a nodejs server-app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, the nodejs server may crash. This may affect other users of this server and/or require the server to be rebooted for proper operation.
* In the case of a browser app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, that browser may crash or lock up.

A flaw enabling an infinite-loop was discovered in the code for evaluating the cumulative-distribution-function

of input data. Although the documentation explains that numeric data is required, some users may confuse an array

of strings like ["1","2","3","4","5"] for numeric data [1,2,3,4,5] when it is in fact string data. An infinite loop is possible when the

cumulative-distribution-function is evaluated for a given point when the input data is string data rather than type `number`.

This vulnerability enables an infinite-cpu-loop denial-of-service-attack on any app using npm:cumulative-distribution-function v1.0.3 or earlier if the attacker can supply malformed data to the library. The vulnerability could also manifest if a data source to

be analyzed changes data type from Arrays of number (proper) to Arrays of string (invalid, but undetected by earlier version of the library).

### Patches

Users should upgrade to at least v2.0.0, or the latest version.

Tests for several types of invalid data have been created, and version 2.0.0 has been tested to reject this invalid data by

throwing a `TypeError()` instead of processing it. Developers using this library may wish to adjust their app's code slightly to better tolerate or handle this TypeError. Apps performing proper numeric data validation before sending data to this library should be mostly unaffected by this patch.

### Workarounds

The vulnerability can be mitigated in older versions by ensuring that only finite numeric data of type `Array[number]` or `number` is passed to `cumulative-distribution-function` and its `f(x)` function, respectively.

Calculates statistical cumulative distribution function from data array of x values.

## Installation

`npm i cumulative-distribution-function -S`

## Dependencies

None. Suitable for usage on nodejs or on the browser, via browserify.

## Initialization

`const cdf = require('cumulative-distribution-function');`

## Usage

Pass a *number* data array as input. Do not pass strings that look like numbers. Invalid data may throw a `TypeError`

`f = cdf(data)` returns a **function** `f`, the [empirical cumulative distribution function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_distribution_function),
a step function `f(x)` that counts the proportion of data less than or equal to the number input x.

The function returned by cdf(data) takes a number x and returns the proportion of values less than or equal to x.

## New for v2.0: Passing string data (e.g.`"42"`) or other invalid, missing or empty data instead of numbers will throw a TypeError.

Pass clean data. Convert and clean up your data with something like:

```
const clean_data = raw_data
                    .map((v)=>(+v))
                    .filter((v)=>(isFinite(v)));

```

where the map function will convert stringified numbers (e.g. '123') to numbers;
and the filter function will remove NaN's, +Infinity, and -Infinity.

The simple map/filter conversion above won't work for everybody.

For instance, `+v` converts `''` or `null` to `0` which is kept, and `undefined` to `NaN` which is filtered out.

## New for v2.1: Bisection loop limit

`Error("cdf function exceeded 40 bisection iterations, aborting bisection loop")`

The returned function `f` from `f = cdf(data)` will throw the above error instead of loop endlessly on invalid data. This helps in case an "attacker"
(or simply poor code) changes the `xs` data array accessible at `f.xs()` to be string data or other invalid data. The limit of 40
bisections implies a data array size limit of roughly 2^40 or 10^12 entries. This limit is beyond 2021 browser and nodejs capabilities but is short
enough to "fail quickly" in the case of an unusual failure in the bisection exit conditions.

## Example

```
var mydata = [13,2,5,3,23,7,11,13,19,23];
var mycdf  = cdf(mydata); // cdf(mydata) returns a **function**, so mycdf is a **function**
mycdf(-5)  // 0.0 because all mydata are greater than -5
mycdf(2)  // 0.1 because 1 of 10 mydata are less than or equal to 2
mycdf(3)  // 0.2 because 2 of 10 mydata are less than or equal to 3
mycdf(13) // 0.7 because 7 of 10 mydata are less than or equal to 13
mycdf(19) // 0.8 because 8 of 10 mydata are less than or equal to 19
mycdf(20) // 0.8 because 8 of 10 mydata are less than or equal to 20
mycdf(25) // 1.0 because all mydata are less than or equal to 25
mycdf.xs() // returns [2,    3,  5,  7, 11, 13, 19, 23] from sorted, unique mydata
mycdf.ps() // returns [0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.7,0.8,1.0] from corresponding cumulative proportions

```
## Missing or Empty Data

Will throw TypeError

## Tests

Use mocha framework.
