Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-29703

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a specially crafted `SELECT` statement that, when executed, causes the IBM Db2 server to terminate abnormally, leading to a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core weakness is an exploitable flaw within the handling of specific `SELECT` statements in IBM Db2, leading to abnormal server termination. This suggests a lack of proper input validation or error handling in the query processing logic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact of successful exploitation is a denial of service (DoS). The server termination disrupts normal operations, making the database unavailable until restarted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the execution of a specifically crafted `SELECT` statement against a vulnerable IBM Db2 instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary `SELECT` statements against the database. This could be achieved through:
    -  Direct access to the database server.
    -  SQL injection vulnerabilities in applications using the database.
    -  Compromised database user accounts with the required permissions.
    - Network access to the vulnerable service

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- All fix pack levels of IBM Db2 V10.1, V10.5, V11.1, and V11.5 server editions on all platforms are affected.
- NetApp products that incorporate vulnerable versions of IBM DB2 are also affected.

**Mitigation:**
- Apply the special builds containing the interim fix for this issue from Fix Central. These special builds are available based on the most recent fixpack level for each impacted release: V10.1 FP6, V10.5 FP11, V11.1.4 FP6, and V11.5.5. They can be applied to any affected fixpack level of the appropriate release to remediate this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The NetApp advisory indicates that there was public discussion about this vulnerability.

This information provides a good understanding of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-29703.
