# DNS rebinding in pupnp

High

[mrjimenez](/mrjimenez)
published
GHSA-6hqq-w3jq-9fhg
Apr 20, 2021

## Package

pupnp

## Affected versions

all

## Patched versions

1.14.6

## Description

The server part of pupnp (libupnp) appears to be vulnerable to DNS-rebinding

attacks because it does not check the value of the `Host` header.

### Impact

A remote web server can exploit this vulnerability to trick the user

browser into triggering actions on the local UPnP services

implemented using this library. Depending on the affected service, this could be used for data exfitlration, data tempering, etc.

For example, this can be used to exfiltrate the content

of the media files exposed by a UPnP AV MediaServer server.

Moreover, it should be possible to delete or upload files

if this is enabled in the server configuration.

### Patches

This will be fixed in 1.14.6 and later.

### Workarounds

This can be mitigated by using DNS revolvers which block DNS-rebinding attacks.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory email us at pupnp.github@gmail.com with the word `security` in the subject.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-29462

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
