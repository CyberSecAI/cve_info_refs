Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29585:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a missing check for a zero value in the `stride` argument within the `ComputeOutSize` function, which is used to compute the output size after padding in TensorFlow Lite (TFLite). This function performs a division operation using the `stride` value, leading to a division-by-zero error if the `stride` is zero.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Division by Zero:** The core vulnerability is the potential division by zero within the `ComputeOutSize` function due to the lack of input validation on the `stride` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Crash:** A crafted TFLite model with a `stride` of 0 when calling `ComputeOutSize` will lead to a crash due to the division-by-zero error. This could cause denial of service.
- The vulnerability has a "Low" severity rating.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted TFLite Model:** An attacker can create a malicious TFLite model where the padding calculation in `ComputeOutSize` uses a `stride` of 0, thus triggering the vulnerability during model execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs the ability to create or modify a TFLite model.
- No specific position or privilege is required, as this is a model-based vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The patch introduced a check `if (stride == 0) return 0;` to avoid the division by zero.
- The vulnerability was reported by the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
- The fix was included in TensorFlow versions 2.5.0, 2.4.2, 2.3.3, 2.2.3, and 2.1.4
