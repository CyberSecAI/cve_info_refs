# Division by zero in padding computation in TFLite

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-mv78-g7wq-mhp4
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow-lite
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

The TFLite computation for size of output after padding, [`ComputeOutSize`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0c9692ae7b1671c983569e5d3de5565843d500cf/tensorflow/lite/kernels/padding.h#L43-L55), does not check that the `stride` argument is not 0 before doing the division.

```
inline int ComputeOutSize(TfLitePadding padding, int image_size,
                          int filter_size, int stride, int dilation_rate = 1) {
  int effective_filter_size = (filter_size - 1) * dilation_rate + 1;
  switch (padding) {
    case kTfLitePaddingSame:
      return (image_size + stride - 1) / stride;
    case kTfLitePaddingValid:
      return (image_size + stride - effective_filter_size) / stride;
    default:
      return 0;
  }
}
```

Users can craft special models such that `ComputeOutSize` is called with `stride` set to 0.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [49847ae69a4e1a97ae7f2db5e217c77721e37948](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/49847ae69a4e1a97ae7f2db5e217c77721e37948).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution
