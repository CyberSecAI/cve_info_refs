- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user inputs, specifically the lack of input sanitization for the command results and file overwrite functionality, allowing an attacker to inject malicious characters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Remote File Overwrite: Attackers can overwrite arbitrary files on the system due to insufficient input sanitization and lack of restrictions when writing command results into files.
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE): Overwriting critical system files can lead to remote code execution.
    - Command Injection: The vulnerability is based on injecting characters that have special meaning in the command interpreter.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Denial of Service (DoS): Overwriting files essential to the system or application can cause it to become unusable.
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE): By overwriting specific files with malicious code, the attacker can gain the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the system.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - By exploiting the command output functionality in the application, the attacker can inject characters like `<` and `>` in the command's output. These characters can then be used to redirect the output to a file, allowing attackers to overwrite any file in the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application to inject the malicious characters into the command output.
    - The attacker needs to know where important or critical files are located.
