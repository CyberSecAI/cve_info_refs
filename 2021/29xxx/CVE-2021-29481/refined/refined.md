Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29481:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the default configuration of client-side sessions in Ratpack, where session data is stored in cookies without encryption. Although the data is signed, it is not encrypted, making the content readable if the cookie is intercepted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Lack of Encryption:**  The primary vulnerability is the absence of encryption for session data stored in cookies. This exposes sensitive information if cookies are compromised.
- **Default Insecure Configuration:** The default behavior of the application is to store session data in an unencrypted form, making it vulnerable out of the box.
- **Dependency on User Configuration:** While the documentation recommends using an encryption key, it is not enforced, leaving the application vulnerable if the user does not explicitly configure it.
- **Missing `httpOnly` flag:** The cookies are not configured with `httpOnly`, increasing risk of exposure from XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** If an attacker gains access to the session cookies (e.g., via XSS or network interception), they can read sensitive data stored in the session. This includes any personal or private data stored within the session.
- **Potential for further attacks:** While no direct impact to integrity or availability is noted in the description, a compromise of the session data can lead to further attacks that may impact system integrity or availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Interception:** An attacker could intercept network traffic and steal session cookies.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could exploit an XSS vulnerability to steal session cookies via malicious JavaScript code.
- **Physical access:** Any method where an attacker can gain access to the cookies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access:** Ability to monitor or intercept network traffic to capture cookies.
- **Ability to inject malicious code (XSS):** For cookie theft via XSS, the attacker would need to exploit an XSS vulnerability in the application.
- **Access to the client's machine:** For cookie theft via malicious software or other local access methods.
