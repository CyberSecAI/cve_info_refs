Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-29241:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a NULL pointer dereference within the CmpGateway component of CODESYS products. This occurs when crafted communication requests are sent to the affected products.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-476:** NULL Pointer Dereference. The CmpGateway component fails to handle specific crafted communication requests, leading to a dereference of a NULL pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The targeted CODESYS product becomes unresponsive or crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, meaning an attacker does not need physical access to the system.
- The attack vector is through crafted communication requests sent to the CODESYS Gateway component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the targeted CODESYS product.
- Low skill level is sufficient to exploit this vulnerability.
- No special privileges are required to exploit it.
- No public exploits were known at the time of the advisory.

**Affected Products:**
The following products are affected (prior to the mentioned versions):
  - CODESYS Edge Gateway for Linux (all versions prior to V4.1.0.0)
  - CODESYS Control V3 Runtime System Toolkit (all versions prior to V3.5.16.70)
  - CODESYS Development System (all versions prior to V3.5.16.70)
  - CODESYS Edge Gateway for Windows (all versions prior to V3.5.16.70)
  - CODESYS Gateway V3 (all versions prior to V3.5.16.70)

The CmpGateway component was removed in newer versions of the following products. Therefore the specific mentioned versions and higher are not vulnerable:
   - CODESYS Control for BeagleBone SL (prior to V4.0.1.0)
   - CODESYS Control for emPC-A/iMX6 SL (prior to V4.0.1.0)
   - CODESYS Control for IOT2000 SL (prior to V4.0.1.0)
   - CODESYS Control for Linux SL (prior to V4.0.1.0)
   - CODESYS Control for PFC100 SL (prior to V3.5.16.0)
   - CODESYS Control for PFC200 SL (prior to V3.5.16.0)
   - CODESYS Control for Raspberry Pi SL (prior to V4.0.1.0)

**Mitigation:**
- The primary mitigation is to update the affected products to the specified fixed versions or later.
- General security recommendations include:
    - Use controllers in a protected environment.
    - Use firewalls to segment networks.
    - Use VPNs for remote access.
    - Activate user management and password features.
    - Use encrypted communication.
    - Apply physical and OS access restrictions.
    - Use up-to-date virus detecting solutions.

**Severity:**
CODESYS has rated this vulnerability as high with a CVSS v3.0 base score of 7.5. The vector string is CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.
