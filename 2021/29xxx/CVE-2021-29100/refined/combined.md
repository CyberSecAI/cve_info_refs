# ArcGIS Earth Security Update

By RandallWilliams and Michael Young

A path traversal vulnerability exists in Esri ArcGIS Earth versions 1.11.0 and below which allows arbitrary file creation on an affected system through crafted input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain arbitrary code execution under security context of the user running ArcGIS Earth by inducing the user to upload a crafted file to an affected system.

Mitigating measures:

* Do not accept or open files or attachments unexpectedly receivedfrom others.
* Follow the principle of least privileges when allocating OS accounts. Do not grant desktop users local administrator rights.

Esri has released an update for ArcGIS Earth that resolves this high-risk vulnerability [*here*](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-earth/overview).
