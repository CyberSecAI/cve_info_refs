# Invalid validation in `QuantizeAndDequantizeV2`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-mq5c-prh3-3f3h
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

The validation in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV2` allows invalid values for `axis` argument:

```
import tensorflow as tf

input_tensor = tf.constant([0.0], shape=[1], dtype=float)
input_min = tf.constant(-10.0)
input_max = tf.constant(-10.0)

tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV2(
  input=input_tensor, input_min=input_min, input_max=input_max,
  signed_input=False, num_bits=1, range_given=False, round_mode='HALF_TO_EVEN',
  narrow_range=False, axis=-2)
```

The [validation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.cc#L74-L77) uses `||` to mix two different conditions:

```
OP_REQUIRES(ctx,
  (axis_ == -1 || axis_ < input.shape().dims()),
  errors::InvalidArgument(...));
```

If `axis_ < -1` the condition in `OP_REQUIRES` will still be true, but this value of `axis_` results in heap underflow. This allows attackers to read/write to other data on the heap.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [c5b0d5f8ac19888e46ca14b0e27562e7fbbee9a9](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c5b0d5f8ac19888e46ca14b0e27562e7fbbee9a9).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang and Ying Wang of Baidu X-Team.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-29610

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
