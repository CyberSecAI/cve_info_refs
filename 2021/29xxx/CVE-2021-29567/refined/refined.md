{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Lack of validation of input dimensions in `tf.raw_ops.SparseDenseCwiseMul`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
       "Heap buffer overflow",
       "Denial of service"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can trigger a denial of service by causing `CHECK` failures or out-of-bounds memory accesses, potentially leading to program termination or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting malicious input tensors with invalid shapes and dimensions to the `tf.raw_ops.SparseDenseCwiseMul` function. Specifically, by providing inconsistent dimensions between the indices and values input tensors.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `tf.raw_ops.SparseDenseCwiseMul` function. No special capabilities are needed."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The issue is fixed by adding a validation check to ensure that the first dimension of the `values` and `indices` tensors match.",
     "The fix is included in TensorFlow versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2, and 2.5.0."
