# Lack of validation in `SparseDenseCwiseMul`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-wp3c-xw9g-gpcg
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

Due to lack of validation in `tf.raw_ops.SparseDenseCwiseMul`, an attacker can trigger denial of service via `CHECK`-fails or accesses to outside the bounds of heap allocated data:

```
import tensorflow as tf

indices = tf.constant([], shape=[10, 0], dtype=tf.int64)
values = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.int64)
shape = tf.constant([0, 0], shape=[2], dtype=tf.int64)
dense = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.int64)

tf.raw_ops.SparseDenseCwiseMul(
    sp_indices=indices, sp_values=values, sp_shape=shape, dense=dense)
```

Since the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/38178a2f7a681a7835bb0912702a134bfe3b4d84/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_dense_binary_op_shared.cc#L68-L80) only validates the rank of the input arguments but no [constraints between dimensions](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/raw_ops/SparseDenseCwiseMul), an attacker can abuse them to trigger internal `CHECK` assertions (and cause program termination, denial of service) or to write to memory outside of bounds of heap allocated tensor buffers.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [7ae2af34087fb4b5c8915279efd03da3b81028bc](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/7ae2af34087fb4b5c8915279efd03da3b81028bc).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang and Ying Wang of Baidu X-Team.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-29567

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
