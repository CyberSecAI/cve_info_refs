Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29397:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The NorthStar Club Management 6.3 software uses the insecure HTTP protocol (port 80) for login, which leads to the transmission of sensitive information in cleartext.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information: User credentials are sent over HTTP without encryption.
- Use of Insecure Protocol: The application relies on HTTP instead of HTTPS for login functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Theft:** Attackers can intercept and steal user login credentials (username and password) if they are on the same network.
- **Account Compromise:** Stolen credentials can be used to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Data Breach:** If compromised accounts have access to sensitive information, this could lead to a data breach.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Sniffing:** An attacker positioned on the same network as the user can capture the HTTP traffic and intercept the cleartext credentials during login.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the victim user. This could include being on the same LAN, connected to the same public Wi-Fi, or having access to a compromised network device.
- **Packet Sniffing Tools:** The attacker would need access to network monitoring tools capable of capturing network traffic.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ardent Security during a penetration test.
- The vendor was notified of the vulnerability, and multiple 90-day periods were given to fix the vulnerability.
