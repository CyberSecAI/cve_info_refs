The provided content relates to CVE-2021-29532.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation within the `tf.raw_ops.RaggedCross` operation in TensorFlow. The code iterates through input tensors based on an `input_order` string, using `next_ragged`, `next_sparse`, and `next_dense` indices to access elements within lists of ragged, sparse and dense tensors, respectively. However, it does not validate if these indices remain within the bounds of the corresponding lists, which results in out-of-bounds reads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the `RaggedCrossOp` within `tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_cross_op.cc`.
- Lack of validation for user-supplied arguments to `tf.raw_ops.RaggedCross`, specifically the indexes `next_ragged`, `next_sparse`, and `next_dense` which are used to access lists of input tensors.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can force accesses outside the bounds of heap-allocated arrays, potentially leading to a crash or information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting specific input tensors and `input_order` string to `tf.raw_ops.RaggedCross`, an attacker can cause out-of-bounds access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply inputs to `tf.raw_ops.RaggedCross`. This could be through a model they control or a modified graph within TensorFlow.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions before 2.5.0.
- The fix involves adding checks to ensure `next_ragged`, `next_sparse`, and `next_dense` are within the bounds of their respective lists before accessing the elements.
- Patched versions include 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2 with the fix included in commit `44b7f486c0143f68b56c34e2d01e146ee445134a`.
