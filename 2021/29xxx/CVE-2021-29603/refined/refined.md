{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the TFLite implementation of `ArgMin`/`ArgMax` where an out-of-bounds write occurs due to an incorrect handling of the `axis_value`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "A specially crafted TFLite model can trigger a heap out-of-bounds write. This could lead to crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted TFLite model with an invalid `axis_value` can trigger the vulnerability.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious TFLite model to a vulnerable system."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "patched_versions": "The vulnerability is fixed in TensorFlow versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2 and will be included in 2.5.0.",
     "fix": "The fix involves adding checks to validate the axis_value before proceeding with dimension copying. Specifically the following code was added to the `ResizeOutput` function in `tensorflow/lite/kernels/arg_min_max.cc`:\n\n```c\nif (axis_value < 0) {\n  axis_value += NumDimensions(input);\n}\nTF_LITE_ENSURE(context, axis_value >= 0);\nTF_LITE_ENSURE(context, axis_value < NumDimensions(input));\n```"
