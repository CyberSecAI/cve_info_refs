# Heap OOB write in TFLite

Moderate

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-crch-j389-5f84
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow-lite
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

A specially crafted TFLite model could trigger an OOB write on heap in the TFLite implementation of [`ArgMin`/`ArgMax`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/102b211d892f3abc14f845a72047809b39cc65ab/tensorflow/lite/kernels/arg_min_max.cc#L52-L59):

```
TfLiteIntArray* output_dims = TfLiteIntArrayCreate(NumDimensions(input) - 1);
int j = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < NumDimensions(input); ++i) {
  if (i != axis_value) {
    output_dims->data[j] = SizeOfDimension(input, i);
    ++j;
  }
}
```

If `axis_value` is not a value between 0 and `NumDimensions(input)`, then the condition in the `if` is never true, so code writes past the last valid element of `output_dims->data`.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [c59c37e7b2d563967da813fa50fe20b21f4da683](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c59c37e7b2d563967da813fa50fe20b21f4da683).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.

### Severity

If user passes an invalid axis, then we copy one too many dimensions to the output in the loop below these checks. Even if we didn't do that, there will be further issues with an invalid axis, so we check for that right now.
