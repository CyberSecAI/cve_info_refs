- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `arenavec` crate does not handle panics within user-provided `T::default()` and `T::drop()` functions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Uninitialized drop**: A panic in `T::default()` leads to dropping an uninitialized `T` object when `common::Slice::<T, H>::new()` is called.
    - **Double drop**: A panic in `T::drop()` leads to a double drop of `T` when `common::SliceVec::<T, H>::resize_with()` or `common::SliceVec::<T, H>::resize()` is called.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory corruption in the heap memory due to uninitialized or double drops of `T` objects.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by providing `T` types with implementations of `default()` or `drop()` that panic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to provide types `T` with panicking implementations of `default()` or `drop()`, typically through using the library in a way that permits user-defined types. The vulnerability is reachable via network access with low complexity, no user interaction and no privileges needed.
