Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29607:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incomplete input validation within the `tf.raw_ops.SparseSparseMinimum` operation in TensorFlow. Specifically, the code failed to validate that the input sparse tensors were not empty and that the second dimension of `*_indices` matched the size of the corresponding `*_shape`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Empty Tensor Check:** The code didn't check if the input tensors were empty.
- **Mismatched Dimension Check:** There was no validation to ensure that the second dimension of the `*_indices` tensor matched the size of the corresponding `*_shape` tensor.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Undefined Behavior:** Attackers could cause undefined behavior, such as dereferencing null pointers, by providing specially crafted, invalid sparse tensors.
- **Out-of-Bounds Write:** By exploiting the lack of validation, attackers could write outside the bounds of heap-allocated data, potentially leading to crashes, denial-of-service, or arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could provide specifically crafted sparse tensors as input to the `tf.raw_ops.SparseSparseMinimum` operation. These tensors would violate the expected structure of a sparse tensor (e.g., be empty or have mismatched dimensions)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the `tf.raw_ops.SparseSparseMinimum` operation. This means they would need to be able to craft tensors within a TensorFlow environment or have some means of injecting such tensors into a system running the vulnerable TensorFlow version.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_sparse_binary_op_shared.cc` file.
- The fix involves adding checks to ensure that tensors are not empty and that the second dimension of `*_indices` matches the size of corresponding `*_shape`.
- Patches were introduced in commits `ba6822bd7b7324ba201a28b2f278c29a98edbef2` and `f6fde895ef9c77d848061c0517f19d0ec2682f3a`.
- Affected versions include TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0, and the fixes were also backported to 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3 and 2.4.2.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity.
- The vulnerability was reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.
