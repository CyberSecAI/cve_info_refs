```
Fixes cases where specifying `fixed_length` resulted in data loss and even segfault and corruption of the Python interpreter. The fix is subtle but needed due to pointer arithmetic rules.

Makes sure that `fixed_length` does not change the output when present but not needed.

Eliminates needless copy and cast in the main codepath.

# Interpreter crash from `tf.io.decode\_raw`

Critical

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-8pmx-p244-g88h
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

The implementation of `tf.io.decode_raw` produces incorrect results and crashes the Python interpreter when combining `fixed_length` and wider datatypes.

```
import tensorflow as tf

tf.io.decode_raw(tf.constant(["1","2","3","4"]), tf.uint16, fixed_length=4)
```

The [implementation of the padded version](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc) is buggy due to a confusion about pointer arithmetic rules.

First, the code [computes](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L61) the width of each output element by dividing the `fixed_length` value to the size of the type argument:

```
int width = fixed_length / sizeof(T);
```

The `fixed_length` argument is also used to determine the [size needed for the output tensor](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L63-L79):

```
TensorShape out_shape = input.shape();
out_shape.AddDim(width);
Tensor* output_tensor = nullptr;
OP_REQUIRES_OK(context, context->allocate_output("output", out_shape, &output_tensor));

auto out = output_tensor->flat_inner_dims<T>();
T* out_data = out.data();
memset(out_data, 0, fixed_length * flat_in.size());
```

This is followed by [reencoding code](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L85-L94):

```
for (int64 i = 0; i < flat_in.size(); ++i) {
  const T* in_data = reinterpret_cast<const T*>(flat_in(i).data());

  if (flat_in(i).size() > fixed_length) {
    memcpy(out_data, in_data, fixed_length);
  } else {
    memcpy(out_data, in_data, flat_in(i).size());
  }
  out_data += fixed_length;
}
```

The erroneous code is the last line above: it is moving the `out_data` pointer by `fixed_length * sizeof(T)` bytes whereas it only copied at most `fixed_length` bytes from the input. This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output.

Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the reproducer mentioned here, but more severe attacks can be mounted too, given that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations in memory.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [698e01511f62a3c185754db78ebce0eee1f0184d](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/698e01511f62a3c185754db78ebce0eee1f0184d).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
