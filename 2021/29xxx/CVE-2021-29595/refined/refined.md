Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-29595

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a division-by-zero error in the `DepthToSpace` TFLite operator implementation. Specifically, the code calculates `output_channels` by dividing `input_channels` by `block_size` squared: `int output_channels = input_channels / block_size / block_size;`
- The `block_size` parameter is not validated to be greater than zero before the division operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of input validation for the `block_size` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious TensorFlow Lite model with a `block_size` parameter set to 0. This will cause a division-by-zero error during model execution, which can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted TensorFlow Lite model with a `block_size` of 0.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted TensorFlow Lite model to the vulnerable system.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix for this issue involves adding a check to ensure `block_size > 0` before performing the division operation.
- The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0. Patches have also been applied to versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
- The vulnerability was reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
