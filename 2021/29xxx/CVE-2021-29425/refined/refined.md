Guideline 1:
The content relates to CVE-2021-29425 based on the official description "The Apache Commons IO library, used in Apache Spark, is vulnerable to a limited path traversal vulnerability. When invoking the method FileNameUtils.normalize with an improper input string, like '//../foo', or '\\..\foo', the result would be the same value, thus possibly providing access to files in the parent directory. This method is used in the Spark UI and can allow an attacker to read files in the directory that spark is installed on. This is a limited path traversal vulnerability as only one level can be traversed"

Guideline 4:
- Root cause of vulnerability:
  - The `FileNameUtils.normalize` method in Apache Commons IO does not properly sanitize path strings containing `..` sequences, allowing for limited path traversal. Specifically, UNC paths are handled specially, and sequences such as "//../foo" are not properly normalized, and when the calling code uses the result to construct a path value, it may provide access to files in the parent directory.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Path traversal vulnerability due to improper sanitization of `..` sequences in file paths.

- Impact of exploitation:
  - Disclosure of sensitive information by gaining access to files in the parent directory of the application's installation path.

- Attack vectors:
  - Network attacks using HTTP, or local logon by providing an improper input string to `FileNameUtils.normalize` that is subsequently used to construct file paths.

- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - An attacker would need to be able to provide crafted input strings to the `FileNameUtils.normalize` method, whether through an HTTP request or locally.
  - In some cases, exploitation may also require a valid user account.
