Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29582:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation within the `tf.raw_ops.Dequantize` operation in TensorFlow. Specifically, the code does not verify if the `input_min_tensor` and `input_max_tensor` have the same shape before accessing them in parallel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap Out-of-Bounds Read:** When the shapes of `input_min_tensor` and `input_max_tensor` do not match, the code attempts to read data beyond the allocated memory boundaries. The vulnerability occurs within the loop where `min_ranges(i)` and `max_ranges(i)` are accessed.
- **Missing Shape Validation:** The primary weakness is the absence of a check to ensure that the shapes of the input minimum and maximum range tensors match.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Heap Out-of-Bounds Read:** An attacker can trigger a read from outside the bounds of heap-allocated memory. This can potentially lead to information disclosure or other undefined behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Input Tensors:** An attacker needs to provide specially crafted input tensors to the `tf.raw_ops.Dequantize` operation. Specifically:
    - The `input` tensor must be of type `tf.quint8`.
    - The `min_range` and `max_range` tensors must have mismatched shapes on the dequantization axis
    - The `axis` parameter must be set to 0.
    - `mode` must be 'SCALED'.
    - `narrow_range` must be set to true.
    - `dtype` should be `tf.dtypes.float32`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute TensorFlow code, and therefore control over the input tensors to `tf.raw_ops.Dequantize`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0.
- Patches have been applied to versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
- The fix involves validating the shapes of the `min_range` and `max_range` tensors to ensure they are compatible.
- The vulnerability was reported by Yakun Zhang and Ying Wang of Baidu X-Team.
- The severity of the vulnerability is considered low.
- The provided code snippet shows how an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
