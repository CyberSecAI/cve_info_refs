{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `child_process.exec()` function was used to execute a command string, which could lead to command injection even if arguments were escaped.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command injection vulnerability due to the use of `child_process.exec()` with potentially untrusted input.",
      "Inadequate sanitization of input when used with `child_process.exec()`."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system where the library is used.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing specially crafted, untrusted input as file paths to the vulnerable library, an attacker could inject commands.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to control the input to the vulnerable library function to specify malicious file paths."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was fixed by switching from `child_process.exec()` to `child_process.execFile()`. This allows for the command and arguments to be passed separately preventing the shell from interpreting the arguments as part of the command.  The advisory mentions this was a zero-day vulnerability."
