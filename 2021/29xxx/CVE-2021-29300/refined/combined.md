Fix command injection vulnerability

```
@ronomon/opened was vulnerable to a command injection vulnerability
that would allow a remote attacker to execute commands on the system if
the library was used with untrusted input.

The root cause of the problem was line 87 in index.js which took
potential untrusted input as part of a string executed as a command
by `child_process.exec()`. While the arguments were escaped by
@ronomon/opened, an attacker could still bypass this sanitization
because `child_process.exec()` will also interpret the string as a
shell command.

This fix moves to `execFile` to spawn the binary with separate
arguments that will not also be interpreted as shell commands.

Thanks to Fábio Freitas, a security analyst at Checkmarx's CxSCA group,
for discovering and disclosing the vulnerability, providing clear steps
to reproduce and suggestions for mitigation.
