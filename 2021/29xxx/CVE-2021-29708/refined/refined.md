- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerability exists in IBM Spectrum Scale CNSA that allows a local attacker with access to the GUI pod to establish an SSH connection to the core pods as a privileged user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in improper access control within the IBM Spectrum Scale CNSA environment, specifically allowing a user with limited access (GUI pod) to escalate privileges to core pods via SSH.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to gain privileged access to core pods, potentially enabling them to perform unauthorized actions within the system.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker who has already gained access to the GUI pod.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have local access to the GUI pod of an IBM Spectrum Scale CNSA deployment.
