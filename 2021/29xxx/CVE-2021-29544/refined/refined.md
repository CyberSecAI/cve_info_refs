Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29544:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing rank validation of the `input_min` and `input_max` tensors within the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad` implementation. Specifically, the code does not check if these tensors have a rank of 1 before passing them to the `QuantizeAndDequantizePerChannelGradientImpl` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper validation on the rank of the `input_min` and `input_max` tensors. The code assumes a rank of 1, but doesn't enforce it.
*   **Type Mismatch:**  The `QuantizeAndDequantizePerChannelGradientImpl` function uses `vec<T>()`, which expects rank 1 tensors, when these tensors are passed with a higher rank, leading to a type mismatch.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing `input_min` and `input_max` tensors with a rank different from 1, which triggers a `CHECK` failure and crashes the program.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Input Tensors:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting specific input tensors with an incorrect rank for `input_min` and `input_max` when calling `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to provide input tensors to the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad` function.
*   No specific position or privilege is needed beyond using the API.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.cc` file, specifically around lines 162-163.
*   The fix involves adding checks to ensure the `input_min` and `input_max` tensors have the correct rank before they are used, as seen in the provided commit diff.
* The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions 2.4.0 and 2.4.1. It is fixed in version 2.4.2, which includes the commit `20431e9044cf2ad3c0323c34888b192f3289af6b`.
