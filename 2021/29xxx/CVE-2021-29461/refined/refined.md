- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application `discord-recon` is vulnerable to command injection due to improper handling of user-supplied arguments when executing system commands. Specifically, the application didn't validate arguments passed to commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Command injection vulnerability.
    - Potential for local file inclusion (LFI) and arbitrary file write
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Arbitrary file reads
    - Arbitrary file writes
    - Remote code execution
- **Attack vectors:**
    - By supplying malicious arguments to the command execution functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide arguments to the vulnerable application
