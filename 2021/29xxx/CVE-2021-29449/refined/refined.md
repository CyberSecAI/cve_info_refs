Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-29449:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the lack of input validation in the `pihole` script, specifically within the `RemoveCustomCNAMERecord`, `RemoveCustomDNSAddress`, and `RemoveDHCPStaticAddress` functions. User-provided input is directly incorporated into `sed` commands without proper sanitization or escaping. This allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary commands into the `sed` commands executed by the `pihole` script.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The script fails to validate and sanitize user-provided input before using it in shell commands, allowing for the injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privilege user can gain root privileges by injecting malicious commands. The injected code is executed with the same privileges as the `pihole` script which runs with `sudo` permissions, and thereby becomes root.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system and the ability to execute the `/usr/local/bin/pihole` script with `sudo` privileges. Specifically, they need a low-privilege user with the same sudo configuration as the `www-data` user.
- **Command Injection via `pihole` Script Arguments:** The attacker crafts malicious input and passes it as arguments to the `pihole` script using the `-a removecustomcname`, `-a removecustomdns`, or `-a removestaticdhcp` options.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have a low-privilege shell on the target machine.
- The attacker must be able to execute the `/usr/local/bin/pihole` script with `sudo` privileges.
- The attacker needs to be able to add a fake entry in the files `/etc/dnsmasq.d/05-pihole-custom-cname.conf`, `/etc/pihole/custom.list` and `/etc/dnsmasq.d/04-pihole-static-dhcp.conf`
- Knowledge of `sed` command syntax and command injection techniques is required to craft the malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Pi-hole versions <= 5.2.4
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 5.3
- The specific malicious payload used is: `'a/d ; 1e exec sh 1>&0 ; /'` which injects three `sed` expressions, one of which spawns a root shell.
- The vulnerability exists in three separate functions, all related to removing configuration entries.
