- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Jazz Team Server is vulnerable to Clickjacking. This is due to the absence of `X-Frame-Options` and `Content-Security-Policy` headers in the HTTP response.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Clickjacking vulnerability. Specifically, the lack of appropriate HTTP headers (`X-Frame-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy`) to prevent framing of the application within other web pages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick users into unknowingly performing actions on the vulnerable web application by embedding it in a malicious page. This can lead to unauthorized access, modification or disclosure of sensitive information, depending on the application's functionalities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by embedding the vulnerable application's page inside an attacker-controlled webpage using an iframe.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website that the victim will visit. No specific access to the application server is required.
