- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to a flaw in IBM OpenPages with Watson that allows an authenticated user to upload a file which can then be used to execute arbitrary code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted file upload leading to remote code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is file upload via the application interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application to exploit this vulnerability.
