# Division by 0 in `FractionalAvgPool`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-f78g-q7r4-9wcv
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can cause a runtime division by zero error and denial of service in `tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPool`:

```
import tensorflow as tf

value = tf.constant([60], shape=[1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=tf.int32)
pooling_ratio = [1.0, 1.0000014345305555, 1.0, 1.0]
pseudo_random = False
overlapping = False
deterministic = False
seed = 0
seed2 = 0

tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPool(
  value=value, pooling_ratio=pooling_ratio, pseudo_random=pseudo_random,
  overlapping=overlapping, deterministic=deterministic, seed=seed, seed2=seed2)
```

This is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acc8ee69f5f46f92a3f1f11230f49c6ac266f10c/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L85-L89) computes a divisor quantity by dividing two user controlled values:

```
for (int i = 0; i < tensor_in_and_out_dims; ++i) {
  output_size[i] = static_cast<int>(std::floor(input_size[i] / pooling_ratio_[i]));
  DCHECK_GT(output_size[i], 0);
}
```

The user controls the values of `input_size[i]` and `pooling_ratio_[i]` (via the `value.shape()` and `pooling_ratio` arguments). If the value in `input_size[i]` is smaller than the `pooling_ratio_[i]`, then the floor operation results in `output_size[i]` being 0. The `DCHECK_GT` line is a no-op outside of debug mode, so in released versions of TF this does not trigger.

Later, these computed values [are used as arguments](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acc8ee69f5f46f92a3f1f11230f49c6ac266f10c/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L96-L99) to [`GeneratePoolingSequence`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acc8ee69f5f46f92a3f1f11230f49c6ac266f10c/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_pool_common.cc#L100-L108). There, the first computation is a division in a modulo operation:

```
std::vector<int64> GeneratePoolingSequence(int input_length, int output_length,
                                           GuardedPhiloxRandom* generator,
                                           bool pseudo_random) {
  ...
  if (input_length % output_length == 0) {
    diff = std::vector<int64>(output_length, input_length / output_length);
  }
  ...
}
```

Since `output_length` can be 0, this results in runtime crashing.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [548b5eaf23685d86f722233d8fbc21d0a4aecb96](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/548b5eaf23685d86f722233d8fbc21d0a4aecb96).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.
