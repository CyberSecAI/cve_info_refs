Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29550:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a division by zero error within the `FractionalAvgPool` operation in TensorFlow. This occurs due to a flaw in how output dimensions are calculated, allowing them to become zero under specific input conditions. Subsequently, this zero value is used as a divisor, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Division by Zero:** The core vulnerability is an exploitable division by zero error in the `GeneratePoolingSequence` function.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code calculates an `output_size` based on user-controlled inputs (`input_size` and `pooling_ratio`). When `input_size` is smaller than `pooling_ratio`, `output_size` becomes zero after floor operation, leading to division by zero in subsequent calculations.
- **Lack of Debug Mode Protection in Release:** While a debug check (`DCHECK_GT`) exists to prevent zero output size, it is not active in release builds. This allows the vulnerability to manifest in production environments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger a runtime division by zero error in the `FractionalAvgPool` operation, causing the TensorFlow process to crash. This leads to a denial of service for applications utilizing this TensorFlow functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulating Input Values:** An attacker can craft input tensors with dimensions and pooling ratios to specifically cause the computed output size to be zero, which then triggers the division by zero.
- **Direct API Calls:** The vulnerability is directly exploitable by calling the vulnerable `tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPool` operation with maliciously crafted inputs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the `tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPool` function, specifying `value.shape()` and `pooling_ratio`. This could be achieved through direct API calls or manipulation of model inputs in a vulnerable application.
- **No Special Privileges:** No special system privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability, making it easily exploitable by any user with access to the affected TensorFlow functionality.
