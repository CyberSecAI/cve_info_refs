Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-29964:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read in the `CommandLineParserWin::HandleCommandLine` function within Firefox and Thunderbird when processing `WM_COPYDATA` messages. The `WinRemoteMessageReceiver::Parse` function incorrectly assumes that the data pointed to by `COPYDATASTRUCT::lpData` is null-terminated. This assumption is incorrect, because the data is not always null terminated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The code attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer when processing the `WM_COPYDATA` message if the data is not null-terminated, potentially leading to a crash or the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** A hostile program can cause Firefox or Thunderbird to crash by sending a malformed `WM_COPYDATA` message.
- **Information Disclosure (Potential):** It's possible, though unlikely, that an attacker could craft the message in a way that causes the out-of-bounds read to access sensitive data, such as a website's access token, if such data happens to reside in adjacent memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local attack:** A locally installed program, even with lower privileges, can send malicious `WM_COPYDATA` messages to a running instance of Firefox or Thunderbird on Windows.
- The vulnerability is triggered via a `WM_COPYDATA` message that is not null-terminated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the victim's Windows system.
- The attacker doesn't require high privileges.
- The attacker can be on the same or a different user account to the vulnerable instance of Firefox or Thunderbird.

**Additional Notes**
- The bug affects Firefox and Thunderbird on Windows only.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 89, Firefox ESR 78.11, and Thunderbird 78.11.
- The fix involves adding a boundary check to ensure that the function does not read beyond the provided data length.
