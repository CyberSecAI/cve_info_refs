Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29569:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `tf.raw_ops.RequantizationRange` operation within TensorFlow. The implementation of this operation in `requantization_range_op.cc` does not properly validate the input tensors `input_min` and `input_max`. Specifically, it assumes that these tensors have at least one element. When these tensors are empty, accessing the 0th element using `.flat<float>()(0)` results in an out-of-bounds read, because the flat object is backed by an empty array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Out-of-Bounds Read:** The core vulnerability is a heap out-of-bounds read when accessing elements of the `input_min` and `input_max` tensors when they are empty.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code lacks proper validation to check if the `input_min` and `input_max` tensors are empty before accessing their elements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash or Denial of Service:** An attacker-controlled input can cause the program to crash due to the out-of-bounds read. This could potentially lead to a denial-of-service condition if exploited repeatedly.
- **Potential Information Leakage:** Although not explicitly stated in the provided text, out-of-bounds reads can sometimes lead to the exposure of sensitive information from memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Input Tensors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by supplying empty tensors as `input_min` and `input_max` to the `tf.raw_ops.RequantizationRange` operation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `tf.raw_ops.RequantizationRange` operation, meaning they must be able to manipulate the inputs to the TensorFlow model. This could be achieved in various scenarios where user-supplied data is processed by a TensorFlow model.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information includes a commit that patches the vulnerability. The patch adds checks to ensure that the `input_min` and `input_max` tensors are not empty.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity.
- The vulnerability was reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.
- The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0 and was fixed in versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
