This document discusses a post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR WiFi systems, identified by NETGEAR as PSV-2020-0466. While there's no associated CVE ID listed in the article, the provided details strongly suggest a relationship to CVE-2021-29075, as the product models and vulnerability descriptions match closely with the general information available for this CVE.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   A post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability exists in the affected NETGEAR products.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Stack overflow: The vulnerability stems from a stack overflow. This occurs when a program writes data beyond the allocated memory space for the stack, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
    *   **Confidentiality impact (C:H):** Unauthorized disclosure of information.
    *   **Integrity impact (I:H):** Unauthorized modification of data.
    *   **Availability impact (A:H):** Denial of service or other disruptions.
    * The CVSS vector indicates a change in scope (S:C) indicating that successful exploitation can impact beyond the vulnerable component itself.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Adjacent Network (AV:A):** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device to exploit it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **High privileges (PR:H):** The attacker needs to have administrative or other high-level access to the device which implies successful authentication is required before the vulnerability is reachable.
*   **Low attack complexity (AC:L):** The vulnerability is relatively easy to exploit once the attacker meets the required position and privileges.
*   **No user interaction (UI:N):** The attack does not require any interaction from the user besides having the necessary credentials.

**Affected products and firmware versions:**
*   RBW30, running firmware versions prior to 2.6.2.2
*   RBK852, RBK853, RBK854, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
*   RBR850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
*   RBS850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
*   RBK752, RBK753, RBK753S, RBK754, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
*   RBR750, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
*   RBS750, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12

**Mitigation:**
*   Update to the latest firmware version for the affected product models.
*   The advisory includes detailed instructions on how to locate and download firmware updates.
