Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29952:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A race condition exists in the WebRender component destruction process. Specifically, the `WebRenderBridgeParent::ClearResources` function was racing with `CompositorBridgeParent::GetCompositorBridgeParentFromWindowId`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Data race: Multiple threads were accessing and modifying shared WebRender data structures without proper synchronization, leading to undefined behavior. This was happening because the scene builder thread was incorrectly calling an API that should only be called on the compositor thread.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  The vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior. The security advisory states that, with enough effort, this could be exploited to run arbitrary code. The crash data shows crashes within `wr_api_delete` indicating potential memory corruption issues

**Attack vectors:**
- The race condition occurs during the destruction of WebRender components, which can be triggered by closing a window or during shutdown.
-  The vulnerability is triggered by a specific sequence of operations involving multiple threads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to trigger a scenario where a window is closed or during shutdown to trigger this race condition. The exact steps are not fully defined, but they would involve interactions with the WebRender component and its associated resources. The provided details mention a fuzzer found it.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found by ThreadSanitizer during fuzzing.
- The fix involved moving more of the work from the scene builder thread to the compositor thread to avoid the race.
- The fix was applied to Firefox versions 88.0.1, 89, and 90. It was not present in ESR78 builds, and backported to the 88 release.
- The bug was classified as "sec-moderate" initially, but there was discussion if it could be considered sec-high.
- A similar race was noted in `RenderThread.cpp` at another callsite.
