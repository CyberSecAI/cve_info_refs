Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-29097:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a buffer overflow that occurs due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length when parsing PMF files in Esri ArcReader. Specifically, data is copied to a fixed-length buffer without checking if the data exceeds the buffer's capacity. This lack of validation allows for a buffer overflow. This can occur in heap or stack based buffers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a buffer overflow (CWE-122, Heap-based buffer overflow or CWE-121 Stack-based buffer overflow).
- **Insufficient Data Validation:** The software fails to validate the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-size buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system within the context of the current process. This can lead to complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PMF Files:** An attacker can craft a malicious PMF file that contains oversized data.
- **User Interaction:** User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability. The target must either open the malicious PMF file or visit a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create and distribute a malicious PMF file or host it on a web page.
- The attacker requires the victim to open the malicious file or visit a malicious page hosting the file for the exploit to occur.

**Additional Notes:**
- Multiple reports for this vulnerability exist with different reporters and disclosure dates, although they all describe the same underlying issue.
- The vulnerability exists in Esri ArcReader when processing PMF files.
- Esri has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- The CVSS score is 7.8, indicating a high severity vulnerability.
- Both stack and heap based buffer overflows were identified for the same CVE
