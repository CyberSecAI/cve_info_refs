# ArcGIS general raster security update

By Michael Young

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified when processing specially crafted files that may allow arbitrary code execution in Esri ArcReader, ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Engine 10.8.1 (and earlier) and ArcGIS Pro 2.7 (and earlier).

Esri has released updates for the affected products that resolve the high-risk vulnerabilities [***here***](https://support.esri.com/en/download/7869).  For ArcGIS Pro, please use version 2.7.1 or later.

**Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS v3.1) Details**

7.8 Base Score, 6.8 Temporal Score

* Exploit Code Maturity: Unproven
* Remediation Level: Official Fix Available
* Report Confidence: Confirmed by Esri

[CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:U/RL:O/RC:C](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:U/RL:O/RC:C)

We provide the temporal score in addition to the base score to allow our customers to better assess risk of this vulnerability to their operations.  Please see [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss) for more information on the definition of these metrics.

**Vulnerability Details**

* [CVE-2021-29096](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-29096) – Use-After-Free – [CWE-416](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html) – CVSS 7.8
* [CVE-2021-29097](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-29097) – Buffer overflow – [CWE-122](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html) – CVSS 7.8
* [CVE-2021-29098](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-29098) – Uninitialized pointer – [CWE-824](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/824.html) – CVSS 7.8

## Esri ArcReader PMF File Parsing Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-21-369ZDI-CAN-12548

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-29097](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29097) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | Esri |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | ArcReader |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Esri ArcReader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PMF files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Esri has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

## Esri ArcReader PMF File Parsing Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-21-367ZDI-CAN-12490

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-29097](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-29097) |

| AFFECTED VENDORS | Esri |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | ArcReader |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Esri ArcReader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PMF files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Esri has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis/administration/security-advisory-general-raster> |
