# Crash in `tf.transpose` with complex inputs

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-xqfj-cr6q-pc8w
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

Passing a complex argument to `tf.transpose` at the same time as passing `conjugate=True` argument results in a crash:

```
import tensorflow as tf
tf.transpose(conjugate=True, a=complex(1))
```
### Patches

We have received a patch for the issue in GitHub commit [1dc6a7ce6e0b3e27a7ae650bfc05b195ca793f88](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1dc6a7ce6e0b3e27a7ae650bfc05b195ca793f88).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported in [#42105](https://github.com/tensorflow/issues/42105) and fixed in [#46973](https://github.com/tensorflow/issues/46973).

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-29618

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
