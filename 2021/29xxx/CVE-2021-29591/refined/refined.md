Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29591:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation in TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) graphs, specifically regarding loops between nodes. The `While` operator in TFLite could be exploited by creating a scenario where the condition and body subgraphs are the same. This would lead to an infinite loop or stack overflow during model evaluation due to recursive calls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing loop detection**: TFLite did not check for loops in the graph structure.
- **Recursive calls without limits**: The `While` operator could be tricked into recursively calling itself, exhausting the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Infinite loop:** A specially crafted model could cause an infinite loop during evaluation.
- **Stack overflow:** Recursive calls from the infinite loop could lead to stack exhaustion and a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted TFLite model:** An attacker could create a malicious TFLite model with a looped graph structure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to create and provide a crafted TFLite model.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability specifically impacts the TFLite interpreter when evaluating models with loops.
- The fix involves adding checks for recursion and ensuring that subgraphs are not used recursively.
