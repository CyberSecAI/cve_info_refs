Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-29972:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a use-after-free error in the pixman library, which is used by Cairo for graphics rendering. The root cause is an out-of-date Cairo library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The primary vulnerability is a heap-use-after-free, which occurs when the program attempts to access memory that has already been freed. This can lead to crashes, memory corruption, and potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **Outdated Library:** The issue was caused by an outdated version of the Cairo library being used in Firefox.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The most immediate impact is a browser crash.
- **Memory Corruption:** The use-after-free can lead to memory corruption.
- **Potential Code Execution:** While not explicitly demonstrated, the memory corruption could potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Page:** A specially crafted web page can trigger the vulnerability. The provided test case shows this.
- **Printing or Saving to PDF:** The vulnerability is triggered during the print or "Save to PDF" process, specifically within the graphics rendering pipeline.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to serve a malicious web page:** The attacker needs to host a webpage with the specific CSS that triggers the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to open the malicious web page and attempt to print it or save it as a PDF.

**Technical Details**

- The vulnerability occurs within the `_pixman_image_validate` function during the print or "Save to PDF" process.
- The ASAN (AddressSanitizer) output shows that a memory region is freed (`_moz_pixman_image_unref`) and then accessed after being freed within the `_pixman_image_validate` function.
- The specific CSS used in the test case involves setting a universal selector `*` with `clip-path: polygon`, a `<clip-source>`, a `<basic-shape>` with a value >=13 and `mix-blend-mode: soft-light`.
- The issue was resolved by updating the Cairo library to version 1.17.4 or higher.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was found by an external reporter, Irvan Kurniawan.
- The bug was classified as "sec-moderate"
- The vulnerability affects Firefox on multiple platforms (Linux, Windows).
- It was resolved in Firefox 90 and not backported to ESR78 or Firefox 88, 89
