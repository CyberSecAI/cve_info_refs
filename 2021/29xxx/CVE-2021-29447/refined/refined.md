Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-29447:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an XML External Entity (XXE) injection flaw in WordPress's handling of media file metadata, specifically within the `getID3` library when parsing XML data embedded in audio files.
- The vulnerability is triggered by the use of the `simplexml_load_string()` function with the `LIBXML_NOENT` flag, which enables entity substitution, in combination with a deprecated function. While `libxml_disable_entity_loader()` was previously used to prevent XXE, this function was deprecated in PHP 8. WordPress updated the code to conditionally call `libxml_disable_entity_loader()` only when using a PHP version less than 8 which introduced this vulnerability in PHP 8 when the default behavior of libxml disabled external entity loading. The `LIBXML_NOENT` flag forces the external entity resolution to occur regardless of the libxml version default setting.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XXE Injection:** The core weakness is the improper parsing of XML data from user-uploaded files. By injecting crafted XML with external entity references, attackers can trigger the retrieval of local files or initiate server-side requests.
- **Misconfigured XML Parser:** The usage of  `LIBXML_NOENT` flag on the `simplexml_load_string()` function enables entity substitution which combined with the removal of the deprecated `libxml_disable_entity_loader()` in PHP 8, re-introduced the XXE vulnerability previously fixed in WordPress 3.9.2.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** Attackers can read the content of any file on the server's file system, including sensitive configuration files like `wp-config.php` which contains database credentials.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Attackers can make HTTP requests from the server on behalf of the WordPress installation, which could be used to target internal services or external systems.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Media File Upload:** The attack vector involves uploading specially crafted audio files (specifically WAVE files) that contain malicious XML within the `iXML` chunk. This XML is processed by WordPress when extracting metadata using the `getID3` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have the ability to upload files to the WordPress media library. This typically requires at least "author" privileges in a standard WordPress installation. However, it could be exploited with lower privileges if other plugins allow media uploads by other user roles.
- **PHP 8:** The vulnerability is specifically triggered when WordPress is running on PHP 8.
- **Blind XXE Knowledge:** Because the results of the XML parsing are not directly displayed to the user, attackers need to use Blind XXE techniques (like Out-of-Band XXE) involving parameter entities and external DTDs to exfiltrate data by making requests to attacker-controlled servers based on the data being leaked.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was initially fixed in WordPress 3.9.2 but was reintroduced in PHP 8 because the fix relied on disabling the libxml entity loader, a function that was deprecated in PHP 8 which now defaults to disabling external entities.
- The fix implemented in WordPress 5.7.1 reintroduces the deprecated  `libxml_disable_entity_loader()` to explicitly disable the external entity loading, even in newer PHP versions.
- A possible alternative fix was using PHP's  `libxml_set_external_entity_loader()` function to have a more granular control over the entity loading.
