Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29663:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when adding a job title in the admin panel. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that gets stored in the application's database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The primary vulnerability is that user input is not sanitized before being stored in the database. This means that any user input containing JavaScript code will be stored as is, and executed by the browser when the data is retrieved and displayed on a page.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not implement proper input validation or sanitization mechanisms to remove or neutralize HTML and JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** When an administrator or a user visits the registration page (`add_user.php`), the stored JavaScript code is executed in their browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** The provided exploit uses `alert(document.cookie)` to demonstrate the ability to steal user session cookies, which would allow an attacker to impersonate legitimate users.
- **Malware Delivery:** An attacker could potentially redirect users to malicious websites, deliver malware, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Defacement:** An attacker could modify the content displayed on the page, causing defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious POST request to `/coursems/admin/add_jobs.php`.
- **Malicious Payload:** The POST request includes a payload within the "name" field: `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`. This JavaScript code is injected into the application and later executed on other users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin Access:** The attacker needs administrative access to the CoursMS application to access `/coursems/admin/add_jobs.php`.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint to send the crafted HTTP request.

**Additional Details:**
- **Target URL:** The registration page vulnerable to the stored XSS is `http://18.188.117.223/coursems/add_user.php`.
- **Software Version:** The vulnerable version is CoursMS 2.1.
- **Proof of Concept:** The provided content includes a working proof of concept (POC) demonstrating the stored XSS.
