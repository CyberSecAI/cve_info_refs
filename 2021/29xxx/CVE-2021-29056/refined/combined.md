| Product: pixelimity Download: <https://github.com/pixelimity/pixelimity/> Vunlerable Version: latest version Tested Version: latest version Author:qianxiao996  Description: Pixelimity CMS is prone to a Persistent Cross-Site Scripting attack that allows a malicious user to inject HTML or scripts that can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by your browser and used with that site.  Advisory Details: A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) was discovered in ‚Äúportfolio latest version‚Äù, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability exist due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in the ‚Äúdata%5Bsite\_name%5D‚Äù HTTP POST parameter passed to the ‚Äú/admin/setting.php‚Äù URL. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the context of the vulnerable website. The exploitation example below uses the "alert()" JavaScript function to see a pop-up messagebox: Proof of concept: 1„ÄÅLogin as admin. 2„ÄÅLocate URL - <http://127.0.0.39/pixelimity/admin/portfolio.php> and click on "Setting" 3„ÄÅPut XSS payload in the "data%5Bsite\_name%5D" parameter Pixelimity"><script>alert(1)</script> and click on "Save Setting" [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24933098/111962486-50c7e980-8b2d-11eb-9ec5-4a4fd955f020.png) [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24933098/111962554-650be680-8b2d-11eb-8978-7d7aced7737f.png) [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24933098/111962860-d2b81280-8b2d-11eb-8365-2f6076e861a8.png) |
