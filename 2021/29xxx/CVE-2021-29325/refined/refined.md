    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a heap-buffer-overflow in the `fx_String_prototype_repeat` function.",

      "Heap-buffer-overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The heap-buffer-overflow can lead to a crash due to memory corruption.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a specific JavaScript code that uses the `String.prototype.repeat` function with a very large argument, leading to an out-of-bounds write during the memory allocation for the string.",
