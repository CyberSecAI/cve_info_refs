- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Nim standard library's `httpClient` did not validate peer SSL/TLS certificates by default.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure default setting of disabling SSL/TLS certificate verification.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. This could lead to an attacker intercepting and manipulating communication between the client and the server, leading to potential data modification (high integrity impact)
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the client and server.
