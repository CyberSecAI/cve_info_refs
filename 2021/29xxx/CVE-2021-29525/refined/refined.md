Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29525:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a division by zero error within the `tf.raw_ops.Conv2DBackpropInput` operation in TensorFlow.
- The division occurs when calculating `shard_size` which depends on `work_unit_size`. The `work_unit_size` can be zero when the input tensors have a specific shape that makes the calculation of `size_A`, `size_B`, and `size_C` result in 0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Division by Zero:** The core issue is the potential for `work_unit_size` to be zero, leading to a division-by-zero error when calculating `shard_size`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a crash or halt of the TensorFlow program by providing specific input tensor shapes that result in a division by zero.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Input Tensors:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the shape of the input tensors (`input_tensor`, `filter_tensor`, `out_backprop`) passed to the `tf.raw_ops.Conv2DBackpropInput` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to control or influence the input tensors' shapes that are provided as arguments to `tf.raw_ops.Conv2DBackpropInput` operation.
- This could be in the context of a model being trained/executed where user-provided data shapes are used.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability exists in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0.
- Patches were applied to versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3 and 2.4.2 to address the issue.
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure that `work_unit_size` is greater than zero before division.
- The exploit is demonstrated with a sample code snippet using  `tf.constant` to create the vulnerable input.
- The GitHub commit `2be2cdf3a123e231b16f766aa0e27d56b4606535` contains the fix.
