    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue in the Linux kernel's vhost-vdpa module. It occurs because the 'v->config_ctx' pointer isn't reset to NULL after its eventfd context is released, which can lead to a double free and other issues if the character device is reopened. Successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause is the failure to reset the `v->config_ctx` pointer to NULL after releasing the associated `eventfd_ctx`, leading to a use-after-free condition if the character device is reopened.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use-after-free vulnerability in the vhost-vdpa module of the Linux kernel.",
        "Incorrect handling of the `v->config_ctx` pointer leading to a double free if the same character device is re-opened."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by repeatedly opening and closing the same vhost-vdpa character device (e.g., /dev/vhost-vdpa-0).",
      "attacker_capabilities": "A local attacker with the ability to open and close the vhost-vdpa device is required to trigger this vulnerability."

    "additional_notes": "The provided content includes the NetApp advisory NTAP-20210513-0005 which specifically addresses CVE-2021-29266. It notes that NetApp products incorporating Linux Kernel versions prior to 5.11.9 are affected. The git commit log provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability and the code fix, which includes adding `v->config_ctx = NULL;` after the `eventfd_ctx_put(v->config_ctx);` call. The NetApp advisory also lists the specific NetApp products affected and notes that there are no workarounds available, and some affected products will not be patched."
