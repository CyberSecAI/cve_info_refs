We have an issue where the dimensions are not matching and this causes Eigen to crash on an assert.

Then, we have an issue where we accidentally do a division by 0.

# Division by zero in `Conv3D`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-772p-x54p-hjrv
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

A malicious user could trigger a division by 0 in `Conv3D` implementation:

```
import tensorflow as tf

input_tensor = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=tf.float32)
filter_tensor = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=tf.float32)

tf.raw_ops.Conv3D(input=input_tensor, filter=filter_tensor, strides=[1, 56, 56, 56, 1], padding='VALID', data_format='NDHWC', dilations=[1, 1, 1, 23, 1])
```

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/42033603003965bffac51ae171b51801565e002d/tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_ops_3d.cc#L143-L145) does a modulo operation based on user controlled input:

```
  const int64 out_depth = filter.dim_size(4);
  OP_REQUIRES(context, in_depth % filter_depth == 0, ...);
```

Thus, when `filter` has a 0 as the fifth element, this results in a division by 0.

Additionally, if the shape of the two tensors is not valid, an Eigen assertion can be triggered, resulting in a program crash:

```
import tensorflow as tf

input_tensor = tf.constant([], shape=[2, 2, 2, 2, 0], dtype=tf.float32)
filter_tensor = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 2, 6, 2], dtype=tf.float32)

tf.raw_ops.Conv3D(input=input_tensor, filter=filter_tensor, strides=[1, 56, 39, 34, 1], padding='VALID', data_format='NDHWC', dilations=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1])
```

The shape of the two tensors must follow the constraints specified in the [op description](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/raw_ops/Conv3D).

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [799f835a3dfa00a4d852defa29b15841eea9d64f](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/799f835a3dfa00a4d852defa29b15841eea9d64f).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution
