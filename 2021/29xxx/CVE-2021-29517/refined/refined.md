Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29517:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a division by zero error within the `Conv3D` implementation in TensorFlow.
- Specifically, the code performs a modulo operation (`in_depth % filter_depth`) where `filter_depth` is derived from user-controlled input (filter tensor's dimension). If the filter tensor has a dimension of zero, this results in a division-by-zero.
- Additionally, shape mismatch between input tensors leads to an Eigen assertion failure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Division by zero: The code doesn't validate if filter depth is zero before performing the modulo operation.
- Assertion failure: Lack of proper input validation of dimensions allows triggering an assertion failure causing a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious user can cause a division-by-zero error by providing crafted input filter tensors, leading to a crash or abnormal termination of the TensorFlow process.
- **Program Crash:** Providing input tensors with shapes not complying with Conv3D operation will trigger an assertion error, causing the program to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious user provides crafted input tensors to the `tf.raw_ops.Conv3D` function, specifically setting the filter tensor's fifth dimension to 0 or not respecting the shape constraints for the Conv3D operation.
- This can be achieved through any code path that uses the `Conv3D` operation with potentially attacker-controlled inputs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to control the input parameters of the `tf.raw_ops.Conv3D` function, specifically the filter tensor and/or the input tensor shapes.
- No special privileges or system access is required beyond being able to run TensorFlow code.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was patched in commit `799f835a3dfa00a4d852defa29b15841eea9d64f`.
- Patched versions include TensorFlow 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2. The fix will also be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Low" severity.
