- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A user-provided implementation of the `Endian` trait, which is intended to be a safe trait, can panic. This panic occurs after a duplicated ownership of type `T` has been created by `ptr::read()`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a double-drop (or double free) of a memory location. This occurs because the code does not properly handle panics within user-provided `Endian` trait implementations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A double-drop can cause memory corruption in the heap, which can lead to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the execution of code that relies on the `endian_trait` crate and uses a user-provided, panicking `Endian` implementation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to supply a panicking implementation of the `Endian` trait. This often requires controlling the code that defines the implementation used by the vulnerable program.
