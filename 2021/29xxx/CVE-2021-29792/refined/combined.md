# Security Bulletin: Event Streams documentation for generating .p12 files incorrectly adds the CA key into the file (CVE-2021-29792)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Event Streams documentation for generating .p12 files incorrectly adds the CA private key into the file which results in the CA private key being added to the trust store. This trust store is distributed to client applications via the Event Streams UI and CLI and so gives client access to the CA private key. This issue only arises when using custom provided certificates and following the Event Streams documentation to generate the .p12 file.

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2021-29792](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-29792)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| IBM Event Streams | 10.0.x |
| IBM Event Streams | 10.1.x |
| IBM Event Streams | 10.2.x |
| IBM Event Streams | 10.3.x |

## Remediation/Fixes

When generating your PKCS12 truststore, ensure that the truststore does not contain the CA private key. This is important because the `.p12` file will be available to download from the Event Streams UI and distributed to clients.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

Refer to the [IBM Event Streams documentation](https://ibm.github.io/event-streams/installing/configuring/#providing-a-ca-certificate-and-key "IBM Event Streams documentation") when providing a CA certificate and key.
