  "CVE-2021-29792": {
    "Description": "Event Streams documentation for generating .p12 files incorrectly adds the CA private key into the file which results in the CA private key being added to the trust store. This trust store is distributed to client applications via the Event Streams UI and CLI and so gives client access to the CA private key. This issue only arises when using custom provided certificates and following the Event Streams documentation to generate the .p12 file.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The documentation for generating .p12 files incorrectly instructs users to include the CA private key in the file.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Inclusion of CA private key in trust store.",
      "Distribution of the trust store containing the CA private key to client applications via UI and CLI."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Client applications gain access to the CA private key.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Following the incorrect documentation.",
      "Downloading the .p12 file from the Event Streams UI or CLI."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to the .p12 trust store file, which is available from the Event Streams UI or CLI."
  }
