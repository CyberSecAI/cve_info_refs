Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
- It occurs due to insufficient sanitization or validation of user-supplied input within the `report_type` parameter of the `archive.php` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The provided input in the `report_type` parameter is reflected back in the response without proper encoding or sanitization. This allows malicious JavaScript code to be executed in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites, potentially disguised as the original site.
- **Cookie Stealing:** Attackers can steal user session cookies, leading to account takeover.
- **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can redirect to pages that serve malware.
- A skilled attacker can perform other malicious actions using the XSS vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the `report_type` parameter.
- The user visits the crafted URL, which triggers the vulnerability.
- The malicious JavaScript code then executes within the user's browser session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft and distribute malicious URLs.
- The attacker needs a user to click the malicious link to trigger the XSS.
- The attacker does not need any specific access, only to manipulate the `report_type` parameter within the URL.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `report_type`
- **Vulnerable File:** `archive.php`
- **Payload Example:** `1"autofocus onfocus=alert(1) //"`
- **Proof of Concept URL:** `https://localhost/seopanel/archive.php?from_time=2021-03-18&order_col=url&order_val=DESC&report_type=1"autofocus onfocus=alert(1) //"&search_name=&sec=reportSummary&to_time=2021-03-19&type=&website_id=http://www.example.com`
