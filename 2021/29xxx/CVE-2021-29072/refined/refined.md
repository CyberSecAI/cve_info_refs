**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a post-authentication command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Command injection vulnerability that can be exploited after authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device. The CVSS score indicates a high impact with high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is adjacent (A), meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the target device. The attack requires a high level of privileges (PR:H), which suggests the attacker must first authenticate with administrator level credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be on the same network as the affected device and have administrative privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected devices:**
* RBK852, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
* RBK853, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
* RBK854, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
* RBR850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
