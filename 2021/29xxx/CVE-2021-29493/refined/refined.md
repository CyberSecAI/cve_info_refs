The provided content contains information about CVE-2021-29493.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploit present in the Tickets module of the Red Discord Bot. It stems from how user input is handled when creating a new ticket. Specifically, the `default_message_ticket_channel` setting allows for the formatting of a message that is sent when a new ticket is created. This formatting uses the `format()` function on the `default_message_ticket_channel` string with user-controlled values which could potentially allow a malicious user to inject code or reveal sensitive data. The vulnerable code is found in the `create_ticket` method of the `TicketsCore` class in the `tickets/core.py` file. The code uses `default_message_ticket_channel.format(member=SafeMember(author), channel=ticket_channel, origin=context.channel, ticket_role=ticket_role)` which can be exploited.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- Improper input sanitization/validation
- Unsafe use of `format()` on user-provided data

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious message that can be executed by the bot.
- This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, data exfiltration, or other harmful activities on the server where the bot is running.
- The attacker could potentially take control of the bot.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafting a malicious message using Discord's chat interface that is used in the `default_message_ticket_channel` settings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be a Discord user able to trigger the creation of a new ticket in a server where the vulnerable bot is operating.
- The attacker needs to manipulate the `default_message_ticket_channel` settings through the bot's interface.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was patched in commit `5a84d60018468e5c0346f7ee74b2b4650a6dade7`.
- The fix involves wrapping the member object in a `SafeMember` class before formatting to prevent execution of injected code through the `format` function.
- A workaround was provided to unload the tickets module to prevent the exploit.
