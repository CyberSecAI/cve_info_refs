Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29364:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds write error in IrfanView when processing RLE (Run-Length Encoding) files. Specifically, it occurs at the memory location `Formats!ReadRAS_W+0x1001`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The application writes data beyond the allocated buffer, leading to potential memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption: Exploitation can lead to memory corruption which could cause application crashes or potentially allow for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing malicious RLE files: The vulnerability is triggered when IrfanView attempts to process a specially crafted RLE file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious RLE file to the vulnerable IrfanView application.
- No specific privileges are mentioned in this document, implying that simply opening the crafted file is enough to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided information is more descriptive than a typical CVE description, since it includes the specific memory address where the out-of-bounds write occurs. The content also shows that this vulnerability is part of a series of vulnerabilities found in IrfanView 4.57, some of which are triggered by processing different file types or within different functions.
