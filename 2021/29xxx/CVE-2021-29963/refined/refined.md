Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29963:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that address bar search suggestions in Firefox for Android's private browsing mode were not isolated from normal browsing mode. Specifically, search suggestions requests were re-using session data (cookies) from the normal mode.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Privacy Violation:** Private browsing mode is intended to prevent the storage and reuse of browsing data, however, in this case, session cookies from normal browsing mode were being used in private browsing mode.
- **Cookie Sharing:** The browser was not properly isolating the private browsing session, leading to unintended sharing of cookies with the search provider.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Leakage:**  Search providers (e.g., Google) could link a user's normal browsing activity with their private browsing activity due to the shared cookies.
- **Privacy Compromise:** The user's expectation of privacy when using private browsing mode was violated.

**Attack vectors:**
- The user initiates a search within the address bar while using private browsing mode in Firefox for Android.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker is the search provider receiving the search queries and cookies.
- The attacker does not need to perform a separate action. It is passive and the user has already interacted with their service

**Additional details:**
- This issue was specific to Firefox for Android and did not affect other platforms.
- The issue was fixed in Firefox version 89.
- The bug report mentions that the code responsible is within the `SearchSuggestionProvider.kt` file in the android-components repository.
- The fix involved ensuring that search suggestions in private browsing mode do not reuse cookies from normal browsing sessions.
