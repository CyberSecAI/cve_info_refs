{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the `tf.raw_ops.RFFT` implementation where it doesn't handle the case of an empty input matrix properly, leading to Eigen code attempting to operate on an empty matrix.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The code lacks proper validation of the input `fft_length` leading to an empty matrix being used in FFT operations. Specifically, when `fft_length` is set to 0, it results in a zero-sized matrix for the FFT operation which triggers an assertion failure.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by triggering a `CHECK`-failure, leading to program termination.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can craft a specific input for `tf.raw_ops.RFFT` where the `fft_length` is set to 0, causing the Eigen library to operate on an empty matrix, triggering the assertion failure and the denial of service.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the capability to call the `tf.raw_ops.RFFT` function with user-controlled inputs (specifically the `fft_length` parameter)."
