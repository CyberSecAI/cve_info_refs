Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29571:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing check on the size of the third dimension of the `boxes` input tensor in the `tf.raw_ops.DrawBoundingBoxesV2` operation. The implementation assumes that this dimension is always 4, as specified in the op's documentation. However, this is not validated before accessing the tensor, leading to out-of-bounds reads and writes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read/write:** The code directly accesses `tboxes(b, bb, 0)`, `tboxes(b, bb, 1)`, `tboxes(b, bb, 2)`, and `tboxes(b, bb, 3)` without verifying that the third dimension of `boxes` is of size 4. If the third dimension is less than 4, the code reads from memory locations outside of the allocated buffer and can also write to out of bounds memory locations, leading to memory corruption.
- **Missing input validation:** The primary vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input validation for the `boxes` tensor's third dimension.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** Attackers can cause arbitrary memory corruption by providing specially crafted input tensors where the third dimension of boxes tensor is less than 4. This can lead to various issues, including program crashes, unexpected behavior, or potentially more severe consequences like arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of Service:** By exploiting the vulnerability, attackers could crash the application using the affected TensorFlow code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Input Manipulation:** The attack vector is directly through the input tensors to `tf.raw_ops.DrawBoundingBoxesV2`. An attacker can create input tensors where the third dimension of the `boxes` tensor is less than 4.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **TensorFlow API access:** The attacker must have access to use the TensorFlow API and specifically the vulnerable `tf.raw_ops.DrawBoundingBoxesV2` operation.
- **Ability to create/provide malicious input tensors:** The attacker needs to be able to construct input tensors with the vulnerable characteristics (i.e., the `boxes` tensor's third dimension is less than 4).

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit `79865b542f9ffdc9caeb255631f7c56f1d4b6517` addresses this vulnerability by adding a check to ensure that the third dimension of the `boxes` tensor is indeed 4 before accessing elements within the tensor.
- This vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0, with patches backported to 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
