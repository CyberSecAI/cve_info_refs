Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29587:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing check for zero before a division operation in the `Prepare` step of the `SpaceToDepth` TFLite operator. Specifically, the code calculates `output_height` and `output_width` by dividing `input_height` and `input_width` by `block_size`, respectively, without ensuring `block_size` is not zero.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Division by Zero:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for a division-by-zero error.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code fails to validate `block_size` before using it in a division operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash/Denial of Service:**  A division-by-zero error would likely lead to a crash of the TensorFlow Lite interpreter or a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted Model:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a TensorFlow Lite model where the `block_size` parameter is set to zero. When the TFLite interpreter attempts to prepare this model, the division-by-zero occurs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted TensorFlow Lite model to a system that uses the vulnerable `SpaceToDepth` operator. This could involve:
    - Persuading a user to load a malicious model.
    - Compromising a system that processes TFLite models.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `tensorflow/lite/kernels/space_to_depth.cc` file.
- The patch introduces a check to ensure that `block_size` is greater than zero before performing the division operation.
- The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0. Patches were also backported to versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
- The severity is rated as "Low."
- The vulnerability was reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
