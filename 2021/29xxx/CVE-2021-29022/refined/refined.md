Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29022:

**Verification:**
The provided content describes a Full Path Disclosure vulnerability in InvoicePlane CRM, which aligns with the general category of issues that a CVE entry might cover. Therefore, it's likely to be related.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `/upload/show_files/` endpoint in InvoicePlane, which reveals the full server path of uploaded files. This occurs because the application doesn't properly sanitize or restrict the output of file paths.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Full Path Disclosure (CWE-200):** The application exposes sensitive information, specifically the server's file system path, to unauthorized users.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's directory structure, including the exact location where uploaded files are stored. This information can be leveraged in further attacks, such as identifying other vulnerabilities, escalating privileges, or accessing sensitive files.
    * Although the attacker cannot directly access the files, it gives knowledge for further attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is accessed through the `/upload/show_files/` endpoint. The attacker can send a request to this specific URI to trigger the path disclosure.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs network access to the InvoicePlane application.
    *   No authentication is specifically mentioned as required to access the vulnerable endpoint, thus this seems to be a pre-auth vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content mentions an "upload file vulnerability" but is unrelated to this specific vulnerability.
* The *UPLOADS\_FOLDER* constant modification is not related to the path disclosure vulnerability.
* The provided images show the request to `/upload/show_files/` and the response, which includes the server path.
