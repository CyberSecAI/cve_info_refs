# Division by 0 in `DenseCountSparseOutput`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-qg48-85hg-mqc5
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=2.3.0, < 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can cause a denial of service via a FPE runtime error in `tf.raw_ops.DenseCountSparseOutput`:

```
import tensorflow as tf

values = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0], dtype=tf.int64)
weights = tf.constant([])

tf.raw_ops.DenseCountSparseOutput(
  values=values, weights=weights,
  minlength=-1, maxlength=58, binary_output=True)
```

This is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/efff014f3b2d8ef6141da30c806faf141297eca1/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L123-L127) computes a divisor value from user data but does not check that the result is 0 before doing the division:

```
int num_batch_elements = 1;
for (int i = 0; i < num_batch_dimensions; ++i) {
  num_batch_elements *= data.shape().dim_size(i);
}
int num_value_elements = data.shape().num_elements() / num_batch_elements;
```

Since `data` is given by the `values` argument, `num_batch_elements` is 0.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [da5ff2daf618591f64b2b62d9d9803951b945e9f](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/da5ff2daf618591f64b2b62d9d9803951b945e9f).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, and TensorFlow 2.3.3, as these are also affected.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.
