Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Envoy does not decode escaped slash sequences (`%2F` and `%5C`) in HTTP URL paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Path Traversal/Bypass:**  The lack of decoding allows an attacker to craft URLs with escaped slashes that bypass access control rules based on URL path matching.
- **Inconsistent Path Interpretation:** A discrepancy between how Envoy and backend servers interpret escaped slashes (`%2F`/`%5C` vs `/`/\`) exists, which can lead to unintended access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privileges:**  An attacker can bypass access control (RBAC, JWT) based on URL paths, gaining access to resources they shouldn't have.
- **Unauthorized Access:**  By crafting URLs with escaped slashes, attackers can access sensitive parts of the backend application that are normally protected by access controls on the Envoy proxy.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack vector involves an untrusted client sending HTTP requests with specially crafted URL paths containing escaped slash characters (e.g., `/something%2F..%2Fadmin`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Envoy proxy.
- **Knowledge of Target Application/Proxy:** An understanding of the application and the proxy's path-based access controls is necessary for successful exploitation. The attacker needs to know which paths are restricted and construct a URL that bypasses these restrictions using encoded slashes.
