# Bypass of path matching rules using escaped slash characters

High

[lizan](/lizan)
published
GHSA-4987-27fx-x6cf
May 11, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

1.18.2, 1.17.2, 1.16.3, 1.15.4

## Patched versions

1.18.3, 1.17.3, 1.16.4, 1.15.5

## Description

### Description

Envoy does not decode escaped slash sequences `%2F` and `%5C` in HTTP URL paths in versions 1.18.2 and before. A remote attacker may craft a path with escaped slashes, e.g. `/something%2F..%2Fadmin`, to bypass access control, e.g. a block on `/admin`. A backend server could then decode slash sequences and normalize path and provide an attacker access beyond the scope provided for by the access control policy.

### Impact

Escalation of Privileges when using RBAC or JWT filters with enforcement based on URL path. Users with back end servers that interpret `%2F` and `/` and `%5C` and `\` interchangeably are impacted.

### Attack Vector

URL paths containing escaped slash characters delivered by untrusted client.

### Patches

Envoy versions 1.18.3, 1.17.3, 1.16.4, 1.15.5 contain new path normalization option to decode escaped slash characters.

### Workarounds

If back end servers treat `%2F` and `/` and `%5C` and `\` interchangeably and a URL path based access control is configured, we recommend reconfiguring back end server to not treat `%2F` and `/` and `%5C` and `\` interchangeably if feasible.
