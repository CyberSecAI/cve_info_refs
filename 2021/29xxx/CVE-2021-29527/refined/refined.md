{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a division by zero in the `QuantizedConv2D` operation. The divisor is calculated using `filter_value_count`, which is equal to `filter_width * filter_height * input_depth`. If any of these dimensions are zero, the `filter_value_count` becomes zero, leading to division by zero.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Division by zero"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a division by zero error, leading to a crash or denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a specific input tensor and filter tensor with dimensions that result in a zero `filter_value_count` during the `QuantizedConv2D` operation.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to provide the input to the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedConv2D` operation with the filter dimension set to zero (e.g. shape=[1, 0, 1, 1])."
