Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-29248:

**CVE-2021-29248: Lack of secure flag on cookies**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application failed to set the "Secure" flag on a cookie.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The absence of the "Secure" flag on a cookie allows a remote attacker to potentially intercept the cookie over an unencrypted connection (HTTP).
*  **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could potentially obtain sensitive information from the cookie by intercepting it over a non-secure channel. This could lead to unauthorized access or information disclosure.
*   **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack. A man-in-the-middle attacker could intercept the cookie if the communication is not over HTTPS, allowing them to potentially obtain sensitive information stored in the cookie.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user and the BTCPay server.

**Additional Notes:**
