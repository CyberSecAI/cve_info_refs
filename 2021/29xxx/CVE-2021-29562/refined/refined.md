Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29562:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a `CHECK`-failure in the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.IRFFT` within the TensorFlow library. The issue arises when the input to the IRFFT operation results in Eigen code operating on an empty matrix. This triggers an assertion, leading to program termination.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A missing validation check on the computed FFT shape before passing it to the underlying Eigen library. Specifically, the code did not properly handle cases where the resulting FFT shape had zero elements, which causes the Eigen library to perform operations on an empty matrix, causing an assertion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause the TensorFlow program to crash by providing specially crafted input to the `tf.raw_ops.IRFFT` operation.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a specific input tensor and `fft_length` to `tf.raw_ops.IRFFT`, an attacker can cause the underlying Eigen library to operate on an empty matrix, triggering the assertion and program termination.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `tf.raw_ops.IRFFT` operation. This implies the attacker can either directly call the function with malicious arguments or control the input to a model/program using this operation.

**Additional details:**

- The provided code snippet demonstrates how to reproduce the vulnerability by setting `fft_length` to `[0]` which forces the shape of the FFT to have a zero element.
- The fix involves adding a check `full_fft_shape.num_elements() > 0` before performing operations on the FFT output, preventing the library from working with empty matrices.
- The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0 and has been patched in versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3 and 2.4.2 through cherry-picking the fix.
