Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29508:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the `Wire` library handles type information during deserialization. It's possible for an attacker to manipulate the serialized data by using a surrogate on the sender end. This allows them to pass information specifying a different type than expected by the receiving end, thus leading to the creation of arbitrary types during deserialization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure deserialization: The library doesn't properly validate the type information in serialized data, allowing for type substitution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary type creation: An attacker can cause the deserializer to instantiate arbitrary types, potentially leading to remote code execution or other severe security consequences. This is similar to the vulnerabilities found in .NET `BinaryFormatter`.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious payload: An attacker can craft a malicious payload that includes manipulated type information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious payload to be deserialized by a vulnerable instance of Wire.
- The attacker has to have control over the data that is being deserialized.
