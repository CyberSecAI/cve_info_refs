# Do not use Wire - Insecure deserialization

Critical

[rogeralsing](/rogeralsing)
published
GHSA-hpw7-3vq3-mmv6
May 11, 2021

## Package

nuget

Wire
([NuGet](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anuget))

## Affected versions

All

## Patched versions

None

## Description

Due to how Wire handles type information in its serialization format, malicious payloads can be passed to a deserializer. e.g. using a surrogate on the sender end, an attacker can pass information about a different type for the receiving end. And by doing so allowing the serializer to create any type on the deserializing end.

**This is the same issue that exists for .NET BinaryFormatter <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/ca2300?view=vs-2019>**

This also applies to the fork of Wire, AkkaDotNet/Hyperion.

Where we believe the maintainers deliberately are hiding this vulnerability from users:

See how the link to the original repo Wire, as removed from the Hyperion readme, just days after disclosing the vulnerability.
