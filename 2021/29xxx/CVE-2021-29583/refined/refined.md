Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29583:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation within the `FusedBatchNorm` implementation in TensorFlow. Specifically, the code fails to verify that the `scale`, `offset`, `mean`, and `variance` tensors have a number of elements consistent with the number of channels of the input tensor `x`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Heap Buffer Overflow:** When the `scale`, `offset`, `mean`, or `variance` tensors have fewer elements than the number of channels in input tensor `x`, the code attempts to access memory out of bounds during tensor indexing, leading to a heap buffer overflow.
2.  **Undefined Behavior:** If the tensors `scale`, `offset`, `mean`, or `variance` are empty (have zero elements), the lack of validation leads to a null pointer dereference, triggering undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:**  A heap buffer overflow can lead to various consequences, including:
    *   Denial of service (crashes)
    *   Potential for arbitrary code execution if the overflow corrupts critical data structures or function pointers in memory.
*   **Undefined Behavior:** Undefined behavior can manifest as unpredictable program behavior, crashes, or other unexpected outcomes.

**Attack Vectors:**

The vulnerability is triggered by crafting specific input tensors with a mismatch between the number of channels in `x` and the number of elements in `scale`, `offset`, `mean`, and `variance` tensors.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

An attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNorm` operation with the specified invalid tensor dimensions.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0.
*   Patches have been applied to versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
*   The fix was introduced in GitHub commit `6972f9dfe325636b3db4e0bc517ee22a159365c0`.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.
