Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29024:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2021-29024 and discusses a vulnerability in InvoicePlane 1.5.11 related to misconfigured web servers allowing unauthenticated directory listing and file downloads. This aligns with the vulnerability described.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Misconfigured Web Server:** The core issue is that a web server (like Apache) hosting InvoicePlane is not configured to prevent directory listing. Specifically, the server is not preventing direct access to directories.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties:** This is the specific CWE associated with this vulnerability.
*   **Unauthenticated Directory Listing:** The web server allows listing the contents of directories without requiring any authentication.
*   **Unauthenticated File Download:**  Users can directly download files located within the web server's directories without authentication.
*   **Lack of Proper Server-Side Protection:** The application attempted to use `.htaccess` files and authenticated URLs for downloads, but these mechanisms are ineffective if the server is not configured to enforce these rules, which is not the case in a default Apache setup.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can list directories and download sensitive files meant to be private, such as configuration files, database backups, or source code.
*   **Directory Traversal:** Attackers can use directory traversal techniques to access files outside the intended web root.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Requests:** Attackers send direct HTTP requests to the web server for specific directories.
*   **Directory Traversal Sequences:** Attackers may use "../" sequences in URLs to access files in parent directories.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the web server hosting the vulnerable InvoicePlane instance over the network.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any credentials or authentication to exploit this vulnerability. They can exploit the vulnerability with direct access to the server.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   **Mitigation Attempt:** The InvoicePlane developers had attempted to prevent this with `.htaccess` files and by using authenticated download URLs, but a server misconfiguration negates these protections.
*   **Patch:** The fix was to add `index.html` files to directories to prevent directory listing when the server is not properly configured, and this fix was delivered via pull request #754.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability is rated as HIGH with a CVSS score of 7.5.
*  **EPSS Score**: The Exploit Prediction Scoring System score is 0.691% which means that there is a 0.691% chance of this vulnerability being exploited within the next 30 days.
