# Heap buffer overflow in `BandedTriangularSolve`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-2xgj-xhgf-ggjv
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow in Eigen implementation of `tf.raw_ops.BandedTriangularSolve`:

```
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

matrix_array = np.array([])
matrix_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(np.reshape(matrix_array,(0,1)),dtype=tf.float32)
rhs_array = np.array([1,1])
rhs_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(np.reshape(rhs_array,(1,2)),dtype=tf.float32)
tf.raw_ops.BandedTriangularSolve(matrix=matrix_tensor,rhs=rhs_tensor)
```

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/banded_triangular_solve_op.cc#L269-L278) calls `ValidateInputTensors` for input validation but fails to validate that the two tensors are not empty:

```
void ValidateInputTensors(OpKernelContext* ctx, const Tensor& in0, const Tensor& in1) {
  OP_REQUIRES(
      ctx, in0.dims() >= 2,
      errors::InvalidArgument("In[0] ndims must be >= 2: ", in0.dims()));

  OP_REQUIRES(
      ctx, in1.dims() >= 2,
      errors::InvalidArgument("In[1] ndims must be >= 2: ", in1.dims()));
}
```

Furthermore, since `OP_REQUIRES` macro only stops execution of current function after setting `ctx->status()` to a non-OK value, callers of helper functions that use `OP_REQUIRES` must check value of `ctx->status()` before continuing. This doesn't happen [in this op's implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/banded_triangular_solve_op.cc#L219), hence the validation that is present is also not effective.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [ba6822bd7b7324ba201a28b2f278c29a98edbef2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ba6822bd7b7324ba201a28b2f278c29a98edbef2) followed by GitHub commit [0ab290774f91a23bebe30a358fde4e53ab4876a0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/0ab290774f91a23bebe30a358fde4e53ab4876a0).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.
