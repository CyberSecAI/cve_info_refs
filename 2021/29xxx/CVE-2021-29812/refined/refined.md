Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in IBM Jazz for Service Management.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding in the web UI. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will be stored and executed later when other users access the affected page.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
    *   Altering the intended functionality of the web UI.
    *   Potential disclosure of credentials within a trusted user session.
*   **Attack vectors**: An attacker can embed arbitrary JavaScript code into the application via the web UI. This injected script is then stored and executed within the browsers of other users who access the vulnerable parts of the application.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the application's web UI to inject the malicious script.
