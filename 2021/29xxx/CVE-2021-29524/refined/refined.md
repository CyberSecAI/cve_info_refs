Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29524:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a division-by-zero error within the `tf.raw_ops.Conv2DBackpropFilter` operation in TensorFlow. The code performs a modulus operation (`%`) where the divisor is taken from the filter shape, specifically the input depth. If the filter depth is zero, it results in a division-by-zero.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Division by Zero:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation of the filter's depth before performing the modulus operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker can craft a specific input tensor and filter sizes that would cause the division-by-zero error, crashing the TensorFlow process or potentially affecting system stability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specific set of inputs to `tf.raw_ops.Conv2DBackpropFilter`, particularly a filter shape where the input depth dimension is zero.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft TensorFlow Input:** The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the inputs to TensorFlow operations, specifically the arguments of `tf.raw_ops.Conv2DBackpropFilter`.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0. Patches were backported to 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure the filter depth is strictly greater than zero before the modulus operation.
- The problematic code is located in `tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_grad_shape_utils.cc`.
- The fix was implemented in commit `fca9874a9b42a2134f907d2fb46ab774a831404a`.
