Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-29023:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The password reset functionality in InvoicePlane v1.5.11 lacks rate limiting and uses a predictable method to generate password reset tokens.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-640: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password:** The password reset token generation is flawed and predictable. It concatenates the current server time and user email, then generates an MD5 hash from this combination, making it relatively easy to guess.
- **CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling:** There is no rate limiting on password reset requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can predict password reset tokens given a user's email and the approximate server time.
- By predicting password reset tokens, attackers could gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
- Could potentially lead to authenticated remote code execution by changing user passwords and logging into the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the password reset functionality of the InvoicePlane web application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to know the target user's email address and have an approximate time of the password reset request.
-  The attacker needs to be able to interact with the login and password reset features of the web application
