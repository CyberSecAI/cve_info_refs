- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A specially crafted sequence of hypervisor calls from a virtual machine can trigger a system crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in how the PowerVM hypervisor handles specific sequences of hypervisor calls.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a system crash and an outage of all virtual machines running on the same system.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to gain total control of a virtual machine running on the PowerVM hypervisor.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires total control of a virtual machine on the affected system to execute the malicious hypervisor calls.
