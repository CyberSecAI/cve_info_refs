Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29584:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow during the construction of a new tensor shape within the `SparseSplit` operation in TensorFlow. The `TensorShape` constructor was using a legacy implementation that didn't properly handle potential overflows when multiplying dimension sizes, leading to a `CHECK`-fail.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Integer overflow in tensor shape construction.
- Use of legacy implementation for `TensorShape` constructor that lacked overflow checks.
-  The `SparseSplit` operation's implementation was not validating the dimensions before constructing the shape which leads to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The integer overflow triggers a `CHECK`-fail, causing the TensorFlow process to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted input to the `tf.raw_ops.SparseSplit` operation with large dimension sizes that, when multiplied together during shape construction, result in an integer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide input to TensorFlow operations and run models.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0.
- Patches have been backported to versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
- The fix involves constructing the dense shape separately using `AddDimWithStatus` to prevent overflow during dimension size multiplication. The fix is in commit [4c0ee937c0f61c4fc5f5d32d9bb4c67428012a60](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4c0ee937c0f61c4fc5f5d32d9bb4c67428012a60).
- The provided example code shows how to trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is considered "Low" severity.
