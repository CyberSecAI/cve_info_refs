# `CHECK`-fail due to integer overflow

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-xvjm-fvxx-q3hv
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK`-fail in caused by an integer overflow in constructing a new tensor shape:

```
import tensorflow as tf

input_layer = 2**60-1
sparse_data = tf.raw_ops.SparseSplit(
    split_dim=1,
    indices=[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2),
    (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1)],
    values=[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0],
    shape=(input_layer, input_layer),
    num_split=2,
    name=None
    )
```

This is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0908c2f2397c099338b901b067f6495a5b96760b/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_split_op.cc#L66-L70) builds a dense shape without checking that the dimensions would not result in overflow:

```
sparse::SparseTensor sparse_tensor;
OP_REQUIRES_OK(context,
               sparse::SparseTensor::Create(
                 input_indices, input_values,
                 TensorShape(input_shape.vec<int64>()), &sparse_tensor));
```

The [`TensorShape` constructor](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/6f9896890c4c703ae0a0845394086e2e1e523299/tensorflow/core/framework/tensor_shape.cc#L183-L188) uses a `CHECK` operation which triggers when [`InitDims`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/6f9896890c4c703ae0a0845394086e2e1e523299/tensorflow/core/framework/tensor_shape.cc#L212-L296) returns a non-OK status.

```
template <class Shape>
TensorShapeBase<Shape>::TensorShapeBase(gtl::ArraySlice<int64> dim_sizes) {
  set_tag(REP16);
  set_data_type(DT_INVALID);
  TF_CHECK_OK(InitDims(dim_sizes));
}
```

In our scenario, this occurs when adding a dimension from the argument results in overflow:

```
template <class Shape>
Status TensorShapeBase<Shape>::InitDims(gtl::ArraySlice<int64> dim_sizes) {
  ...
  Status status = Status::OK();
  for (int64 s : dim_sizes) {
    status.Update(AddDimWithStatus(internal::SubtleMustCopy(s)));
    if (!status.ok()) {
      return status;
    }
  }
}

template <class Shape>
Status TensorShapeBase<Shape>::AddDimWithStatus(int64 size) {
  ...
  int64 new_num_elements;
  if (kIsPartial && (num_elements() < 0 || size < 0)) {
    new_num_elements = -1;
  } else {
    new_num_elements = MultiplyWithoutOverflow(num_elements(), size);
    if (TF_PREDICT_FALSE(new_num_elements < 0)) {
        return errors::Internal("Encountered overflow when multiplying ",
                                num_elements(), " with ", size,
                                ", result: ", new_num_elements);
      }
  }
  ...
}
```

This is a legacy implementation of the constructor and operations should use `BuildTensorShapeBase` or `AddDimWithStatus` to prevent `CHECK`-failures in the presence of overflows.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [4c0ee937c0f61c4fc5f5d32d9bb4c67428012a60](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4c0ee937c0f61c4fc5f5d32d9bb4c67428012a60).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information
