Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-29983:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an issue in how Firefox for Android handled exiting fullscreen mode, particularly with recursive iframes. The browser was attempting to send a `GeckoView:DOMFullscreenExited` message to the root actor and its ancestors when exiting fullscreen, instead of sending it to the children. This caused a mismatch in the fullscreen state between GeckoView and the Fenix application, resulting in the inability to exit fullscreen mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Incorrect event dispatching logic within GeckoView when exiting fullscreen mode, particularly with iframes.
- Mismatch of fullscreen state between GeckoView and Fenix application.
- Inability to exit fullscreen mode using the back button or other standard interactions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could create a malicious web page that forces the Firefox for Android browser into a persistent fullscreen mode.
- The user would be unable to exit the fullscreen mode using normal interactions (e.g. back button), effectively locking them into the malicious page.
- This could be used to create a convincing spoofing attack, potentially tricking users into interacting with fake UI elements or input fields, especially when combined with other spoofing techniques.

**Attack Vectors:**

- A malicious web page loaded in Firefox for Android.
- The page uses a recursive iframe to trigger the fullscreen lock vulnerability.
- User interaction (tap/click) is required to trigger the initial fullscreen request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Ability to host a malicious web page.
- No special browser permissions or local access needed.
- User must be using Firefox for Android
- Ability to construct a webpage with a recursive iframe and fullscreen request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was specific to Firefox for Android, other operating systems were unaffected
- The vulnerability was rated as a high severity security issue due to the potential for convincing spoofing attacks
- The fix involved using `document.exitFullscreen` method instead of traversing the tree to send events.
- The issue was resolved in Firefox versions 91 and later.
- The report also mentions an Android autocomplete appearing with a status bar which makes the spoof more convincing

This analysis provides more detail than the official CVE description, which simply states "Firefox for Android could get stuck in fullscreen mode".
