# Unrestricted File Upload

Thank you for visiting OWASP.org. We have migrated our community to a new web platform and regretably the content for this page needed to be programmatically ported from its previous wiki page. There’s still some work to be done.

This is an example of a Project or Chapter Page.

## Description

Uploaded files represent a significant risk to applications. The first
step in many attacks is to get some code to the system to be attacked.
Then the attack only needs to find a way to get the code executed. Using
a file upload helps the attacker accomplish the first step.

The consequences of unrestricted file upload can vary, including
complete system takeover, an overloaded file system or database,
forwarding attacks to back-end systems, client-side attacks, or simple
defacement. It depends on what the application does with the uploaded
file and especially where it is stored.

There are really two classes of problems here. The first is with the
file metadata, like the path and file name. These are generally provided
by the transport, such as HTTP multi-part encoding. This data may trick
the application into overwriting a critical file or storing the file in
a bad location. You must validate the metadata extremely carefully
before using it.

The other class of problem is with the file size or content. The range
of problems here depends entirely on what the file is used for. See the
examples below for some ideas about how files might be misused. To
protect against this type of attack, you should analyse everything your
application does with files and think carefully about what processing
and interpreters are involved.

## Risk Factors

* The impact of this vulnerability is high, supposed code can be
  executed in the server context or on the client side. The likelihood
  of detection for the attacker is high. The prevalence is common. As
  a result the severity of this type of vulnerability is high.
* It is important to check a file upload module’s access controls to
  examine the risks properly.
* Server-side attacks: The web server can be compromised by uploading
  and executing a web-shell which can run commands, browse system
  files, browse local resources, attack other servers, or exploit the
  local vulnerabilities, and so forth.
* Client-side attacks: Uploading malicious files can make the website
  vulnerable to client-side attacks such as
  [XSS](Cross-site_Scripting_%5C%28XSS%5C%29 "wikilink") or Cross-site Content
  Hijacking.
* Uploaded files can be abused to exploit other vulnerable sections of
  an application when a file on the same or a trusted server is needed
  (can again lead to client-side or server-side attacks)
* Uploaded files might trigger vulnerabilities in broken
  libraries/applications on the client side (e.g. iPhone MobileSafari
  LibTIFF Buffer Overflow).
* Uploaded files might trigger vulnerabilities in broken
  libraries/applications on the server side (e.g. ImageMagick flaw
  that called ImageTragick!).
* Uploaded files might trigger vulnerabilities in broken real-time
  monitoring tools (e.g. Symantec antivirus exploit by unpacking a RAR
  file)
* A malicious file such as a Unix shell script, a windows virus, an
  Excel file with a dangerous formula, or a reverse shell can be
  uploaded on the server in order to execute code by an administrator
  or webmaster later – on the victim’s machine.
* An attacker might be able to put a phishing page into the website or
  deface the website.
* The file storage server might be abused to host troublesome files
  including malwares, illegal software, or adult contents. Uploaded
  files might also contain malwares’ command and control data,
  violence and harassment messages, or steganographic data that can be
  used by criminal organisations.
* Uploaded sensitive files might be accessible by unauthorised people.
* File uploaders may disclose internal information such as server
  internal paths in their error messages.

## Examples

### Attacks on application platform

* Upload .jsp file into web tree - jsp code executed as the web user
* Upload .gif file to be resized - image library flaw exploited
* Upload huge files - file space denial of service
* Upload file using malicious path or name - overwrite a critical file
* Upload file containing personal data - other users access it
* Upload file containing “tags” - tags get executed as part of being
  “included” in a web page
* Upload .rar file to be scanned by antivirus - command executed on a
  server running the vulnerable antivirus software

### Attacks on other systems

* Upload .exe file into web tree - victims download trojaned
  executable
* Upload virus infected file - victims’ machines infected
* Upload .html file containing script - victim experiences [Cross-site
  Scripting (XSS)](Cross-site_Scripting_%5C%28XSS%5C%29 "wikilink")
* Upload .jpg file containing a Flash object - victim experiences
  Cross-site Content Hijacking.
* Upload .rar file to be scanned by antivirus - command executed on a
  client running the vulnerable antivirus software

## Weak Protections and Bypassing Methods

### Deny Listing File Extensions

This protection might be bypassed by:

* Finding missed extensions that can be executed on the server side or
  can be dangerous on the client side (e.g. “.php5”, “.pht”, “.phtml”,
  “.shtml”, “.asa”, “.cer”, “.asax”, “.swf”, or “.xap”).
* Finding flaws in a web server configuration when it parses files
  with double extensions or it executes them by providing a sensitive
  extension after a delimiter such as “/” or “;” character (e.g.
  “/file.jpg/index.php” when the “file.jpg” file contains PHP code and
  has been uploaded)
  + In Apache, a php file might be executed using the double
    extension technique such as “file.php.jpg” when “.jpg” is
    allowed.
  + In IIS6 (or prior versions), a script file can be executed by
    using one of these two methods:
    - by adding a semi-colon character after the forbidden
      extension and before the permitted one (e.g.
      “file.asp;.jpg”)
    - by renaming a script file’s extension (e.g. “.asp”) to an
      allowed extension (e.g. “.txt”) in a folder that its name
      ends with the script’s extension (e.g.
      “folder.asp\file.txt”). In Windows, it is possible to
      create a directory by using a file uploader and ADS
      (Alternate Data Stream). In this method, a filename that
      ends with “::$Index\_Allocation” or
      “:$I30:$Index\_Allocation” makes the file uploader to create
      a directory rather than a file (e.g.
      “folder.asp::$Index\_Allocation” creates “folder.asp” as a
      directory).
* Changing a number of letters to their capital forms to bypass case
  sensitive rules (e.g. “file.aSp” or “file.PHp3”).
* Using Windows 8.3 feature, it is possible to replace the existing
  files by using their shortname (e.g. “web.config” can be replaced by
  “web~1.con” or “.htaccess” can be replaced by “HTACCE~1”)
* Finding characters that are converted to other useful characters
  during the file upload process. For instance, when running PHP on
  IIS, the “>”, “<”, and double quote “ characters respectively
  convert to “?”, “\*”, and “.” characters that can be used to replace
  existing files (e.g. “web<<” can replace the “web.config” file).
  In order to include the double quote character in the filename in a
  normal file upload request, the filename in the
  “Content-Disposition” header should use single quotes (e.g.
  filename=’web”config’ to replace the “web.config” file).
* Finding neutral characters after a filename such as trailing spaces
  and dots in Windows filesystem or dot and slash characters in a
  Linux filesystem. These characters at the end of a filename will be
  removed automatically (e.g. “file.asp … … . . .. ..”, “file.asp
  “, or “file.asp.”). Although slash or backslash characters are also
  normally problematic characters, they can be ignored in a normal
  file upload request as anything before these characters may count as
  the directory name on the server-side; that said, they should be
  tried for a thorough test (e.g. “test.php/” or “test.php.\”).
* Finding flaws in extension detection techniques. A web server may
  use the first extension after the first dot (“.”) in the provided
  filename or use a flawed algorithm to detect the extension when
  there is none or multiple dot characters (e.g. “file.txt.jpg.php”).
* Using control characters such as null character (0x00) after a
  forbidden extension and before a permitted one may lead to a bypass.
  In this method, all the strings after the Null character will be
  discarded when saving the files. Both URL-encoded and decoded
  version of the null character should be tried in a file upload
  request for a thorough test.
* Using NTFS alternate data stream (ADS) in Windows. In this case, a
  colon character “:” will be inserted after a forbidden extension and
  before a permitted one. As a result, an empty file with the
  forbidden extension will be created on the server (e.g.
  “file.asax:.jpg”). This file might be edited later using other
  techniques such as using its short filename. The “::$data” pattern
  can also be used to create non-empty files. Therefore, adding a dot
  character after this pattern might also be useful to bypass further
  restrictions (.e.g. “file.asp::$data.”)
* Flaws in the protection mechanism when it replaces dangerous
  extensions. For instance, “file.p.phphp” might be changed to
  “file.php” after going through this functionality.
* Flaws in the uploaded file usage for instance when a PHP application
  uses the “include” function to show the uploaded images.
* Combination of the above techniques.

### Beating getimagesize()

The getimagesize() function will check if it is an image and will check
“mime” to verify image type.

Insecure Configuration :

```
<FilesMatch ".+\.ph(p([3457s]|\-s)?|t|tml)">
    SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FileMatch>

```

Secure Configuration :

```
<FilesMatch ".+\.ph(p([3457s]|\-s)?|t|tml)$">
    SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FileMatch>

```

If the service is up an running with the Insecure Configuration, any one
can beat the getimagesize function by writing comments in GIF file.

For that an end user needs to install an utility in Kali/Ubuntu OS named
‘gifsicle’

` For Kali Linux : apt-get install gifsicle For Ubuntu : sudo apt-get install gifsicle`

Once installed, the below commands will help writing the commands in a gif
file.

```
gifsicle < mygif.gif -- comment "

<?php echo 'Current PHP version: ' . phpversion(); ?>
" \> output.php.gif

```

The above command will create a file with the name “output.php.gif” which simply needs to be uploaded during the check of file upload
vulnerability.

### Allow Listing File Extensions

Applications that check the file extensions using an allow list method
also need to validate the full filename to prevent any bypass.

* The list of permitted extensions should be reviewed as it can
  contain malicious extensions as well. For instance, in case of
  having “.shtml” in the list, the application can be vulnerable to
  SSI attacks.
* Some of the bypass techniques for the deny list methods such as
  using double extensions are also applicable here and should be
  checked.

### “Content-Type” Header Validation

“Content-Type” entity in the header of the request indicates the
Internet media type of the message content. Sometimes web applications
use this parameter in order to recognise a file as a valid one. For
instance, they only accept the files with the “Content-Type” of
“text/plain”.

* It is possible to bypass this protection by changing this parameter
  in the request header using a web proxy.

### Using a File Type Detector

Sometimes web applications intentionally or unintentionally use some
functions (or APIs) to check the file types in order to process them
further. For instance, when an application resize an image file, it may
just show an error message when non-image files are uploaded without
saving them on the server.

* If it reads the few first characters (or headers), it can be
  bypassed by inserting malicious code after some valid header or
  within the file’s metadata.
* Inserting code in the comments section or those section that have no
  effect on the main file can also lead to a bypass.
* The inserted data can be obfuscated or encoded if the application
  detects a malicious code using specific patterns or signatures.
* Uploaded file can be crafted to create a malicious code in case of
  being compressed by the application.

### Other Interesting Test Cases

* Uploading a file when another file with the same name already
  exists. This may show interesting error messages that can lead to
  information disclosure. Logical flaws might be found if the
  application renames the new file to keep it on the server.
* Uploading a file when another folder with the same name already
  exists. This may show interesting error messages that can lead to
  information disclosure.
* Uploading a file with a long name. This may show interesting error
  messages that can lead to information disclosure.
* Uploading a file multiple times at the same time. This may show
  interesting error messages that can lead to information disclosure.
* Uploading valid and invalid files in different formats such as
  compressed or XML files to detect any possible processing on the
  server side.
* Uploading a file with “.”, “..”, or “…” as its name. For instance,
  in Apache in Windows, if the application saves the uploaded files in
  “/www/uploads/” directory, the “.” filename will create a file
  called “uploads” in the “/www/” directory.
* Uploading files that may not be deleted easily such as “…:.jpg” in
  NTFS that makes the “…” file (this file can be deleted using
  command line). This may show interesting error messages that can
  lead to information disclosure.
* Uploading a file in Windows with invalid characters such as
  |<>\*?” in its name. This may show interesting error messages that
  can lead to information disclosure.
* Uploading a file in Windows using reserved (forbidden) names such as
  CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8,
  COM9, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, and LPT9. This
  may show interesting error messages that can lead to information
  disclosure. Uploading a file with a reserved name may lead to denial
  of service if the application keeps the name and tries to save it
  with another extension (detecting it wrongly as an existing file).
* Cross-site content hijacking issues can be exploited by uploading a
  file with allowed name and extension but with Flash, PDF, or
  Silverlight contents.
* Uploading a “crossdomain.xml” or “clientaccesspolicy.xml” file can
  make a website vulnerable to cross-site content hijacking. These
  files should be uploaded to the root of the website to work.
  However, the “crossdomain.xml” file can be in a subdirectory as long
  as it is allowed in the root “crossdomain.xml” file.

### Important Notes in Testing File Uploaders

* Do not try to replace the existing files during testing unless it is
  safe to proceed. For instance, replacing configuration files such as
  “web.config” or “.htaccess” file can lead to a denial of service
  attack for the whole website.

## Prevention Methods (Solutions to be more secure)

In order to make a Windows server more secure, it is very important to
follow the Microsoft security best practices first. For this purpose,

  Countermeasures[1](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms994921.aspx)
* Understanding the Built-In User and Group Accounts in IIS

* IIS Security
  Checklist[3](http://windows.stanford.edu/docs/IISsecchecklist.htm)

And some special recommendations for the developers and webmasters:

* The file types allowed to be uploaded should be restricted to only
  those that are necessary for business functionality.
* Never accept a filename and its extension directly without having an
  allow list filter.
* The application should perform filtering and content checking on any
  files which are uploaded to the server. Files should be thoroughly
  scanned and validated before being made available to other users. If
  in doubt, the file should be discarded.
* It is necessary to have a list of only permitted extensions on the
  web application. And, file extension can be selected from the list.
  For instance, it can be a “select case” syntax (in case of having
  VBScript) to choose the file extension in regards to the real file
  extension.
* All the control characters and Unicode ones should be removed from
  the filenames and their extensions without any exception. Also, the
  special characters such as “;”, “:”, “>”, “<”, “/” ,”\”,
  additional “.”, “\*”, “%”, “$”, and so on should be discarded as
  well. If it is applicable and there is no need to have Unicode
  characters, it is highly recommended to only accept Alpha-Numeric
  characters and only 1 dot as an input for the file name and the
  extension; in which the file name and also the extension should not
  be empty at all (regular expression:
  `^\[a-zA-Z0-9\]{1,200}\\.\[a-zA-Z0-9\]{1,10}$`).
* Limit the filename length. For instance, the maximum length of the
  name of a file plus its extension should be less than 255 characters
  (without any directory) in an NTFS partition.
* It is recommended to use an algorithm to determine the filenames.
  For instance, a filename can be a hash of the name of file plus
  the date of the day.
* Uploaded directory should not have any “execute” permission and all
  the script handlers should be removed from these directories.
* Limit the file size to a maximum value in order to prevent denial of
  service attacks (on file space or other web application’s functions
  such as the image resizer).
* Restrict small size files as they can lead to denial of service
  attacks. So, the minimum size of files should be considered.
* Use Cross Site Request Forgery protection methods.
* Prevent from overwriting a file in case of having the same hash for
  both.
* Use a virus scanner on the server (if it is applicable). Or, if the
  contents of files are not confidential, a free virus scanner website
  can be used. In this case, file should be stored with a random name
  and without any extension on the server first, and after the virus
  checking (uploading to a free virus scanner website and getting back
  the result), it can be renamed to its specific name and extension.
* Try to use POST method instead of PUT (or GET!)
* Log users’ activities. However, the logging mechanism should be
  secured against log forgery and code injection itself.
* In case of having compressed file extract functions, contents of the
  compressed file should be checked one by one as a new file.
* If it is possible, consider saving the files in a database rather
  than on the filesystem.
* If files should be saved in a filesystem, consider using an isolated
  server with a different domain to serve the uploaded files.
* File uploaders should be only accessible to authenticated and
  authorised users if possible.
* Write permission should be removed from files and folders other than
  the upload folders. The upload folders should not serve any
* Ensure that configuration files such as “.htaccess” or “web.config”
  cannot be replaced using file uploaders. Ensure that appropriate
  settings are available to ignore the “.htaccess” or “web.config”
  files if uploaded in the upload directories.
* Ensure that files with double extensions (e.g. “file.php.txt”)
  cannot be executed especially in Apache.
* Ensure that uploaded files cannot be accessed by unauthorised users.
* Adding the “Content-Disposition: Attachment” and
  “X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff” headers to the response of static
  files will secure the website against Flash or PDF-based cross-site
  content-hijacking attacks. It is recommended that this practice be
  performed for all of the files that users need to download in all
  the modules that deal with a file download. Although this method
  does not fully secure the website against attacks using Silverlight
  or similar objects, it can mitigate the risk of using Adobe Flash
  and PDF objects, especially when uploading PDF files is permitted.
* Flash/PDF (crossdomain.xml) or Silverlight (clientaccesspolicy.xml)
  cross-domain policy files should be removed if they are not in use
  and there is no business requirement for Flash or Silverlight
  applications to communicate with the website.
* Browser caching should be disabled for the crossdomain.xml and
  clientaccesspolicy.xml files. This enables the website to easily
  update the file or restrict access to the Web services if necessary.
  Once the client access policy file is checked, it remains in effect
  for the browser session so the impact of non-caching to the end-user
  is minimal. This can be raised as a low or informational risk issue
  based on the content of the target website and security and
  complexity of the policy file(s).
* CORS headers should be reviewed to only be enabled for static or
  publicly accessible data. Otherwise, the
  “Access-Control-Allow-Origin” header should only contain authorised
  addresses. Other CORS headers such as
  “Access-Control-Allow-Credentials” should only be used when they are
  required. Items within the CORS headers such as
  “Access-Control-Allow-Methods” or “Access-Control-Allow-Headers”
  should be reviewed and removed if they are not required.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
