Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29601:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) implementation of the concatenation operation. Specifically, the code calculates the sum of dimensions along a specified axis using an integer variable (`sum_axis`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The `sum_axis` variable is an integer (`int`). An attacker can craft a TFLite model where the sum of the input tensor dimensions along the concatenation axis exceeds the maximum value of an `int`, resulting in an integer overflow. This overflow can lead to unexpected behavior in memory allocation and other operations, potentially leading to a crash.
- **Type Mismatch:** TFLite uses `int` for tensor dimensions, while TensorFlow (TF) uses `int64`. This discrepancy allows valid TF models, when converted to TFLite, to trigger the integer overflow because their dimensions are valid in the `int64` context but might lead to overflows in the `int` context.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is an integer overflow that can lead to a crash or other undefined behavior of the TFLite interpreter. The exact behavior is not detailed, but memory corruption or other similar effects are possible.
- The vulnerability can potentially lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Model:** An attacker can craft a malicious TFLite model specifically designed to trigger the integer overflow during the concatenation operation.
- **Model Conversion:** A valid TensorFlow model may cause a TFLite integer overflow after conversion, which can be triggered by the usage of TFLite.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Model Creation/Modification:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create or modify TFLite models.
- **Model Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious model to an application using the vulnerable TFLite library.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow Lite versions prior to 2.5.0.
- The fix was introduced in commit `4253f96a58486ffe84b61c0415bb234a4632ee73` and has been backported to versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
- The fix adds checks to ensure that the sum of dimensions does not exceed the maximum value of an integer. The added checks are located at `tensorflow/lite/kernels/concatenation.cc`, specifically between lines 71 and 74 within the `Prepare` function.
- The vulnerability was reported by the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
- The severity is rated as High.
