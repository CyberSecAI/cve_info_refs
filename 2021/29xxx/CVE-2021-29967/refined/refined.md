Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29967:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by memory safety bugs present in Firefox and Thunderbird. These bugs can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Memory corruption due to identified memory safety bugs. Specifically, the bug list mentions:
    - Crash in `_platform_memmove` (Bug 1602862)
    - Heap-use-after-free in `IPC::Channel::CloseClientFileDescriptor` (Bug 1703191)
    - Crash in `mozilla::glue::LoaderObserver::OnEndDllLoad` (Bug 1706041)
    - Assertion failure in `gc/Verifier.cpp` (Bug 1703760)
    - Heap-buffer-overflow in `js::wasm::LazyStubSegment::addStubs` (Bug 1704722)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution is possible with enough effort. The advisory states "we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code".
- Memory corruption.
- Program crashes.
- Possibly other unspecified negative impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation would likely involve crafting specific inputs or triggering specific code paths that would expose the memory safety issues.
- The specific method to trigger these issues is not detailed in the advisory, but the bugs are related to IPC, WASM, garbage collection, and dll loading which would suggest complex manipulation.
- It's noted that these are internal implementation issues, and not due to a web-based attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to trigger the specific conditions that cause the memory corruption. This likely requires an understanding of the internal workings of the browser or email client.
- No specific attack vector is given, but these are not related to network based attacks.
- Exploitation would be more easily achieved via a malicious extension or malicious software.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Firefox 88, Firefox ESR 78.10 and Thunderbird 78.11.
- Patches were released in Firefox 89, Firefox ESR 78.11, and Thunderbird 78.11 to address these issues.
- The reports suggest that the bugs were found internally or by the community, not by external malicious actors, thus no specific exploitation scenario is given.
- Gentoo Linux also released a security advisory (GLSA 202208-14) indicating the same vulnerability affected older versions of Thunderbird and should be upgraded.
