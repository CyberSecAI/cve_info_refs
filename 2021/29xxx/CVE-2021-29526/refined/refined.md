Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29526:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a division by a variable within the `tf.raw_ops.Conv2D` implementation in TensorFlow. This variable, which is controlled by the caller, can be zero or negative, leading to a division by zero error and program crash. Specifically, the code calculates `num_groups = in_depth / patch_depth` without checking if `patch_depth` is zero or negative.  Additionally, it doesn't check if `num_groups` is a positive number before using it in further calculations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Division by Zero:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for a division by zero error when computing the number of groups, leading to program termination. This is due to inadequate input validation on the patch_depth before performing the division.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code lacks sufficient input validation for the `patch_depth` variable, allowing a malicious user to provide a zero value or negative value leading to the error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a program crash, effectively causing a denial-of-service. By crafting input tensors with specific dimensions, an attacker can trigger the division by zero error and terminate the program.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `tf.raw_ops.Conv2D` operation.
- An attacker can control the input tensors (`input` and `filter`) dimensions, specifically the `patch_depth` which is `filter.dim_size(2)`
- The division is performed in the C++ backend of the `Conv2D` operation

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to provide input to the `tf.raw_ops.Conv2D` function. They would need to control or influence the shape of the input and filter tensors passed to the `Conv2D` operation.
- No special position or privilege is needed beyond being able to run or influence the execution of TensorFlow code.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located within the `tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_ops.cc` file.
- The fix involves adding checks to ensure that `patch_depth` and `num_groups` are strictly positive before using them in division operations.
- The vulnerability is considered low severity.
- Affected versions include TensorFlow versions less than 2.5.0
- Patched versions are 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3 and 2.4.2. The fix is also included in version 2.5.0
