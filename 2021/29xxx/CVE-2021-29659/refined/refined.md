- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A bug in the API endpoint related to the sharing dialog's user enumeration mitigation. The mitigation was intended to require at least 3 characters of a user's name or email to trigger the auto-complete dropdown, but the bug allowed enumeration using three whitespaces.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Information Exposure (CWE-200):** The vulnerability allowed an authenticated user to enumerate all user accounts on the system, which is a form of sensitive information exposure.
    - **Bypass of User Enumeration Mitigation**: The intended mitigation was circumvented, revealing the user list.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could enumerate all user accounts on the ownCloud instance, potentially aiding in further attacks by identifying valid targets for password guessing, social engineering, etc. Additionally, retrieval of all users on large instances could cause higher than average server load.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a single request to the API endpoint in the sharing dialog with three whitespaces as input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated user account is required to exploit the vulnerability.
