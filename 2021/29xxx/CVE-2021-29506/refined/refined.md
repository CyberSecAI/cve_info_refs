Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29506:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the usage of regular expressions in the `NavigateResource.java` file when parsing a URL to extract geographical points. Specifically, the code uses `replaceAll` which is vulnerable to regex injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Regex Injection:** The code uses `replaceAll("\\?[\*]", "")` on the URL, which is vulnerable to regex injection. An attacker could craft a malicious URL containing special characters that, when processed by the regex, could lead to excessive processing time and resource consumption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By injecting a specially crafted regex into the URL, an attacker can cause the server to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed remotely by sending a malicious HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker doesn't require elevated privileges to exploit the vulnerability

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects GraphHopper versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3.
- The fix was implemented in versions 2.4 and 3.0 by replacing regex with `indexOf` operation and additional checks.
- The vulnerability is present in the navigation module.
- The CVSS score is 6.5 (Moderate) with a base score of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`.
- The vulnerability was fixed via pull request [#2304](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/pull/2304)
