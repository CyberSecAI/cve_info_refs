Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29598:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing check for a zero value of `rank` in the TFLite implementation of the `SVDF` operator before performing a division operation (`num_filters / rank`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Division by zero vulnerability exists in the `tensorflow/lite/kernels/svdf.cc` file
- The code does not validate that `params->rank` is not zero.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploitation leads to a division-by-zero error, which can cause a crash or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious TensorFlow Lite model where the `rank` parameter for the `SVDF` operator is set to 0.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted TensorFlow Lite model to be processed by a vulnerable version of TensorFlow Lite.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the `rank` variable is not 0 before performing the division, as shown in commit [6841e522a3e7d48706a02e8819836e809f738682](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/6841e522a3e7d48706a02e8819836e809f738682)
- The vulnerability affects TensorFlow Lite versions prior to 2.5.0. Patches were also cherry-picked into versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2
- This vulnerability was reported by the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
