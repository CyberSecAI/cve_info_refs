# Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in Notes

High

[davidmehren](/davidmehren)
published
GHSA-gjg7-4j2h-94fq
May 11, 2021

## Package

hedgedoc

## Affected versions

<1.8.2

## Patched versions

1.8.2

## Description

### Impact

HedgeDoc is vulnerable to an XSS attack using the YAML-metadata of a note. An attacker with write access to a note can embed HTML tags in the Open Graph metadata section of the note, resulting in the frontend rendering the script tag as part of the `<head>` section.

This vulnerability affects all installations. Unless your instance prevents guests from editing notes, this vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to inject JavaScript into notes that allow guest edits. If your instance prevents guests from editing notes, this vulnerability allows authenticated attackers to inject JavaScript into any note pages they have write-access to.

### Patches

The simplest patch to this problem is to tell ejs to escape the input from Open Graph definitions.

```
diff --git a/public/views/hedgedoc/head.ejs b/public/views/hedgedoc/head.ejs
index 44668795..419d5dcc 100644
--- a/public/views/hedgedoc/head.ejs
+++ b/public/views/hedgedoc/head.ejs

 <%- include('../includes/favicon') %>
 <% for (var og in opengraph) { %>
 <% if (opengraph.hasOwnProperty(og) && opengraph[og].trim() !== '') { %>

 <meta property="og:image" content="<%- serverURL %>/icons/android-chrome-512x512.png">
 <meta property="og:image:alt" content="HedgeDoc logo">

```
### Workarounds

In order to prevent unauthenticated attacks in can be useful to disable guest edits until the next update. To do this set the following to configuration options:

```
{
    # other configs
    # …
     "allowAnonymous": false,
     "allowAnonymousEdits": false,

}
```

Or set the environment variables `CMD_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS=false` and `CMD_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_EDITS=false`.

This vulnerability was found by Filippo Cremonese.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
