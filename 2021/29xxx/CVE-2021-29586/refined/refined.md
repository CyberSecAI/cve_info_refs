Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29586:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing check in the optimized pooling implementations within TensorFlow Lite (TFLite). Specifically, the code fails to verify that the stride arguments (stride_height, stride_width) are not zero before using them in the `ComputePaddingHeightWidth` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Division by Zero:** The core weakness is the potential for a division by zero error. When the stride height or width is set to zero, it results in a division by zero during the `ComputePaddingHeightWidth` calculation, which can cause a crash or unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash/Denial of Service:** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a crash or denial of service within the application using TFLite, preventing it from functioning correctly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Models:** An attacker can create a specially crafted TensorFlow Lite model where the pooling operation's stride height or width is set to zero. When the application attempts to execute the crafted model, the division by zero occurs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Model Creation/Manipulation:** An attacker needs the ability to create or modify TFLite models.
- **Model Execution:** The attacker also requires a scenario where the malicious model will be loaded and executed by a vulnerable TFLite implementation.

**Additional Information:**
- **Patch:** The vulnerability has been fixed by adding checks to ensure that the stride height and width are greater than zero before calculations are made, preventing the division by zero. The fix was included in the following versions: 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2.
- **Vulnerable versions:** Versions prior to 2.5.0 are vulnerable.
- **Attribution:** The vulnerability was discovered by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
- The commit that fixed the issue is [5f7975d09eac0f10ed8a17dbb6f5964977725adc](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5f7975d09eac0f10ed8a17dbb6f5964977725adc).
- The vulnerability is considered **low** severity.
