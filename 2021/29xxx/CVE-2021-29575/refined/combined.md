# Overflow/denial of service in `tf.raw\_ops.ReverseSequence`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-6qgm-fv6v-rfpv
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.ReverseSequence` allows for stack overflow and/or `CHECK`-fail based denial of service.

```
import tensorflow as tf

input = tf.zeros([1, 1, 1], dtype=tf.int32)
seq_lengths = tf.constant([0], shape=[1], dtype=tf.int32)

tf.raw_ops.ReverseSequence(
    input=input, seq_lengths=seq_lengths, seq_dim=-2, batch_dim=0)
```

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5b3b071975e01f0d250c928b2a8f901cd53b90a7/tensorflow/core/kernels/reverse_sequence_op.cc#L114-L118) fails to validate that `seq_dim` and `batch_dim` arguments are valid.

Negative values for `seq_dim` can result in stack overflow or `CHECK`-failure, depending on the version of Eigen code used to implement the operation. Similar behavior can be exhibited by invalid values of `batch_dim`.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [ecf768cbe50cedc0a45ce1ee223146a3d3d26d23](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ecf768cbe50cedc0a45ce1ee223146a3d3d26d23).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-29575

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
