Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29575:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `tf.raw_ops.ReverseSequence` operation in TensorFlow fails to properly validate the `seq_dim` and `batch_dim` arguments.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing validation of `seq_dim` and `batch_dim` in the `ReverseSequenceOp` implementation. Specifically, the code does not check for invalid or negative values for these dimensions, leading to potential issues.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Stack overflow: Negative values for `seq_dim` can cause a stack overflow.
- Denial of service: Invalid values for `seq_dim` or `batch_dim` can lead to a `CHECK`-failure, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing crafted negative values for `seq_dim` or invalid values for `batch_dim` arguments to the `tf.raw_ops.ReverseSequence` operation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to control the inputs to the `tf.raw_ops.ReverseSequence` operation, specifically the `seq_dim` and `batch_dim` arguments. This could be achieved by providing malicious input to a TensorFlow model or application that utilizes this operation.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0.
- Patches have been applied in versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2 by adding checks to ensure that `seq_dim` and `batch_dim` are not negative.
- The fix is implemented in commit `ecf768cbe50cedc0a45ce1ee223146a3d3d26d23`.
- The vulnerability was reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as low.
