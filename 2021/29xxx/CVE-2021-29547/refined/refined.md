Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29547:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `QuantizedBatchNormWithGlobalNormalization` operation within TensorFlow. The implementation directly accesses the first element (index 0) of the float tensors representing the minimum and maximum values for input, mean, variance, beta, and gamma without validating if these tensors are empty. Specifically, the code uses `.flat<float>()(0)` to access the first element, which results in an out-of-bounds read when the tensor is empty.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds read due to the lack of validation on the size of input tensors before accessing their elements. When the input tensors (`input_min`, `input_max`, `mean_min`, `mean_max`, `var_min`, `var_max`, `beta_min`, `beta_max`, `gamma_min`, `gamma_max`) are empty, accessing index `0` leads to reading beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger a segmentation fault (segfault) and cause a denial-of-service by providing empty tensors as input to the `QuantizedBatchNormWithGlobalNormalization` operation. The segfault occurs when the program attempts to access memory outside of the allocated bounds.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the TensorFlow API `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedBatchNormWithGlobalNormalization`. An attacker can construct a TensorFlow program that passes empty tensors for the min/max inputs, triggering the out-of-bounds read during execution of the op.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to construct and execute a TensorFlow graph that includes the vulnerable `QuantizedBatchNormWithGlobalNormalization` operation, passing specifically crafted empty tensors as inputs. This means they would need to have the ability to provide the input to the model/operation or influence the construction of the computation graph.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided code snippet demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability using a simple TensorFlow graph.
*   The fix involves adding validation checks to ensure that the input tensors for the min/max values contain at least one element before attempting to access the first element.
*   The vulnerability was present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0, and patches have been backported to versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
*   The GitHub commit `d6ed5bcfe1dcab9e85a4d39931bd18d99018e75b` contains the fix.
