```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `QuantizedResizeBilinear` implementation does not validate the input tensors for the min and max quantization values. It assumes they are always valid scalars and tries to access their numeric values directly, leading to a heap buffer overflow if they are empty.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap buffer overflow due to lack of input validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow, potentially leading to a denial-of-service or other security issues.",
  "Attack vectors": "By providing empty tensors as input for the min and max quantization values to the `QuantizedResizeBilinear` operation.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to control the inputs to the `QuantizedResizeBilinear` operation."
