# Heap buffer overflow caused by rounding

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-jfp7-4j67-8r3q
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedResizeBilinear` by manipulating input values so that float rounding results in off-by-one error in accessing image elements:

```
import tensorflow as tf

l = [256, 328, 361, 17, 361, 361, 361, 361, 361, 361, 361, 361, 361, 361, 384]
images = tf.constant(l, shape=[1, 1, 15, 1], dtype=tf.qint32)
size = tf.constant([12, 6], shape=[2], dtype=tf.int32)
min = tf.constant(80.22522735595703)
max = tf.constant(80.39215850830078)

tf.raw_ops.QuantizedResizeBilinear(images=images, size=size, min=min, max=max,
                                   align_corners=True, half_pixel_centers=True)
```

This is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/44b7f486c0143f68b56c34e2d01e146ee445134a/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_resize_bilinear_op.cc#L62-L66) computes two integers (representing the upper and lower bounds for interpolation) by ceiling and flooring a floating point value:

```
const float in_f = std::floor(in);
interpolation->lower[i] = std::max(static_cast<int64>(in_f), static_cast<int64>(0));
interpolation->upper[i] = std::min(static_cast<int64>(std::ceil(in)), in_size - 1);
```

For some values of `in`, `interpolation->upper[i]` might be smaller than `interpolation->lower[i]`. This is an issue if `interpolation->upper[i]` is capped at `in_size-1` as it means that `interpolation->lower[i]` points outside of the image. Then, [in the interpolation code](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/44b7f486c0143f68b56c34e2d01e146ee445134a/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_resize_bilinear_op.cc#L245-L264), this would result in heap buffer overflow:

```
template <int RESOLUTION, typename T, typename T_SCALE, typename T_CALC>
inline void OutputLerpForChannels(const InterpolationCache<T_SCALE>& xs,
                                  const int64 x, const T_SCALE ys_ilerp,
                                  const int channels, const float min,
                                  const float max, const T* ys_input_lower_ptr,
                                  const T* ys_input_upper_ptr,
                                  T* output_y_ptr) {
  const int64 xs_lower = xs.lower[x];
  ...
  for (int c = 0; c < channels; ++c) {
    const T top_left = ys_input_lower_ptr[xs_lower + c];
    ...
  }
}
```

For the other cases where `interpolation->upper[i]` is smaller than `interpolation->lower[i]`, we can set them to be equal without affecting the output.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [f851613f8f0fb0c838d160ced13c134f778e3ce7](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f851613f8f0fb0c838d160ced13c134f778e3ce7).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

```
This was hard to fix. Due to the way we compute the pixels that influence an output pixel in resized images, for certain input configuration we might have issued a read to a pixel that is outside of boundary of the original image. This is because of floating errors that affected truncation results.
