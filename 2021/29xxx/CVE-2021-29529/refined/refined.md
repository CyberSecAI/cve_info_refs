Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29529:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a floating-point rounding error during the calculation of interpolation bounds in the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedResizeBilinear` operation. When resizing images, the code calculates lower and upper bounds for interpolation using `floor` and `ceil` operations on a floating-point value representing the input coordinate. Due to floating-point imprecision, the calculated upper bound can become less than the lower bound. This, combined with clamping the upper bound to `in_size - 1`, could lead to out-of-bounds memory access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap buffer overflow: The core vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the `OutputLerpForChannels` function.
- Off-by-one error: This arises because incorrect interpolation bounds are calculated due to rounding issues, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
- Incorrect boundary checks: The clamping of the upper bound to `in_size - 1` combined with the rounding issue, created the conditions for out-of-bounds access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow, which can lead to a crash, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution. The provided description and sample code demonstrate how specific input parameters can trigger this overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By crafting specific input values (image data, size, min, max, and alignment parameters) to `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedResizeBilinear`, an attacker can manipulate the internal floating-point values to induce the rounding error.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedResizeBilinear` function and control the relevant input parameters, such as the images, the target size, the quantization range, and the alignment settings.

**More Details:**

The provided content includes a code snippet that demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

l = [256, 328, 361, 17, 361, 361, 361, 361, 361, 361, 361, 361, 361, 361, 384]
images = tf.constant(l, shape=[1, 1, 15, 1], dtype=tf.qint32)
size = tf.constant([12, 6], shape=[2], dtype=tf.int32)
min = tf.constant(80.22522735595703)
max = tf.constant(80.39215850830078)

tf.raw_ops.QuantizedResizeBilinear(images=images, size=size, min=min, max=max,
                                   align_corners=True, half_pixel_centers=True)
```
This code highlights how specific combinations of input values can trigger the vulnerability, especially when `align_corners` and `half_pixel_centers` are set to True, which is necessary for the bug to be exploitable.

The fix introduces a check that enforces that the lower bound (`interpolation->lower[i]`) is less or equal to the upper bound `interpolation->upper[i]`:
```c++
interpolation->lower[i] = std::max(static_cast<int64>(in_f), static_cast<int64>(0));
interpolation->upper[i] = std::min(static_cast<int64>(std::ceil(in)), in_size - 1);
interpolation->lower[i] = std::min(interpolation->lower[i], interpolation->upper[i]);
```
This ensures the lower bound is capped by the upper bound, preventing the out-of-bounds access.

The affected versions are < 2.5.0. Patched versions include 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
