The provided content is related to CVE-2021-29515.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `MatrixDiag*` operations in TensorFlow do not validate if the tensor arguments are non-empty before accessing their values. Specifically, it directly accesses the first element of the tensors representing `num_rows`, `num_cols`, and `padding_value` using `.flat<T>()(0)` without checking if the tensors are valid and not null.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input validation on tensor arguments within the `MatrixDiag*` operations.
- Potential for null pointer dereference when empty tensors are passed as arguments.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A user can trigger a null pointer dereference, potentially crashing the TensorFlow application or leading to other undefined behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could craft a TensorFlow graph or directly call the `tf.raw_ops.MatrixDiagV2` or `tf.raw_ops.MatrixDiagV3` operations with empty tensors as arguments for `num_rows`, `num_cols`, or `padding_value`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to construct and execute TensorFlow operations.
- No special privileges or access is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
The provided GitHub content includes the commit that fixes the vulnerability. The fix involves adding checks to ensure that the tensors for `num_rows`, `num_cols` and `padding_value` are not empty and are valid scalars using `TensorShapeUtils::IsScalar` before accessing their values.
