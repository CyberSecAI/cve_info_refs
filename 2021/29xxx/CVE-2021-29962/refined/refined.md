Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-29962:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the lack of rate-limiting for `window.open()` calls in Firefox for Android. This allows a malicious website to open a large number of pop-up prompts very quickly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Lack of rate-limiting:** Firefox for Android did not limit the number of pop-up windows that a website could open, unlike the desktop version which uses tab-modal prompts and doesn't stack prompts.
- **Non-modal pop-up prompts:** The pop-up prompts in Fenix (Firefox for Android) are non-modal and stack, unlike the tab-modal prompts used in the desktop version, which prevents the user from easily dismissing the prompts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious website could open numerous pop-up prompts, making the Fenix UI unresponsive, effectively locking the user out of the browser.
- **Difficult Recovery:**  The DoS condition is difficult to recover from.  Switching tabs, reloading the page, or even terminating the process might not resolve it. Restarting the browser restores the malicious page and re-triggers the DoS. Users could only escape using developer tools.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Website:** An attacker crafts a web page that uses `window.open()` calls in rapid succession to generate multiple pop-up prompts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker only needs the ability to host a web page.
- No special privileges are needed. The attack is executed within the standard web browsing environment.
- The attacker must entice a user to visit the malicious web page using Firefox for Android.

**Additional Information:**

- The fix for this issue involved implementing a mechanism to show only one pop-up at a time and to provide a prompt abuse detector that prevents the page from opening further prompts.
- The vulnerability is specific to Firefox for Android (Fenix), as the desktop version handles popups differently.
- The fix was implemented in Firefox 89.
- The bug was classified as "sec-low" severity.
