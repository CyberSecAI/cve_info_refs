- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SSH server configuration shipped with IBM Tivoli Netcool/Impact 7.1.0.20 and 7.1.0.21 uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Use of weak cryptographic algorithms in the SSH server configuration.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The bulletin does not specify the exact impact beyond the fact that weaker algorithms are in use, but potentially exposes the system to man-in-the-middle attacks or unauthorized access. The severity will depend on the deployed environment.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks targeting the SSH server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to the vulnerable SSH service.
