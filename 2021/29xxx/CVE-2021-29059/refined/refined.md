Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29059:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the `is-svg` npm package. It stems from inefficient regular expressions used within the `removeDtdMarkupDeclarations` and `entityRegex` functions. The fix for CVE-2021-28092 was bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inefficient Regular Expressions:** The core issue lies in the use of vulnerable regular expressions that can lead to catastrophic backtracking when processing specifically crafted input strings.  The following sub-regexes were found to be problematic:
    *   `[A-Z]+` and `[^>]*` in `removeDtdMarkupDeclarations`
    *   `\s*` , `\s+\S*\s*`, and `\S*\s*(?:"|')[^"]+` in `entityRegex`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing specially crafted SVG strings or buffers to the `is-svg` library. Processing such malicious input would take an excessive amount of time, potentially leading to resource exhaustion and making the application or service unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the input string provided to the `isSvg` function. By crafting malicious strings with a specific pattern based on the vulnerable regex, an attacker can trigger the ReDoS vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted string to the `isSvg` function. This can occur in various scenarios depending on how the `is-svg` package is integrated into an application. This could be through user input, data parsing, or any other situation where the library is used to process untrusted data.

**Technical Details:**

The provided proof-of-concept code demonstrates four different attack vectors, each exploiting a different part of the vulnerable regular expressions:

1.  **First ReDoS:** Targets `removeDtdMarkupDeclarations` by repeatedly adding `DOCTYPE` strings within the input.
2.  **Second ReDoS:** Targets `entityRegex` with a long string of spaces.
3.  **Third ReDoS:** Targets `entityRegex` with a string starting with `<!Entity` followed by many spaces.
4.  **Fourth ReDoS:** Targets `entityRegex` with a string starting with `<!Entity ` followed by many single quotes.

The exploit code shows how the execution time increases significantly with the length of the attack string, demonstrating the ReDoS vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.3.0 of the `is-svg` package, as indicated in the GitHub commit link provided in the content.

In summary, CVE-2021-29059 is a ReDoS vulnerability in the `is-svg` package exploitable by providing specific malicious strings that cause the vulnerable regular expressions to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
