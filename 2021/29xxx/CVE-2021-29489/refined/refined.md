{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The chart options structure in Highcharts versions 8 and earlier was not systematically filtered for XSS vectors.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unfiltered HTML string options being inserted directly into the DOM, especially when using the `useHTML` flag. When `useHTML` was false, malicious code could be inserted by using various character replacement tricks or malformed HTML.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could execute code in the end user's browser by inserting malicious code through the chart options structure.",
  "Attack vectors": "Untrusted content from external sources, especially if HTML markup is used in the configuration and inserted unfiltered into the DOM.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to control or inject malicious HTML code into the chart options structure, especially when the `useHTML` flag is used or when the HTML is malformed or contains character replacement tricks."
