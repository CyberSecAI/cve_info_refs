Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a missing bounds check on the `axis` attribute in the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV3` operation. The code uses this user-supplied `axis` value to index into the dimensions of the input tensor, but doesn't ensure that `axis` is a valid index.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The missing bounds check allows an attacker to provide an `axis` value that is larger than the number of dimensions of the input tensor. This leads to an out-of-bounds read of heap memory during the `input.dim_size(axis_)` operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information disclosure:** By controlling the `axis` value, an attacker can read arbitrary data from the heap, which can lead to information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV3` operation by providing a carefully crafted `axis` attribute that leads to out-of-bounds access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to call the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV3` operation and provide arbitrary values for the `axis` parameter. This assumes that the attacker can supply inputs to the Tensorflow model.

**Additional details:**
*   The provided code snippet shows an example of how to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The patch introduces a check using `OP_REQUIRES` to ensure that `axis_` is less than the number of dimensions of the input tensor.
*   The vulnerability is considered "Low" severity.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
*   The fix was included in TensorFlow versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
