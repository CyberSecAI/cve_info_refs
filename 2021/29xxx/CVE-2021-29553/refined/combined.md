# Heap OOB in `QuantizeAndDequantizeV3`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-h9px-9vqg-222h
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can read data outside of bounds of heap allocated buffer in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV3`:

```
import tensorflow as tf

tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV3(
  input=[2.5,2.5], input_min=[0,0], input_max=[1,1], num_bits=[30],
  signed_input=False, range_given=False, narrow_range=False, axis=3)
```

This is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/11ff7f80667e6490d7b5174aa6bf5e01886e770f/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.cc#L237) does not validate the value of user supplied `axis` attribute before using it to index in the array backing the `input` argument:

```
const int depth = (axis_ == -1) ? 1 : input.dim_size(axis_);
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [99085e8ff02c3763a0ec2263e44daec416f6a387](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/99085e8ff02c3763a0ec2263e44daec416f6a387).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-29553

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
