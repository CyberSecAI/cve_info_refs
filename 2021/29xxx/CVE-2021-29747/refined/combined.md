# Security Bulletin: IBM InfoSphere DataStage is affected by an Information disclosure vulnerability

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

An Information disclosure vulnerability in IBM InfoSphere DataStage was addressed.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2021-29747](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-29747)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| InfoSphere Information Server | 11.7 |

## Remediation/Fixes

None, see mitigation.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

* Depending on your installation type, you may already have the DataStage Operations Console disabled by default; in such an installation, the vulnerability cannot be exploited.
* When accessing the web based DataStage Operations Console ensure that only trusted networks are used where the network traffic cannot be tampered in any way.
* If not needed, disable the DataStage Operations Console by issuing the following commands on the DataStage Server:

       cd /opt//IBM/InformationServer/Server/DSODB

       sed ‐i.bak -e ‘/DSODBON=1/s/=.\*/=0/’ DSODBConfig.cfg

       ./bin/DSAppWatcher.sh -status
* The DataStage Operations Console uses data stored in the DSODB database. After disabling the console you can still obtain information that is displayed in the console by connecting directly to the DSODB database and running specific queries. You can find information on the operations database schema at <https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/iis/11.7?topic=database-operations>
