Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29617:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `tf.strings.substr` function within the TensorFlow library. It arises due to a lack of proper validation for the `pos` (position) argument when it contains invalid values such as negative indices or indices exceeding the string length. This lack of validation leads to a `CHECK`-fail.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient input validation for the `pos` argument in the `tf.strings.substr` function.
- Failure to handle cases where the `pos` argument contains negative indices or indices that are out of bounds of the input string.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing invalid `pos` arguments to the `tf.strings.substr` function, resulting in a crash due to the `CHECK`-fail.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves calling the `tf.strings.substr` function with a crafted `pos` argument.
- The attacker can control the values in `pos` and therefore trigger the crash using specially crafted inputs, such as `pos=[1, -1]` or `pos=[1, 2]`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code that uses the TensorFlow library.
- The attacker needs to be able to control the arguments passed to `tf.strings.substr`, especially the `pos` argument.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is fixed in TensorFlow versions 2.5.0 and also backported to 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
- The fix is associated with the GitHub commit [890f7164b70354c57d40eda52dcdd7658677c09f](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/890f7164b70354c57d40eda52dcdd7658677c09f).
- The GitHub commit shows the addition of a check for the shape of the `pos` and `len` tensors and provides test cases that fail with invalid `pos` values, thus addressing the vulnerability.
