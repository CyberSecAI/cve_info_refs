Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29726:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper validation of certificates. Specifically, the affected products do not properly ensure that a certificate is actually associated with the host.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Certificate Validation: The core issue is the lack of proper verification that a certificate belongs to the intended host.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The provided documents do not explicitly describe the impact of successful exploitation beyond the general statement of improper certificate validation. However, it can be inferred that successful exploitation could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks or impersonation where a malicious actor can use a certificate not meant for the service to gain access or intercept traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting the lack of proper certificate validation when the software is processing certificates.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would likely need to be in a position to present a certificate to the vulnerable software or control the certificate validation process in order to exploit this vulnerability.
- Specific requirements are not detailed, however it can be assumed that the attacker would need the ability to introduce or manipulate network traffic or somehow influence the certificate presented to the server.

- IBM Sterling External Authentication Server version 6.0.3
- IBM Sterling Secure Proxy version 6.0.3

**Fixes:**
- iFix 3 for IBM Sterling External Authentication Server 6.0.3.0
