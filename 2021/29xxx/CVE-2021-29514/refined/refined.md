The content relates to CVE-2021-29514.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a missing check in the `RaggedBincount` operation in TensorFlow. Specifically, if the `splits` argument does not specify a valid `SparseTensor` (i.e., the first element of `splits` is not 0, or the last element is not equal to the number of values), it leads to out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow due to an out-of-bounds write.
- Improper validation of the `splits` argument in `RaggedBincount`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow by providing maliciously crafted input to the `RaggedBincount` operation.
- This out-of-bounds write can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `RaggedBincount` operation in TensorFlow.
- By providing a crafted `splits` argument that does not specify a valid `SparseTensor`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to call the `tf.raw_ops.RaggedBincount` operation with crafted inputs.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the required inputs to trigger the overflow.
