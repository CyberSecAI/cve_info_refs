Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-29628:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the implementation of Supervisor Mode Access Prevention (SMAP) in the FreeBSD kernel.
- When a page fault occurs during a copyin() or copyout() operation (which disables SMAP temporarily), and the fault is deemed invalid, the kernel's page fault handler incorrectly leaves SMAP disabled until the thread returns to user mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SMAP Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the bypass of SMAP protection. SMAP is intended to prevent the kernel from directly accessing user memory, and the bug allows the kernel to operate with SMAP disabled longer than intended.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Modification:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to read or write to user memory from the kernel, potentially leading to data addition or modification.
- **Privilege Escalation:** This vulnerability can be combined with other kernel bugs to craft a more effective exploit.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered within the kernel during copy operations between user and kernel space, specifically when an invalid page fault occurs and SMAP is not re-enabled.
- The attacker would need to trigger a system call that involves data copying and manipulation that can lead to an invalid page fault, which will then leave SMAP disabled for an extended duration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have the ability to make system calls to trigger the vulnerable code path.
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the kernel's page fault handling mechanism, specifically to trigger an invalid fault.

**Additional Notes:**
- The NetApp advisory states that no NetApp products are affected by this vulnerability.
- The FreeBSD advisory provides details on how to patch the vulnerability, either via binary or source code updates.
- The vulnerability affects FreeBSD versions 12.2 and later.
