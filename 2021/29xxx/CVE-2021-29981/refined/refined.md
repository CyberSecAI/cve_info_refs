Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29981:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in the JIT compiler's lowering/register allocation phase, specifically related to how it handles live range splitting. When an instruction reuses the same input for its output and that input is a constant, the register allocator can incorrectly assign registers, leading to a conflict. This conflict occurs because the register allocator fails to properly account for scenarios where a single MIR node can map to multiple LIR nodes due to `emitAtUses`. This is especially true for operations like multiplication where the same input operand is used twice.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Register Assignment:** The core issue is the potential for the register allocator to assign the same register to two distinct values that have overlapping lifetimes, leading to register confusion.
*   **Improper Handling of Constants:** The JIT compiler incorrectly treats constant values that are used as inputs for operations, specifically in situations where the same constant value is used as both operands for an instruction, such as multiplication, leading to the creation of multiple LIR nodes for a single MIR node.
*   **Flawed Live Range Splitting:** The splitting logic within the register allocator does not properly account for the reuse of input values as output values of instructions, resulting in overlapping ranges and incorrect register allocations.
*   **Misuse of `useRegisterAtStart`:**  The use of `useRegisterAtStart` for both operands of a multiplication, when one of them is a constant, can lead to the assignment of the same register for different values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exploitable Crash:** The register confusion results in memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash due to an assertion failure, where the output register of a definition does not match its allocated register.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potential):** Although the exact method for exploitation isn't explicitly stated, the memory corruption caused by the incorrect register allocation has the potential to be leveraged for arbitrary code execution, which is a high-severity security risk.
*   **Deterministic Failures:** The register confusion failures are deterministic, meaning that they will occur predictably if a specific sequence of instructions is triggered with the vulnerable configuration.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Although initially discovered on ARM64, the vulnerability is present across other platforms (x86, x64) due to the nature of the register allocation issue and can be triggered using 32-bit operands as well.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **WebAssembly (Wasm):** The vulnerability was discovered through a test case using WebAssembly, indicating that an attacker could potentially trigger this bug by crafting malicious Wasm code.
*   **JIT-Triggered Code:** The vulnerability lies within the JIT compiler, meaning any code that gets JIT compiled is a potential vector, though this is most easily triggered through crafted Wasm code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Generate Malicious Wasm Code (or other JIT compilable code):** Attackers need to be able to craft Wasm code (or other code that uses JIT compilation) that triggers the specific conditions required for the register allocation error.
*   **Execution in a JIT-Enabled Context:** The vulnerable code needs to run within a context that utilizes the JIT compiler (e.g. a web browser, or a wasm runtime).

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is related to the specific interactions between MIR nodes, LIR nodes, and the register allocation algorithm during the lowering phase of the JIT.
*   The bug is not a result of a flaw specific to `int64`, although it was initially encountered during the handling of `int64` multiplication.
*   The core issue is that during register allocation, the allocator failed to recognize that two values could not reside in the same register at the same time, leading to an incorrect register assignment.
*   The fix involved a change to how register selection is handled during the lowering process, specifically when dealing with reused inputs and constants. The fix included more subtle equality checks on `MDefinition` objects during lowering to account for cases where the MIR node can map to more than one LIR node due to constant values and `emitAtUses`.
