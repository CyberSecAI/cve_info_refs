The content relates to CVE-2021-29326.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `fxIDToString` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow in `fxIDToString` function.
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) code triggers a write of 3349 bytes to a heap region allocated with a size of 1456 bytes causing the overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The heap-buffer-overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service by corrupting the heap memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by executing a specifically crafted JavaScript payload (provided in the PoC).
- The vulnerability can be triggered when evaluating JavaScript code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute malicious JavaScript code.
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted javascript payload as an input.
