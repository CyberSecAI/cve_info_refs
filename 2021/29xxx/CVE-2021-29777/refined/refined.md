Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability occurs in IBM Db2 when a table is dropped while another session is actively accessing it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A race condition or improper synchronization during table drop operations while being accessed by another session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS). An authenticated user can cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An authenticated user must initiate the table drop operation while another session is actively accessing the same table.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the IBM Db2 environment.
- They need to be able to initiate a table drop operation.
- They need to know when another session is accessing the table to create the race condition.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all fix pack levels of IBM Db2 V9.7, V10.1, V10.5, V11.1, and V11.5 editions on all platforms.
- IBM has provided special builds containing interim fixes for this issue which are based on the most recent fix pack level for each impacted release, and they can be applied to any affected fixpack level of the appropriate release to remediate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is also present in NetApp products that incorporate the vulnerable versions of IBM DB2, but the NetApp advisory states that none of their products are currently affected.
