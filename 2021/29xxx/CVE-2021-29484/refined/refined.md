Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-29484:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from an unused endpoint (`/ghost/preview`) in the Ghost CMS admin panel that was introduced during the development of version 4.0.0. This endpoint is a static HTML page that renders content based on messages received through the `postMessage` API.
- The `message` event handler in the preview page does not validate the origin of the messages it receives, leading to a DOM-based XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The preview page uses `document.write(message.data)` to render the content of received messages without sanitization or origin validation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.
- **Lack of Origin Validation:** The `message` event handler does not verify the origin of the incoming messages, allowing messages from any source to be processed.
- **Embeddable Preview Page:** The `/ghost/preview` page does not have `X-Frame-Options` or `frame-ancestors` directives in the CSP header, allowing it to be embedded in an iframe on any website, including attacker-controlled websites.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Admin Account Takeover:** An attacker can lure a logged-in Ghost admin user to a malicious website containing an embedded preview page and malicious JavaScript injected via the `postMessage` API.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The injected JavaScript can perform actions within the context of the logged-in admin user, such as creating a new admin account for the attacker.
- **Full Site Control:** Once an attacker gains admin access, they can read or modify any data on the site, including content, settings, and user information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack is conducted over the network. The attacker hosts a malicious webpage.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires a logged-in Ghost admin to visit a malicious link or website controlled by the attacker.
- **Cross-Origin Messaging:** The vulnerability leverages the `postMessage` API to send malicious content to the vulnerable preview page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to create and host a malicious website.
- The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in Ghost admin user to visit this malicious website.
- The attacker needs to understand how the `postMessage` API works to send malicious code to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was present in Ghost versions 4.0.0 through 4.3.2.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.3.3 by removing the vulnerable endpoint.
*   A workaround for self-hosted instances was to block access to the `/ghost/preview` endpoint.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Paul Gerste of SonarSource.
*   The CVSS score is 7.6 (High)
*   CVSS vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N

This vulnerability allows a low privileged user to perform an attack that impacts other components within the system.
