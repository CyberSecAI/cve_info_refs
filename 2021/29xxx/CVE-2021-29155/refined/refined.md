    {
        "CVE ID": "CVE-2021-29155",
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Extended BPF (eBPF) verifier did not completely protect against information leaks due to speculative execution. Specifically, when protecting sequences of pointer arithmetic operations against speculatively out-of-bounds loads, the pointer modification performed by the first operation is not correctly accounted for when restricting subsequent operations.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
            "Incomplete protection against information leaks due to speculative execution",
             "Bypass of pointer arithmetic protection",
            "Speculatively out-of-bounds loads"
        ],
        "Impact of exploitation": "A local user could exploit these to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.",
        "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation using a crafted eBPF program.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user with the ability to load eBPF programs."
