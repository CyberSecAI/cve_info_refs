- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Resilient App Host uses higher permissions than required for containers hosted on it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability stems from overly permissive settings in the Resilient App Host, allowing hosted containers to potentially access resources or operations beyond their necessary scope.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious application could exploit these excessive permissions. The specific impact is not detailed, but could potentially include unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other malicious activities within the host environment.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attack vector involves a malicious application deployed within a container hosted on the vulnerable Resilient App Host.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deploy and run a malicious container on the Resilient App Host.
