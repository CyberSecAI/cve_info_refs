Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29605:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow in the `TfLiteIntArrayGetSizeInBytes` function within TensorFlow Lite's C API. This function calculates the memory size required for a `TfLiteIntArray` based on a provided size.
- The calculation `sizeof(dummy) + sizeof(dummy.data[0]) * size` can overflow the `int` datatype if `size` is sufficiently large, resulting in a negative value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The core weakness is the lack of proper input validation or overflow handling in the size calculation.
- **Heap Overflow (Potential):** While the advisory states that a negative size is given to `malloc` which then results in an invalid dereference, the allocation of a small memory buffer could also be a heap overflow in some implementations of `malloc`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Invalid Memory Access:**  A negative size passed to `malloc` could result in allocation of a small buffer or an invalid pointer. This leads to dereferencing an invalid memory location when the `ret->size = size;` is executed in the `TfLiteIntArrayCreate` function. This causes crashes, or possibly opens the door for more complicated attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Model:** An attacker crafts a TensorFlow Lite model with a specific `size` parameter such that when `TfLiteIntArrayGetSizeInBytes` is called the integer overflow occurs.
- The model is then loaded and used by a vulnerable application using TensorFlow Lite.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious TensorFlow Lite model. This requires the attacker to have a position where the model would be used by the target application.
- No other specific capabilities are detailed in the provided information.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was patched in commit `7c8cc4ec69cd348e44ad6a2699057ca88faad3e5`.
- Patches were included in TensorFlow versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
- The issue was reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
