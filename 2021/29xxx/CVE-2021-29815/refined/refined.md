- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization, which allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI. This can lead to the alteration of intended functionality and potential disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of the application by injecting malicious JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to input data that can be stored and later displayed to other users of the web application.
