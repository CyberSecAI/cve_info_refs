# XSS in doc\_link

Moderate

[vrana](/vrana)
published
GHSA-2v82-5746-vwqc
May 15, 2021

## Package

all

## Affected versions

4.7.8 to 4.8.0

## Patched versions

4.8.1

## Description

### Impact

Users of MySQL, MariaDB, PgSQL and SQLite are affected. XSS is in most cases prevented by strict CSP in all modern browsers. The only exception is when Adminer is using a `pdo_` extension to communicate with the database (it is used if the native extensions are not enabled). In browsers without CSP, Adminer versions 4.6.1 to 4.8.0 are affected.

### Patches

Patched by [4043092](https://github.com/vrana/adminer/commit/4043092ec2c0de2258d60a99d0c5958637d051a7), included in version [4.8.1](https://github.com/vrana/adminer/releases/tag/v4.8.1).

### Workarounds

Do both:

* Use browser supporting strict CSP.
* Enable the native PHP extensions (e.g. `mysqli`) or disable displaying PHP errors (`display_errors`).

### References

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-29625

### Weaknesses
