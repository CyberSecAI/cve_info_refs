The provided content relates to CVE-2021-29625.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `doc_link` function within `adminer/include/editing.inc.php`. This function generates HTML links based on provided paths and URLs related to documentation.
- The vulnerability occurs because the function does not properly escape the URL parameters, allowing for the injection of malicious code within the `href` attribute.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- Improper neutralization of input during web page generation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the generated HTML link.
- When a user clicks the crafted link, the malicious JavaScript could be executed within their browser, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other unauthorized actions.
- The impact is mitigated by browsers with a strict Content Security Policy (CSP).
- The vulnerability is more easily exploitable when using a `pdo_` extension to communicate with the database, and when PHP errors are displayed.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted URLs that are used as a documentation link.
- The attacker would need to find a way to insert a malicious URL that calls the `doc_link` function, which then constructs the vulnerable HTML.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the `paths` parameters passed to the `doc_link` function, specifically, the `jush` parameter.
- The attacker also needs to have access to a vulnerable Adminer instance running a vulnerable version.
- The attacker would rely on users clicking the malicious links.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Adminer versions 4.7.8 to 4.8.0.
- The vulnerability is patched in version 4.8.1 via commit [4043092](https://github.com/vrana/adminer/commit/4043092ec2c0de2258d60a99d0c5958637d051a7) which modifies `adminer/include/editing.inc.php` to properly escape the URL.
- Workarounds include using a browser with strict CSP, enabling native PHP extensions, or disabling PHP error display.
