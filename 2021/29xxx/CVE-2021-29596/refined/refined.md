Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-29596

**Root Cause:**
- Division by zero error in the TFLite's `EmbeddingLookup` operator implementation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The code calculates `row_bytes` by dividing `value->bytes` by `row_size`.
- The `row_size` is determined by `SizeOfDimension(value, 0)`, which can be 0 if the first dimension of the `value` input is zero.
- This leads to a division by zero error when `row_size` is 0.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  A division-by-zero error can occur which could lead to a crash or unexpected behavior of the application using TensorFlow Lite.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious TFLite model where the first dimension of the `value` input to the `EmbeddingLookup` operator is zero.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a TFLite model and have it processed by a vulnerable version of TensorFlow Lite.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects TensorFlow Lite versions prior to 2.5.0.
- Patches were backported to versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
- The fix implemented in the provided commit adds a check to handle the case where `row_size` is 0, preventing the division by zero error.
- The vulnerability was reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
