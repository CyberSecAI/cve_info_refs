- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Esri ArcGIS Server Services Directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application allows a remote, authenticated attacker to store malicious strings within the ArcGIS Services Directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser of a user interacting with the application.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker must be authenticated to the application to inject malicious strings. Then the attacker needs a user to interact with the malicious content to execute the script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires a valid account to access the ArcGIS Server Services Directory application.
