Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-29624:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of protection against "cookie tossing" attacks in the `fastify-csrf` library when using the "double submit" mechanism with cookies. This occurs when an application is deployed across multiple subdomains.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient CSRF Protection:** The "double submit cookie" method, when not properly implemented, is susceptible to cookie tossing attacks where an attacker can manipulate cookies on subdomains to bypass CSRF protection.
- **Lack of Domain Binding:** The core issue is that the CSRF token was not sufficiently tied to the user's session or the specific subdomain, allowing an attacker on a different subdomain to potentially forge a valid token.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery:** An attacker can potentially perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a victim user. This is done by crafting requests that include a forged but valid CSRF token derived from a different subdomain.
- **Data Integrity Loss:** Successful exploitation can lead to changes in data or state that the attacker is not authorized to perform, compromising the integrity of the application and user data.
- **Account Takeover Risk:** Depending on application functionality, an attacker could potentially perform actions such as making purchases, changing passwords or any other action the victim user has privileges to do.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network, typically by enticing a victim user to interact with a malicious resource or link.
- **Cross-Subdomain Attack:** The attack relies on the ability of an attacker to control or influence a subdomain that shares cookies with the target application.
- **User Interaction:** The victim user needs to be authenticated and then tricked into performing an action or visiting a resource controlled by an attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to manipulate or control subdomains:** An attacker needs to have control over at least one subdomain sharing the same base domain as the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of target application:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the application's functionality to craft a successful attack.
- **Ability to induce user interaction:** The attacker has to be able to get the victim user to trigger the malicious action, which often implies some social engineering or tricking the user into clicking a link or visiting a malicious site.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in `fastify-csrf` version 3.1.0.
- The fix involves requiring users to supply `userInfo` when generating a CSRF token, particularly for applications hosted on different subdomains. This ties the token to the user and the context preventing cookie tossing.
- The `userInfo` is hashed inside the CSRF token and it is not exposed directly to public.
- The OWASP Cross-Site Request Forgery Prevention Cheat Sheet is referenced as a relevant resource.
