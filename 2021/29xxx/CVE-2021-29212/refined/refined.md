- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path within the backup endpoint before it's used in file operations. This allows for directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability due to insufficient input validation of the user-provided path.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of root on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is reachable through a network connection, specifically via the backup endpoint. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and does not need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
