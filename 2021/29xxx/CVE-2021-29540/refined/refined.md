The provided content relates to CVE-2021-29540.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect calculation of the filter tensor size in the `Conv2DBackpropFilter` operation. The implementation computes the size of the filter tensor based on `filter_sizes` dimensions but doesn't validate that this computed size matches the actual number of elements in `filter_sizes`. This leads to a heap buffer overflow when the code attempts to read or write to this buffer using the computed (incorrect) size.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow: Due to the incorrect size calculation, a buffer overflow can occur when writing to the filter tensor, leading to memory corruption.
- Lack of input validation: The code doesn't validate if the computed filter size matches the number of elements in the `filter_sizes` tensor.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow leading to potential denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or information disclosure.
- Memory corruption during tensor operations.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting specific input tensors and filter sizes, an attacker can trigger the vulnerable code path in `tf.raw_ops.Conv2DBackpropFilter`.
- Specifically, providing a `filter_sizes` tensor that does not match the expected size causes the issue.
- Empty tensors passed to `tf.raw_ops.Conv2DBackpropFilter` also expose the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute TensorFlow code and construct input tensors with specific properties that trigger the vulnerability.
- There is no required position, as any user that can execute the TensorFlow code is able to trigger this.
