# Unauthenticated GET requests through Remote Image endpoints

Moderate

[joshuaboniface](/joshuaboniface)
published
GHSA-rgjw-4fwc-9v96
May 5, 2021

## Package

Jellyfin

## Affected versions

<10.7.2

## Patched versions

10.7.3

## Description

### Impact

The API endpoints `/Images/Remote?imageUrl=<URL>`, `/Items/RemoteSearch/Image?ImageUrl=<URL>&ProviderName=TheMovieDB`, and `/Items/{itemId}/RemoteImages/Download` are vulnerable to unauthenticated Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks via the imageUrl parameter. This issue potentially exposes both internal and external HTTP servers or other resources available via HTTP `GET` that are visible from the Jellyfin server.

This allows:

##### Information Disclosure and Exfiltration

This was previously identified as an issue. Requests for images that are unauthenticated can lead to the leak of all existing images in the server. However, this isn't limited to just images. Any resource that can be obtained via an HTTP request on the local network of the webserver can be obtained remotely via this request.

##### Unauthenticated Access to Internal Network HTTP Servers

The SSRF attack can be leveraged to connect to any HTTP Server connected to the same network as the Jellyfin server, for instance an Nginx server exposed only internally, an internal RESTful API, such as a NoSQL database, or a GraphQL database. This is not limited just to services hosted on the local machine, but all the machines connected on the local network.

##### Port and IP Scanning and Enumeration

This vulnerability can be leveraged to port scan for HTTP servers both internal and external services on demand, as well as enumerating all the machines in the local network that have open HTTP ports.

### Patches

* Removal of requirement for both endpoints in the Web interface in [jellyfin/jellyfin-web#2645](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-web/pull/2645)
* Removal of API endpoints in this advisory PR and [#5957](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/pull/5957)

### Workarounds

* Disable external access to the API endpoints `/Items/*/RemoteImages/Download`, `/Items/RemoteSearch/Image` and `/Images/Remote` via reverse proxy, or limit to known-friendly IPs.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
