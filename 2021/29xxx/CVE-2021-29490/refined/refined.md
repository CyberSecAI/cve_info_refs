{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The API endpoints `/Images/Remote?imageUrl=<URL>`, `/Items/RemoteSearch/Image?ImageUrl=<URL>&ProviderName=TheMovieDB`, and `/Items/{itemId}/RemoteImages/Download` are vulnerable to unauthenticated Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks via the imageUrl parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to:\n- Leak all existing images in the server (information disclosure).\n- Obtain any resource via an HTTP request on the local network of the webserver.\n- Connect to any HTTP Server connected to the same network as the Jellyfin server.\n- Port scan for HTTP servers both internal and external.\n- Enumerate all the machines in the local network that have open HTTP ports.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the network via the vulnerable API endpoints by using a crafted URL in the `imageUrl` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be remote and does not need any privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. They only need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Jellyfin instance."
