Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-29945:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The WebAssembly JIT (Just-In-Time compiler) incorrectly calculates the size of a return type when dealing with multi-value returns, specifically when a function returns a float32 (f32) and another value (like a float64).
- This leads to insufficient stack space being allocated for the return values, causing a memory overwrite when the return values are written to the stack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect size computation:** The `MIRTypeToSize` function in the Ion compiler returns an incorrect size for float32 return values on x86 architectures.
- **Stack clobbering:** Due to the incorrect size, the return value overwrites part of the stack frame, specifically clobbering the saved TLS (Thread Local Storage) register.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Null read and crash:** The overwritten TLS register, when later read and used as a base pointer for an access, can lead to a null read and a crash.
- **Potential for memory access:** While not highly probable, the overwritten pointer could, in theory, be exploited to access memory using a large offset, if the pointer was used as the base for such access. This might be possible if the overwritten pointer is used as the base pointer for a large-offset access by engine or JIT-compiled code. However, the likelihood of this is described as "not very plausible".
- It could also clobber part of an int64 which may lead to bypassing integer range check in some cases

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious webpage can execute specifically crafted WebAssembly code that triggers a multi-value return with a combination of a float32 and another value on x86-32 platform.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a WebAssembly function calls out to JavaScript and returns multi-values with f32 as one of the return values.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to serve a webpage with malicious WebAssembly code that is processed by Firefox or Thunderbird, where JIT compilation of the wasm is enabled.
- The vulnerability is specific to x86-32 platforms.

**Additional Notes**
- This issue was initially marked as a crash, but it is considered a security issue because of the potential for exploitation, although difficult to achieve.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `ToWebAssemblyValue` function writes a float32 value to the stack when `mustWrite64` is true, resulting in overwriting an extra word (4 bytes) on the stack with zeros. This zeroing was introduced in a previous patch (bug 1673589).
- The patch fixes the size calculation of the return area on the stack by correctly calculating the slot size via `ABIResult`
- The vulnerability exists in Firefox versions 85 and later, and possibly in Thunderbird as well. It also affects Firefox ESR 78.
