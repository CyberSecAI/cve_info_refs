Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29518:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a null pointer dereference in the `GetSessionTensorOp` and `DeleteSessionTensorOp` within TensorFlow when operating in eager mode.
- In eager mode, session operations are invalid, and the `ctx->session_state()` pointer is null.
- The code directly dereferences this null pointer without a prior check when `GetTensor` or `DeleteTensor` are called, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is the dereferencing of a null `session_state` pointer.
- **Missing Input Validation:** The code lacks proper checks to ensure the session state is valid before accessing it, particularly within eager execution mode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Crash:** The immediate impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a program crash due to the null pointer dereference.
- **Denial of Service:** A malicious user can cause a denial-of-service by triggering the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector involves calling `tf.raw_ops.GetSessionTensor` or `tf.raw_ops.DeleteSessionTensor` in eager mode with specific input handles.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary TensorFlow code.
- The attacker must be using TensorFlow in eager mode (default in TF 2.0 and later).
- The attacker needs to craft the input handles to `GetSessionTensor` or `DeleteSessionTensor` to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided GitHub commit `ff70c47a396ef1e3cb73c90513da4f5cb71bebba` introduces a fix which checks if the `session_state` pointer is null before accessing it.
- The fix adds a check with `OP_REQUIRES(ctx, session_state != nullptr, ...)` before calling member functions of the session_state.
- Patched versions include 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2, and the fix is included in the 2.5.0 release.

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-29518 is a vulnerability caused by missing input validation that results in a null pointer dereference when specific raw operations are called in TensorFlow's eager mode. This can lead to program crashes and denial-of-service. The fix involves adding a check to ensure the session state is valid before using it, preventing the null pointer dereference.
