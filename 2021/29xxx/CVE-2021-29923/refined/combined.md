# Go: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **202208-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Go, the worst of which could result in remote code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/go** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.18.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.18.5** |

### Background

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Go. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Please review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Go users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/go-1.18.5"

```

In addition, users using Portage 3.0.9 or later should ensure that packages with Go binaries have no vulnerable code statically linked into their binaries by rebuilding the @golang-rebuild set:

```
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose @golang-rebuild

```

### Overview [¶](#pkg-overview "Go to Overview")

* [Name Resolution](#hdr-Name_Resolution)

Package net provides a portable interface for network I/O, including
TCP/IP, UDP, domain name resolution, and Unix domain sockets.

Although the package provides access to low-level networking
primitives, most clients will need only the basic interface provided
by the [Dial](#Dial), [Listen](#Listen), and Accept functions and the associated
[Conn](#Conn) and [Listener](#Listener) interfaces. The crypto/tls package uses
the same interfaces and similar Dial and Listen functions.

The Dial function connects to a server:

```
conn, err := net.Dial("tcp", "golang.org:80")
if err != nil {
	// handle error
}
fmt.Fprintf(conn, "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n")
status, err := bufio.NewReader(conn).ReadString('\n')
// ...

```

The Listen function creates servers:

```
ln, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":8080")
if err != nil {
	// handle error
}
for {
	conn, err := ln.Accept()
	if err != nil {
		// handle error
	}
	go handleConnection(conn)
}

```
#### Name Resolution [¶](#hdr-Name_Resolution "Go to Name Resolution")

The method for resolving domain names, whether indirectly with functions like Dial
or directly with functions like [LookupHost](#LookupHost) and [LookupAddr](#LookupAddr), varies by operating system.

On Unix systems, the resolver has two options for resolving names.
It can use a pure Go resolver that sends DNS requests directly to the servers
listed in /etc/resolv.conf, or it can use a cgo-based resolver that calls C
library routines such as getaddrinfo and getnameinfo.

On Unix the pure Go resolver is preferred over the cgo resolver, because a blocked DNS
request consumes only a goroutine, while a blocked C call consumes an operating system thread.
When cgo is available, the cgo-based resolver is used instead under a variety of
conditions: on systems that do not let programs make direct DNS requests (OS X),
when the LOCALDOMAIN environment variable is present (even if empty),
when the RES\_OPTIONS or HOSTALIASES environment variable is non-empty,
when the ASR\_CONFIG environment variable is non-empty (OpenBSD only),
when /etc/resolv.conf or /etc/nsswitch.conf specify the use of features that the
Go resolver does not implement.

On all systems (except Plan 9), when the cgo resolver is being used
this package applies a concurrent cgo lookup limit to prevent the system
from running out of system threads. Currently, it is limited to 500 concurrent lookups.

The resolver decision can be overridden by setting the netdns value of the
GODEBUG environment variable (see package runtime) to go or cgo, as in:

```
export GODEBUG=netdns=go    # force pure Go resolver
export GODEBUG=netdns=cgo   # force native resolver (cgo, win32)

```

The decision can also be forced while building the Go source tree
by setting the netgo or netcgo build tag.

A numeric netdns setting, as in GODEBUG=netdns=1, causes the resolver
to print debugging information about its decisions.
To force a particular resolver while also printing debugging information,
join the two settings by a plus sign, as in GODEBUG=netdns=go+1.

The Go resolver will send an EDNS0 additional header with a DNS request,
to signal a willingness to accept a larger DNS packet size.
This can reportedly cause sporadic failures with the DNS server run
by some modems and routers. Setting GODEBUG=netedns0=0 will disable
sending the additional header.

On macOS, if Go code that uses the net package is built with
-buildmode=c-archive, linking the resulting archive into a C program
requires passing -lresolv when linking the C code.

On Plan 9, the resolver always accesses /net/cs and /net/dns.

On Windows, in Go 1.18.x and earlier, the resolver always used C
library functions, such as GetAddrInfo and DnsQuery.

Well-known IPv6 addresses

[View Source](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/lookup.go;l=128)
```
var DefaultResolver = &[Resolver](#Resolver){}
```

DefaultResolver is the resolver used by the package-level Lookup
functions and by Dialers without a specified Resolver.

var ErrClosed [error](/builtin#error) = errClosed
```

ErrClosed is the error returned by an I/O call on a network
connection that has already been closed, or that is closed by
another goroutine before the I/O is completed. This may be wrapped
in another error, and should normally be tested using
errors.Is(err, net.ErrClosed).

### Functions [¶](#pkg-functions "Go to Functions")

#### func [JoinHostPort](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/ipsock.go;l=236) [¶](#JoinHostPort "Go to JoinHostPort")

```
func JoinHostPort(host, port [string](/builtin#string)) [string](/builtin#string)
```

JoinHostPort combines host and port into a network address of the
form "host:port". If host contains a colon, as found in literal
IPv6 addresses, then JoinHostPort returns "[host]:port".

See func Dial for a description of the host and port parameters.

#### func [LookupAddr](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/lookup.go;l=640) [¶](#LookupAddr "Go to LookupAddr")

```
func LookupAddr(addr [string](/builtin#string)) (names [][string](/builtin#string), err [error](/builtin#error))
```

LookupAddr performs a reverse lookup for the given address, returning a list
of names mapping to that address.

The returned names are validated to be properly formatted presentation-format
domain names. If the response contains invalid names, those records are filtered
out and an error will be returned alongside the remaining results, if any.

When using the host C library resolver, at most one result will be
returned. To bypass the host resolver, use a custom [Resolver](#Resolver).

LookupAddr uses [context.Background](/context#Background) internally; to specify the context, use
[Resolver.LookupAddr](#Resolver.LookupAddr).

#### func [LookupCNAME](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/lookup.go;l=451) [¶](#LookupCNAME "Go to LookupCNAME")

```
func LookupCNAME(host [string](/builtin#string)) (cname [string](/builtin#string), err [error](/builtin#error))
```

LookupCNAME returns the canonical name for the given host.
Callers that do not care about the canonical name can call
[LookupHost](#LookupHost) or [LookupIP](#LookupIP) directly; both take care of resolving
the canonical name as part of the lookup.

A canonical name is the final name after following zero
or more CNAME records.
LookupCNAME does not return an error if host does not
contain DNS "CNAME" records, as long as host resolves to
address records.

The returned canonical name is validated to be a properly
formatted presentation-format domain name.

LookupCNAME uses [context.Background](/context#Background) internally; to specify the context, use
[Resolver.LookupCNAME](#Resolver.LookupCNAME).

#### func [LookupHost](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/lookup.go;l=186) [¶](#LookupHost "Go to LookupHost")

```
func LookupHost(host [string](/builtin#string)) (addrs [][string](/builtin#string), err [error](/builtin#error))
```

LookupHost looks up the given host using the local resolver.
It returns a slice of that host's addresses.

LookupHost uses [context.Background](/context#Background) internally; to specify the context, use
[Resolver.LookupHost](#Resolver.LookupHost).

#### func [LookupPort](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/lookup.go;l=407) [¶](#LookupPort "Go to LookupPort")

```
func LookupPort(network, service [string](/builtin#string)) (port [int](/builtin#int), err [error](/builtin#error))
```

LookupPort looks up the port for the given network and service.

LookupPort uses [context.Background](/context#Background) internally; to specify the context, use
[Resolver.LookupPort](#Resolver.LookupPort).

#### func [LookupTXT](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/lookup.go;l=619) [¶](#LookupTXT "Go to LookupTXT")

```
func LookupTXT(name [string](/builtin#string)) ([][string](/builtin#string), [error](/builtin#error))
```

LookupTXT returns the DNS TXT records for the given domain name.

LookupTXT uses [context.Background](/context#Background) internally; to specify the context, use
[Resolver.LookupTXT](#Resolver.LookupTXT).

#### func [ParseCIDR](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/ip.go;l=519) [¶](#ParseCIDR "Go to ParseCIDR")

```
func ParseCIDR(s [string](/builtin#string)) ([IP](#IP), *[IPNet](#IPNet), [error](/builtin#error))
```

ParseCIDR parses s as a CIDR notation IP address and prefix length,
like "192.0.2.0/24" or "2001:db8::/32", as defined in
[RFC 4632](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4632.html) and [RFC 4291](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4291.html).

It returns the IP address and the network implied by the IP and
prefix length.
For example, ParseCIDR("192.0.2.1/24") returns the IP address
192.0.2.1 and the network 192.0.2.0/24.

Example [¶](#example-ParseCIDR "Go to Example")
```

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net"
)

func main() {
	ipv4Addr, ipv4Net, err := net.ParseCIDR("192.0.2.1/24")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(ipv4Addr)
	fmt.Println(ipv4Net)

	ipv6Addr, ipv6Net, err := net.ParseCIDR("2001:db8:a0b:12f0::1/32")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(ipv6Addr)
	fmt.Println(ipv6Net)

}

```
```
Output:

192.0.2.1
192.0.2.0/24
2001:db8:a0b:12f0::1
2001:db8::/32

```

#### func [Pipe](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/pipe.go;l=113) [¶](#Pipe "Go to Pipe")

```
func Pipe() ([Conn](#Conn), [Conn](#Conn))
```

Pipe creates a synchronous, in-memory, full duplex
network connection; both ends implement the [Conn](#Conn) interface.
Reads on one end are matched with writes on the other,
copying data directly between the two; there is no internal
buffering.

#### func [SplitHostPort](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/ipsock.go;l=165) [¶](#SplitHostPort "Go to SplitHostPort")

```
func SplitHostPort(hostport [string](/builtin#string)) (host, port [string](/builtin#string), err [error](/builtin#error))
```

SplitHostPort splits a network address of the form "host:port",
"host%zone:port", "[host]:port" or "[host%zone]:port" into host or
host%zone and port.

A literal IPv6 address in hostport must be enclosed in square
brackets, as in "[::1]:80", "[::1%lo0]:80".

See func Dial for a description of the hostport parameter, and host
and port results.

### Types [¶](#pkg-types "Go to Types")

#### type [Addr](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/net.go;l=111) [¶](#Addr "Go to Addr")

```
type Addr interface {
	Network() [string](/builtin#string) // name of the network (for example, "tcp", "udp")
	String() [string](/builtin#string)  // string form of address (for example, "192.0.2.1:25", "[2001:db8::1]:80")
}
```

Addr represents a network end point address.

The two methods [Addr.Network] and [Addr.String] conventionally return strings
that can be passed as the arguments to [Dial](#Dial), but the exact form
and meaning of the strings is up to the implementation.

```
type Buffers [][][byte](/builtin#byte)
```

Buffers contains zero or more runs of bytes to write.

On certain machines, for certain types of connections, this is
optimized into an OS-specific batch write operation (such as
"writev").

#### func (\*Buffers) [Read](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/net.go;l=863) [¶](#Buffers.Read "Go to Buffers.Read") added in go1.8

```
func (v *[Buffers](#Buffers)) Read(p [][byte](/builtin#byte)) (n [int](/builtin#int), err [error](/builtin#error))
```

Read from the buffers.

Read implements [io.Reader](/io#Reader) for [Buffers](#Buffers).

Read modifies the slice v as well as v[i] for 0 <= i < len(v),
but does not modify v[i][j] for any i, j.

#### func [Dial](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/dial.go;l=418) [¶](#Dial "Go to Dial")

```
func Dial(network, address [string](/builtin#string)) ([Conn](#Conn), [error](/builtin#error))
```

Dial connects to the address on the named network.

Known networks are "tcp", "tcp4" (IPv4-only), "tcp6" (IPv6-only),
"udp", "udp4" (IPv4-only), "udp6" (IPv6-only), "ip", "ip4"
(IPv4-only), "ip6" (IPv6-only), "unix", "unixgram" and
"unixpacket".

For TCP and UDP networks, the address has the form "host:port".
The host must be a literal IP address, or a host name that can be
resolved to IP addresses.
The port must be a literal port number or a service name.
If the host is a literal IPv6 address it must be enclosed in square
brackets, as in "[2001:db8::1]:80" or "[fe80::1%zone]:80".
The zone specifies the scope of the literal IPv6 address as defined
in [RFC 4007](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4007.html).
The functions [JoinHostPort](#JoinHostPort) and [SplitHostPort](#SplitHostPort) manipulate a pair of
host and port in this form.
When using TCP, and the host resolves to multiple IP addresses,
Dial will try each IP address in order until one succeeds.

Examples:

```
Dial("tcp", "golang.org:http")
Dial("tcp", "192.0.2.1:http")
Dial("tcp", "198.51.100.1:80")
Dial("udp", "[2001:db8::1]:domain")
Dial("udp", "[fe80::1%lo0]:53")
Dial("tcp", ":80")

```

For IP networks, the network must be "ip", "ip4" or "ip6" followed
by a colon and a literal protocol number or a protocol name, and
the address has the form "host". The host must be a literal IP
address or a literal IPv6 address with zone.
It depends on each operating system how the operating system
behaves with a non-well known protocol number such as "0" or "255".

Examples:

```
Dial("ip4:1", "192.0.2.1")
Dial("ip6:ipv6-icmp", "2001:db8::1")
Dial("ip6:58", "fe80::1%lo0")

```

For TCP, UDP and IP networks, if the host is empty or a literal
unspecified IP address, as in ":80", "0.0.0.0:80" or "[::]:80" for
TCP and UDP, "", "0.0.0.0" or "::" for IP, the local system is
assumed.

For Unix networks, the address must be a file system path.

#### func [DialTimeout](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/dial.go;l=433) [¶](#DialTimeout "Go to DialTimeout")

```
func DialTimeout(network, address [string](/builtin#string), timeout [time](/time).[Duration](/time#Duration)) ([Conn](#Conn), [error](/builtin#error))
```

DialTimeout acts like [Dial](#Dial) but takes a timeout.

The timeout includes name resolution, if required.
When using TCP, and the host in the address parameter resolves to
multiple IP addresses, the timeout is spread over each consecutive
dial, such that each is given an appropriate fraction of the time
to connect.

See func Dial for a description of the network and address
parameters.

#### func [FileConn](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/file.go;l=21) [¶](#FileConn "Go to FileConn")

```
func FileConn(f *[os](/os).[File](/os#File)) (c [Conn](#Conn), err [error](/builtin#error))
```

FileConn returns a copy of the network connection corresponding to
the open file f.
It is the caller's responsibility to close f when finished.
Closing c does not affect f, and closing f does not affect c.

```
func (e *[DNSError](#DNSError)) Temporary() [bool](/builtin#bool)
```

Temporary reports whether the DNS error is known to be temporary.
This is not always known; a DNS lookup may fail due to a temporary
error and return a [DNSError](#DNSError) for which Temporary returns false.

func (e *[DNSError](#DNSError)) Timeout() [bool](/builtin#bool)
```

Timeout reports whether the DNS lookup is known to have timed out.
This is not always known; a DNS lookup may fail due to a timeout
and return a [DNSError](#DNSError) for which Timeout returns false.

#### func (\*DNSError) [Unwrap](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/net.go;l=705) [¶](#DNSError.Unwrap "Go to DNSError.Unwrap") added in go1.23.0

```

A Dialer contains options for connecting to an address.

The zero value for each field is equivalent to dialing
without that option. Dialing with the zero value of Dialer
is therefore equivalent to just calling the [Dial](#Dial) function.

It is safe to call Dialer's methods concurrently.

```
func (d *[Dialer](#Dialer)) Dial(network, address [string](/builtin#string)) ([Conn](#Conn), [error](/builtin#error))
```

Dial connects to the address on the named network.

See func Dial for a description of the network and address
parameters.

Dial uses [context.Background](/context#Background) internally; to specify the context, use
[Dialer.DialContext](#Dialer.DialContext).

#### func (\*Dialer) [DialContext](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/dial.go;l=474) [¶](#Dialer.DialContext "Go to Dialer.DialContext") added in go1.7

```
func (d *[Dialer](#Dialer)) DialContext(ctx [context](/context).[Context](/context#Context), network, address [string](/builtin#string)) ([Conn](#Conn), [error](/builtin#error))
```

DialContext connects to the address on the named network using
the provided context.

The provided Context must be non-nil. If the context expires before
the connection is complete, an error is returned. Once successfully
connected, any expiration of the context will not affect the
connection.

When using TCP, and the host in the address parameter resolves to multiple
network addresses, any dial timeout (from d.Timeout or ctx) is spread
over each consecutive dial, such that each is given an appropriate
fraction of the time to connect.
For example, if a host has 4 IP addresses and the timeout is 1 minute,
the connect to each single address will be given 15 seconds to complete
before trying the next one.

See func [Dial](#Dial) for a description of the network and address
parameters.

```
func (d *[Dialer](#Dialer)) SetMultipathTCP(use [bool](/builtin#bool))
```

SetMultipathTCP directs the [Dial](#Dial) methods to use, or not use, MPTCP,
if supported by the operating system. This method overrides the
system default and the GODEBUG=multipathtcp=... setting if any.

If MPTCP is not available on the host or not supported by the server,
the Dial methods will fall back to TCP.

#### type [IP](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/ip.go;l=37) [¶](#IP "Go to IP")

```
type IP [][byte](/builtin#byte)
```

An IP is a single IP address, a slice of bytes.
Functions in this package accept either 4-byte (IPv4)
or 16-byte (IPv6) slices as input.

Note that in this documentation, referring to an
IP address as an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address
is a semantic property of the address, not just the
length of the byte slice: a 16-byte slice can still
be an IPv4 address.

Example (To4) [¶](#example-IP-To4 "Go to Example (To4)")
```

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net"
)

func main() {
	ipv6 := net.IP{0xfc, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
	ipv4 := net.IPv4(10, 255, 0, 0)

	fmt.Println(ipv6.To4())
	fmt.Println(ipv4.To4())

}

```

func LookupIP(host [string](/builtin#string)) ([][IP](#IP), [error](/builtin#error))
```

LookupIP looks up host using the local resolver.
It returns a slice of that host's IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

#### func [ParseIP](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/ip.go;l=496) [¶](#ParseIP "Go to ParseIP")

```
func ParseIP(s [string](/builtin#string)) [IP](#IP)
```

ParseIP parses s as an IP address, returning the result.
The string s can be in IPv4 dotted decimal ("192.0.2.1"), IPv6
("2001:db8::68"), or IPv4-mapped IPv6 ("::ffff:192.0.2.1") form.
If s is not a valid textual representation of an IP address,
ParseIP returns nil. The returned address is always 16 bytes,
IPv4 addresses are returned in IPv4-mapped IPv6 form.

Example [¶](#example-ParseIP "Go to Example")
```

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(net.ParseIP("192.0.2.1"))

```
type KeepAliveConfig struct {
	// If Enable is true, keep-alive probes are enabled.
	Enable [bool](/builtin#bool)

	// Idle is the time that the connection must be idle before
	// the first keep-alive probe is sent.

	// can go unanswered before dropping a connection.
	// If zero, a default value of 9 is used.
	Count [int](/builtin#int)
}
```

KeepAliveConfig contains TCP keep-alive options.

If the Idle, Interval, or Count fields are zero, a default value is chosen.
If a field is negative, the corresponding socket-level option will be left unchanged.

Note that prior to Windows 10 version 1709, neither setting Idle and Interval
separately nor changing Count (which is usually 10) is supported.
Therefore, it's recommended to set both Idle and Interval to non-negative values
in conjunction with a -1 for Count on those old Windows if you intend to customize
the TCP keep-alive settings.
By contrast, if only one of Idle and Interval is set to a non-negative value,
the other will be set to the system default value, and ultimately,
set both Idle and Interval to negative values if you want to leave them unchanged.

Note that Solaris and its derivatives do not support setting Interval to a non-negative value
and Count to a negative value, or vice-versa.

```
func (lc *[ListenConfig](#ListenConfig)) SetMultipathTCP(use [bool](/builtin#bool))
```

SetMultipathTCP directs the [Listen](#Listen) method to use, or not use, MPTCP,
if supported by the operating system. This method overrides the
system default and the GODEBUG=multipathtcp=... setting if any.

If MPTCP is not available on the host or not supported by the client,
the Listen method will fall back to TCP.

#### type [Listener](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/net.go;l=402) [¶](#Listener "Go to Listener")

```
type Listener interface {

It is the caller's responsibility to close ln when finished.
Closing ln does not affect f, and closing f does not affect ln.

#### func [Listen](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/dial.go;l=837) [¶](#Listen "Go to Listen")

```
func Listen(network, address [string](/builtin#string)) ([Listener](#Listener), [error](/builtin#error))
```

Listen announces on the local network address.

The network must be "tcp", "tcp4", "tcp6", "unix" or "unixpacket".

For TCP networks, if the host in the address parameter is empty or
a literal unspecified IP address, Listen listens on all available
unicast and anycast IP addresses of the local system.
To only use IPv4, use network "tcp4".
The address can use a host name, but this is not recommended,
because it will create a listener for at most one of the host's IP
addresses.
If the port in the address parameter is empty or "0", as in
"127.0.0.1:" or "[::1]:0", a port number is automatically chosen.
The [Addr](#Addr) method of [Listener](#Listener) can be used to discover the chosen
port.

See func [Dial](#Dial) for a description of the network and address
parameters.

Listen uses context.Background internally; to specify the context, use
[ListenConfig.Listen](#ListenConfig.Listen).

#### func [FilePacketConn](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/file.go;l=45) [¶](#FilePacketConn "Go to FilePacketConn")

```
func FilePacketConn(f *[os](/os).[File](/os#File)) (c [PacketConn](#PacketConn), err [error](/builtin#error))
```

FilePacketConn returns a copy of the packet network connection
corresponding to the open file f.
It is the caller's responsibility to close f when finished.
Closing c does not affect f, and closing f does not affect c.

#### func [ListenPacket](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/dial.go;l=867) [¶](#ListenPacket "Go to ListenPacket")

```
func ListenPacket(network, address [string](/builtin#string)) ([PacketConn](#PacketConn), [error](/builtin#error))
```

ListenPacket announces on the local network address.

The network must be "udp", "udp4", "udp6", "unixgram", or an IP
transport. The IP transports are "ip", "ip4", or "ip6" followed by
a colon and a literal protocol number or a protocol name, as in
"ip:1" or "ip:icmp".

For UDP and IP networks, if the host in the address parameter is
empty or a literal unspecified IP address, ListenPacket listens on
all available IP addresses of the local system except multicast IP
addresses.
To only use IPv4, use network "udp4" or "ip4:proto".
The address can use a host name, but this is not recommended,
because it will create a listener for at most one of the host's IP
addresses.
If the port in the address parameter is empty or "0", as in
"127.0.0.1:" or "[::1]:0", a port number is automatically chosen.
The LocalAddr method of [PacketConn](#PacketConn) can be used to discover the
chosen port.

See func [Dial](#Dial) for a description of the network and address
parameters.

ListenPacket uses context.Background internally; to specify the context, use
[ListenConfig.ListenPacket](#ListenConfig.ListenPacket).

LookupCNAME returns the canonical name for the given host.
Callers that do not care about the canonical name can call
[LookupHost](#LookupHost) or [LookupIP](#LookupIP) directly; both take care of resolving
the canonical name as part of the lookup.

A canonical name is the final name after following zero
or more CNAME records.
LookupCNAME does not return an error if host does not
contain DNS "CNAME" records, as long as host resolves to
address records.

The returned canonical name is validated to be a properly
formatted presentation-format domain name.

The returned records are sorted by priority and randomized
by weight within a priority.

LookupSRV constructs the DNS name to look up following [RFC 2782](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2782.html).
That is, it looks up \_service.\_proto.name. To accommodate services
publishing SRV records under non-standard names, if both service
and proto are empty strings, LookupSRV looks up name directly.

The returned service names are validated to be properly
formatted presentation-format domain names. If the response contains
invalid names, those records are filtered out and an error
will be returned alongside the remaining results, if any.

func ResolveTCPAddr(network, address [string](/builtin#string)) (*[TCPAddr](#TCPAddr), [error](/builtin#error))
```

ResolveTCPAddr returns an address of TCP end point.

The network must be a TCP network name.

If the host in the address parameter is not a literal IP address or
the port is not a literal port number, ResolveTCPAddr resolves the
address to an address of TCP end point.
Otherwise, it parses the address as a pair of literal IP address
and port number.
The address parameter can use a host name, but this is not
recommended, because it will return at most one of the host name's
IP addresses.

See func [Dial](#Dial) for a description of the network and address
parameters.

```
func (c *[TCPConn](#TCPConn)) MultipathTCP() ([bool](/builtin#bool), [error](/builtin#error))
```

MultipathTCP reports whether the ongoing connection is using MPTCP.

If Multipath TCP is not supported by the host, by the other peer or
intentionally / accidentally filtered out by a device in between, a
fallback to TCP will be done. This method does its best to check if
MPTCP is still being used or not.

On Linux, more conditions are verified on kernels >= v5.16, improving
the results.

#### func (\*TCPConn) [Read](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/net.go;l=185) [¶](#TCPConn.Read "Go to TCPConn.Read")

```
func (c *[TCPConn](#TCPConn)) SetKeepAlivePeriod(d [time](/time).[Duration](/time#Duration)) [error](/builtin#error)
```

SetKeepAlivePeriod sets the duration the connection needs to
remain idle before TCP starts sending keepalive probes.

Note that calling this method on Windows prior to Windows 10 version 1709
will reset the KeepAliveInterval to the default system value, which is normally 1 second.

#### func (\*TCPConn) [SetLinger](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/tcpsock.go;l=222) [¶](#TCPConn.SetLinger "Go to TCPConn.SetLinger")

```
func (c *[TCPConn](#TCPConn)) SetLinger(sec [int](/builtin#int)) [error](/builtin#error)
```

SetLinger sets the behavior of Close on a connection which still
has data waiting to be sent or to be acknowledged.

If sec < 0 (the default), the operating system finishes sending the
data in the background.

If sec == 0, the operating system discards any unsent or
unacknowledged data.

If sec > 0, the data is sent in the background as with sec < 0.
On some operating systems including Linux, this may cause Close to block
until all data has been sent or discarded.
On some operating systems after sec seconds have elapsed any remaining
unsent data may be discarded.

#### func (\*TCPConn) [SetNoDelay](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/%2B/go1.23.4%3Asrc/net/tcpsock.go;l=263) [¶](#TCPConn.SetNoDelay "Go to TCPConn.SetNoDelay")

```
func (c *[TCPConn](#TCPConn)) SetNoDelay(noDelay [bool](/builtin#bool)) [error](/builtin#error)
```

```

ListenTCP acts like [Listen](#Listen) for TCP networks.

The network must be a TCP network name; see func Dial for details.

If the IP field of laddr is nil or an unspecified IP address,
ListenTCP listens on all available unicast and anycast IP addresses
of the local system.
If the Port field of laddr is 0, a port number is automatically
chosen.

```
func ResolveUDPAddr(network, address [string](/builtin#string)) (*[UDPAddr](#UDPAddr), [error](/builtin#error))
```

ResolveUDPAddr returns an address of UDP end point.

The network must be a UDP network name.

If the host in the address parameter is not a literal IP address or
the port is not a literal port number, ResolveUDPAddr resolves the
address to an address of UDP end point.
Otherwise, it parses the address as a pair of literal IP address
and port number.
The address parameter can use a host name, but this is not
recommended, because it will return at most one of the host name's
IP addresses.

See func Dial for a description of the network and address
parameters.

```
func ListenMulticastUDP(network [string](/builtin#string), ifi *[Interface](#Interface), gaddr *[UDPAddr](#UDPAddr)) (*[UDPConn](#UDPConn), [error](/builtin#error))
```

ListenMulticastUDP acts like ListenPacket for UDP networks but
takes a group address on a specific network interface.

The network must be a UDP network name; see func Dial for details.

ListenMulticastUDP listens on all available IP addresses of the
local system including the group, multicast IP address.
If ifi is nil, ListenMulticastUDP uses the system-assigned
multicast interface, although this is not recommended because the
assignment depends on platforms and sometimes it might require
routing configuration.
If the Port field of gaddr is 0, a port number is automatically
chosen.

ListenMulticastUDP is just for convenience of simple, small
applications. There are golang.org/x/net/ipv4 and
golang.org/x/net/ipv6 packages for general purpose uses.

Note that ListenMulticastUDP will set the IP\_MULTICAST\_LOOP socket option
to 0 under IPPROTO\_IP, to disable loopback of multicast packets.

from the file system when the listener is closed.

The default behavior is to unlink the socket file only when package net created it.
That is, when the listener and the underlying socket file were created by a call to
Listen or ListenUnix, then by default closing the listener will remove the socket file.
but if the listener was created by a call to FileListener to use an already existing
socket file, then by default closing the listener will not remove the socket file.

### Notes [¶](#pkg-notes "Go to Notes")

### Bugs [¶](#pkg-note-BUG "Go to Bugs")

* On JS and Windows, the FileConn, FileListener and
  FilePacketConn functions are not implemented.
* On JS, methods and functions related to
  Interface are not implemented.
* On AIX, DragonFly BSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Plan 9 and
  Solaris, the MulticastAddrs method of Interface is not implemented.
* On every POSIX platform, reads from the "ip4" network
  using the ReadFrom or ReadFromIP method might not return a complete
  IPv4 packet, including its header, even if there is space
  available. This can occur even in cases where Read or ReadMsgIP
  could return a complete packet. For this reason, it is recommended
  that you do not use these methods if it is important to receive a
  full packet.

  The Go 1 compatibility guidelines make it impossible for us to
  change the behavior of these methods; use Read or ReadMsgIP
  instead.
* On JS and Plan 9, methods and functions related
  to IPConn are not implemented.
* On Windows, the File method of IPConn is not
  implemented.
* On DragonFly BSD and OpenBSD, listening on the
  "tcp" and "udp" networks does not listen for both IPv4 and IPv6
  connections. This is due to the fact that IPv4 traffic will not be
  routed to an IPv6 socket - two separate sockets are required if
  both address families are to be supported.
  See inet6(4) for details.
* On Windows, the Write method of syscall.RawConn
  does not integrate with the runtime's network poller. It cannot
  wait for the connection to become writeable, and does not respect
  deadlines. If the user-provided callback returns false, the Write
  method will fail immediately.
* On JS and Plan 9, the Control, Read and Write
  methods of syscall.RawConn are not implemented.
* On JS and Windows, the File method of TCPConn and
  TCPListener is not implemented.
* On Plan 9, the ReadMsgUDP and
  WriteMsgUDP methods of UDPConn are not implemented.
* On Windows, the File method of UDPConn is not
  implemented.
* On JS, methods and functions related to UDPConn are not
  implemented.
* On JS, WASIP1 and Plan 9, methods and functions related
  to UnixConn and UnixListener are not implemented.
* On Windows, methods and functions related to UnixConn
  and UnixListener don't work for "unixgram" and "unixpacket".

### Breaking TrustZone-M: Privilege Escalation on LPC55S69

45 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Laura Abbott Oxide Computer Company

#### Rick Altherr Oxide Computer Company

Virtual only presentation

The concept of Trusted Execution Environments has been broadly introduced to microcontrollers with ARM’s TrustZone-M. While much experience with TrustZone-A can be applied, architectural differences with ARMv8-M lead to a very different approach to configuration and transitions between secure and non-secure worlds. This talk will deep dive into how TrustZone-M works, where to look for weaknesses in implementations, and a detailed look into NXP LPC55S69’s implementation including discovering an undocumented peripheral that leads to a priviledge escalation vulnerability exploitable with TrustedFirmware-M. Finally, NXP PSIRT will be used as a case study in how \_not\_ to respond to a vulnerability report.

### The Mechanics of Compromising Low Entropy RSA Keys

20 minutes

#### Austin Allshouse Staff Research Scientist / BitSight

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Over the past decade, there have been a number of research efforts
(and DEFCON talks!) investigating the phenomenon of RSA keys on the
Internet that share prime factors with other keys. This can occur
when devices have poorly initialized sources of “randomness” when
generating keys; making it trivial to factor the RSA modulus and
recover the private key because, unlike large integer factorization,
calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two moduli can be
fast and efficient. When describing their research, past hackers and
researchers have attested that they “built a custom distributed
implementation of Batch-GCD;” which seems like one hell of a detail to
gloss over, right? This talk will detail a hacker's journey from
understanding and implementing distributed batch GCD to analyzing
findings from compromising RSA keys from network devices en masse.

### 2021 - Our Journey Back To The Future Of Windows Vulnerabilities and the 0-days we brought back with us

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Tomer Bar Director of Security Research @ SafeBreach

#### Eran Segal Security Researcher @ SafeBreach Labs

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

In 2020, security researchers reported a record number of Windows vulnerabilities. We were curious what superpowers will we get from researching this huge number of vulnerabilities? Can we leverage our findings to discover 0-days?

We decided to go back in time to 2016 to search for patterns and automatically classify all the public vulnerabilities since then. We believed that only by connecting the dots to a bigger picture, we will be able to come back 2021 with the success of achieving our goal.

We adopted a new approach, in terms of both the goal and how to get there. Until now, the main goal of patch-diff was focused on the root cause of the vulnerability and building a 1-day to exploit it Usually patch-diff was done manually on a single patch.

We reached higher for the holy grail. We understood that in order to find 0-days we needed to build an automated process that would gather all the insights from all the patches in a single, searchable db.

It worked! We discovered the root causes of multiple classes of vulnerabilities. We used these discoveries on a fully patched Windows 10 host in order to highlight opportunities for exploitation. As a consequence, we found and reported (1) 6 information disclosure vulnerabilities to Microsoft, (2) 2 post exploitation techniques allowing covert exfiltration of private user data, and (3) an additional surprise.

In this presentation, we'll describe our research process, demonstrate a live exploitation of the vulnerabilities we found, share the tools we developed, and explain how other researchers can use it to discover 0-days.

### Abusing SAST tools! When scanners do more than just scanning

45 minutes | Demo

#### Rotem Bar Head of Marketplace Integrations @ Cider Security

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

When we write code, we often run many scanners for different purposes on our code - from linters, to testing, security scanning, secret scanning, and more.

Scanning the code occurs on developers' machines and in CI/CD pipelines, which assumes the code is untrusted and unverified and based on this assumption scanners shouldn't have the ability to dynamically run code.

Our research focuses on the many static analyzers out there if this is really the case. Many of the scanners allow different ways of interaction - From requesting external resources, overriding the configuration and to remote code execution as part of the process.This talk will be technical and show examples of well-known scanning tools and how we created code that attacks them.

TLDR -

When integrating and using new tools in our CI systems and especially when running on unverified code, Which tools can we trust and how can we scan safe untrusted code in a secure way?

### The Unbelievable Insecurity of the Big Data Stack: An Offensive Approach to Analyzing Huge and Complex Big Data Infrastructures

45 minutes | Demo

#### Sheila A. Berta Head of Research at Dreamlab Technologies

Virtual only presentation

Honoring the term, the variety of technologies in the Big Data stack is hugely BIG. Many complex components in charge of transport, storing, and processing millions of records make up Big Data infrastructures. The speed at which data needs to be processed and how quickly the implemented technologies need to communicate with each other make security lag behind. Once again, complexity is the worst enemy of security.

Today, when conducting a security assessment on Big Data infrastructures, there is currently no methodology for it and there are hardly any technical resources to analyze the attack vectors. On top of that, many things that are considered vulnerabilities in conventional infrastructures, or even in the Cloud, are not vulnerabilities in this stack. What is a security problem and what is not a security problem in Big Data infrastructures? That is one of the many questions that this research answers. Security professionals need to count on a methodology and acquire the necessary skills to competently analyze the security of such infrastructures.

This talk presents a methodology, and new and impactful attack vectors in the four layers of the Big Data stack: Data Ingestion, Data Storage, Data Processing and Data Access. Some of the techniques that will be exposed are the remote attack of the centralized cluster configuration managed by ZooKeeper; packet crafting for remote communication with the Hadoop RPC/IPC to compromise the HDFS; development of a malicious YARN application to achieve RCE; interfering data ingestion channels as well as abusing the drivers of HDFS-based storage technologies like Hive/HBase, and platforms to query multiple data lakes as Presto. In addition, security recommendations will be provided to prevent the attacks explained.

REFERENCES:

I plan to release a white paper at the conference, in the white paper there will be all the references. Anyway, as the attacks are novel, the references are related to infrastructure stuff mostly, not so much about security.

### Hacking G Suite: The Power of Dark Apps Script Magic

45 minutes | Tool

#### Matthew Bryant Red Team @ Snapchat

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

You’ve seen plenty of talks on exploiting, escalating, and exfiltrating the magical world of Google Cloud (GCP), but what about its buttoned-down sibling? This talk delves into the dark art of utilizing Apps Script to exploit G Suite (AKA Google Workspace).

As a studious sorcerer, you’ll discover how to pierce even the most fortified G Suite enterprises. You’ll learn to conjure Apps Script payloads to bypass powerful protective enchantments such as U2F, OAuth app allowlisting, and locked-down enterprise Chromebooks.

Our incantations don’t stop at the perimeter, we will also discover novel spells to escalate our internal privileges and bring more G Suite accounts under our control. Once we’ve obtained the access we seek, we’ll learn various curses to persist ourselves whilst keeping a low profile so as to not risk an unwelcome exorcism.

You don’t need divination to see that this knowledge just might rival alchemy in value.

### PunkSPIDER and IOStation: Making a Mess All Over the Internet

45 minutes | Demo,Tool

#### \_hyp3ri0n aka Alejandro Caceres Director of Computer Network Exploitation at QOMPLX, former owner of Hyperion Gray

#### Jason Hopper Hacker

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

We've been getting asked a lot for "that tool that was like Shodan but for web app vulns.” In particular WTF happened to it? Punkspider (formerly known as PunkSPIDER but renamed because none of us could remember where tf the
capital letters go) was taken down a couple of years ago due to multiple ToS issues and threats. It was originally funded by DARPA. We weren’t sure in which direction to keep expanding, and it ended up being a nightmare to
sustain. We got banned more than a 15 year old with a fake ID trying to get into a bar. It became a pain and hardly sustainable without a lot of investment in time and money. Each time we got banned it meant thousands of dollars
and countless hours moving sh\*\* around.

Now we’ve solved our problems and completely re-engineered/expanded the system. It is not only far more efficient with real-time distributed computing and checks for way more vulns, we had to take some creative ways through the
woods – this presentation covers both the tool itself and the story of the path we had to take to get where it is, spoiler alert: it involves creating our own ISP and data center in Canada and integrating freely available data
that anyone can get but most don’t know is available. Come play with us and see what the wild west of the web looks like and listen to our story, it’s fun and full of angry web developers. We’ll also be releasing at least 10s
of thousands of vulnerabilities and will be taking suggestions from the audience on what to search. Fun vulns found get a t-shirt, super fun ones get a hoodie thrown at them.

### Hack the hackers: Leaking data over SSL/TLS

20 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Ionut Cernica PHD Student @Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science, University Politehnica of Bucharest

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Have you considered that in certain situations the way hackers exploit vulnerabilities over the network can be predictable? Anyone with access to encrypted traffic can reverse the logic behind the exploit and thus obtain the same data as the exploit.

Various automated tools have been analyzed and it has been found that these tools operate in an unsafe way. Various exploit databases were analyzed and we learned that some of these are written in an insecure (predictable) way.

This presentation will showcase the results of the research, including examples of exploits that once executed can be harmful. The data we obtain after exploitation can be accessible to other entities without the need of decrypting the traffic. The SSL/TLS specs will not change. There is a clear reason for that and in this presentation I will argue this, but what will change for sure is the way hackers will write some of the exploits.

**Ionut Cernica**
 Ionut Cernica started his security career with the bug bounty program from Facebook. His passion for security led him to get involved in dozens of such programs and he found problems in very large companies such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, AT&T, eBay, VMware.

### Taking Apart and Taking Over ICS & SCADA Ecosystems: A Case Study of Mitsubishi Electric

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Mars Cheng Threat researcher for TXOne Networks

#### Selmon Yang Staff Engineer at TXOne Networks

Virtual only presentation

Diversified Industrial Control System (ICS) providers create a variety of ecosystems, which have come to operate silently in the background of our lives. Among these organizations, Mitsubishi Electric ranks among the most prolific. Because the operation of this ecosystem is so widely used in key manufacturing, natural gas supply, oil, water, aviation, railways, chemicals, food and beverages, and construction, it is closely-related to people's lives. For this reason, the security of this ecosystem is extraordinarily important.

This research will enter the Mitsubishi ecosystem’s communication protocol, using it as a lens with which to deeply explore the differences between itself and other ecosystems. We will show how we successfully uncovered flaws in its identity authentication function, including how to take it over and show that such an attack can cause physical damage in different critical sectors. We’ll explain how we accomplished this by applying reverse engineering and communication analysis. This flaw allows attackers to take over any asset within the entire series of Mitsubishi PLCs, allowing command of the ecosystem and full control of the relevant sensors. A further complication is that making a fix to the various communication protocols in the ICS/SCADA is extremely difficult. We will also share the various problems we encountered while researching these findings and provide the most workable detection and mitigation strategies for those protocols.

### Crossover Episode: The Real-Life Story of the First Mainframe Container Breakout

45 minutes | Demo

#### Ian Coldwater Hacker

#### Chad Rikansrud (Bigendian Smalls) Hacker

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

You've seen talks about container hacking. You've seen talks about mainframe hacking. But how often do you see them together? IBM decided to put containers on a mainframe, so a container hacker and a mainframe hacker decided to join forces and hack it. We became the first people on the planet to escape a container on a mainframe, and we’re going to show you how.

Containers on a mainframe? For real. IBM zCX is a Docker environment running on a custom Linux hypervisor built atop z/OS - IBM’s mainframe operating system. Building this platform introduces mainframe environments to a new generation of cloud-native developers-and introduces new attack surfaces that weren’t there before.

In this crossover episode, we’re going to talk about how two people with two very particular sets of skills went about breaking zCX in both directions, escaping containers into the mainframe host and spilling the secrets of the container implementation from the mainframe side.

When two very different technologies get combined for the first time, the result is new shells nobody’s ever popped before.

Mired in the hell of a global pandemic, hospital capacity stressed to its limit, doctors and nurses overworked and exhausted... surely the baddies would cut us a little slack and leave little 'ol healthcare alone for a bit, right? Well, raise your hand if you saw this one coming. Another year of rampaging ransomware, of pwned patient care- only this time backdropped by the raging dumpster fire that is COVID. Can we once and for all dispel with the Pollyannas telling us that nobody would knowingly seek to harm patients? And if we can't convince the powers that be- whether in the hospital C-suite or in DC- that we need to take this $%& seriously now, then what hope do we have for pushing patient safety to the forefront when things return to some semblance of normal? With a heavily curated panel including policy badasses, elite hackers, and seasoned clinicians - D0 N0 H4RM remains the preeminent forum where insight from experts collide with the ingenuity and imagination of the DEF CON grassroots to inspire activism and collaboration stretching far beyond closing ceremonies.

Moderated by physician hackers quaddi and r3plicant, this perennially packed event always fills up fast - so make sure you join us. As always- the most important voice is yours.

### No Key? No PIN? No Combo? No Problem! P0wning ATMs For Fun and Profit

45 minutes | Demo

#### Roy Davis Senior Security Engineer, Zoom Video Communications

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Since the late great Barnaby Jack gave us “Jack Potting” in the late 2000s, there have been several talks on ATM network attacks, USB port attacks, and digital locks attacks which apply to several brands of ATM safes. In this session, I’ll discuss and demonstrate how most of these known attack vectors have been remediated, while several fairly simple attacks against the machine and the safe still remain. We’ll dive into how ATMs work, the steps I went through to become a “licenced ATM operator” which enabled my research, and how I identified the vulnerabilities. I’ll show how, with very little technical expertise and 20 minutes, these attacks lead directly past “secure” and allow attackers to collect a lot more than $200.

### Unlocking KeeLoq – A Reverse Engineering Story

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Rogan Dawes Researcher, Orange Cyberdefense’s SensePost Team

Virtual only presentation

KeeLoq Remote Keyless Entry systems make use of radio frequency transmissions to operate and have many known weaknesses. A 64-bit manufacturer key is used in transmissions to encrypt an incrementing transmission sequence number in order to provide replay protection. This presentation is a journey into bringing existing research together to make personal Keeloq projects practical, ultimately repurposing a commercial receiver as part of a home automation system integration project.

I will demonstrate how I recovered the manufacturer key by extracting and reverse engineering the receiver’s firmware using a JTAG adapter and Ghidra. Next, I will cover decoding and decrypting the KeeLoq transmissions (verified using a logic analyzer), cloning the captured serial and sequence numbers to a new transmitter, and finally, how to export the received transmissions to a home automation system via an add-on WiFi-capable microcontroller.

### Instrument and Find Out: Writing Parasitic Tracers for High(-Level) Languages

20 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Jeff Dileo Technical Director, NCC Group

Virtual only presentation

Modern programming languages are, more and more, being designed not just around performance, ease-of-use, and (sometimes) security, but also performance monitoring and introspectability. But what about the languages that never adopted such concepts from their peers? Or worse, what about the languages that tacked on half-hearted implementations as an afterthought? The answer is simple, you write your own and instrument them into the language dynamically.

In this talk, we will discuss the process for developing generalized parasitic tracers targeting specific programming languages and runtimes using Ruby as our case study. We will show how feasible it is to write external tracers targeting a language and its runtime, and discuss best practices for supporting different versions over time.

### Vulnerability Exchange: One Domain Account For More Than Exchange Server RCE

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Tianze Ding Senior security researcher, Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab

Virtual only presentation

Microsoft Exchange Server is one of the most famous mail servers in the world. It not only stores a large amount of sensitive corporate information, but also plays an important role in Microsoft Active Directory, so it has become a high-value target for both APT groups and red teams.

In the past few months, some high-risk vulnerabilities in Exchange Server have been exposed, which mainly target vulnerable ASP.NET code. But the architecture of Exchange Server is complicated, and its attack surface is not limited to ASP.NET, this talk will analyze and attack Exchange Server from a different perspective.

I will share the following two new vulnerabilities I found, as well as the new attack surfaces and how I chained several techniques to successfully exploit them in detail.

1. One of them can result in arbitrary mailbox takeover, attackers can read emails, download attachments, send emails, etc. as any Exchange user.

2. The other can lead to remote code execution on Exchange Server, attackers can gain local administrator privileges and execute arbitrary commands. Furthermore, there is an interesting point, even if you have applied the latest Exchange Server patches, your Exchange Server may still be compromised by this type of attack.

For red teams, Exchange Server RCE is only the beginning. Usually, there are some high-privileged domain users and groups on Exchange Server, I will also introduce a new method in depth to help you perform lateral movement and even privilege escalation to Domain Admin after achieving Exchange Server RCE.

These vulnerabilities have been reported to MSRC and the exploit tools will be released after the talk.

### Response Smuggling: Pwning HTTP/1.1 Connections

45 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Martin Doyhenard Security Researcher at Onapsis

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Over the past few years, we have seen some novel presentations re-introducing the concept of HTTP request smuggling, to reliably exploit complex landscapes and systems. With advanced techniques, researchers were able to bypass restrictions and breach the security of critical web applications.

This presentation will take a new approach, focusing on the response pipeline desynchronization, a rather unexplored attack vector in HTTP Smuggling.

First, I will introduce a Desync variant, using connection-tokens to hide arbitrary headers from the backend. This technique does not abuse discrepancy between HTTP parsers, but instead relies on a vulnerability in the protocol itself!

The issue was found and reported under Google’s Vulnerability Reward Program for a nice bounty!

Next, I will show how it is possible to inject multiple messages at the backend server, mixing the pipeline’s connection order, and hijack users sessions from login requests.

Finally, using a novel technique known as Response Scripting, I will demonstrate how to create malicious outbound messages using static responses as the building blocks. This will be leveraged to write custom responses and take control of one of the most popular protocols in history!

### Worming through IDEs

20 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### David Dworken Security Engineer, Google

Virtual only presentation

You might think that as long as you never hit run, opening up that interesting new POC in your IDE and checking out the code is safe. But it isn't. IDEs and developer tools are complex pieces of software that have vulnerabilities, just like everything else.

We'll start by discussing what a reasonable threat model is for IDEs. How do companies threat model their IDEs? What do users expect of their IDEs? Is viewing a file equivalent to executing it?

Then we'll dive into the reality of it. Nearly every IDE examined was trivially vulnerable. But there were also a variety of subtle bugs lying underneath. We'll look at bugs in both local IDEs (like VSCode and IntelliJ) and cloud-based IDEs (like AWS Cloud9 and Github Codespaces).

Finally, we'll show how an attacker could make a worm that would spread through attacking IDEs. View a malicious project? Let's automatically backdoor every project on a computer and keep spreading.

### eBPF, I thought we were friends !

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Guillaume Fournier Security Engineer at Datadog

#### Sylvain Afchain Staff Engineer at Datadog

#### Sylvain Baubeau Staff Engineer at Datadog

Virtual only presentation

Since its first appearance in Kernel 3.18, eBPF (Extended Berkley Packet Filter) has progressively become a key technology for observability in the Linux kernel. Initially dedicated to network monitoring, eBPF can now be used to monitor and trace any kind of kernel space activity.

Over the past few years, many vendors have started using eBPF to speed up their services or introduce innovative features. Cilium, Calico, Cloudflare, Netflix and Facebook are leading the charge, showing off new complex networking use cases on a monthly basis. On the security side of things, Google recently contributed the Kernel Runtime Security Instrumentation which opens the door to writing Linux Security Modules with eBPF.

In other words, eBPF is the new kid in town and a growing number of companies are running services with eBPF access in production. This leads us to a simple question: how bad can things get if one of those services were to be compromised ? This talk will cover how we leveraged eBPF to implement a full blown rootkit with all the features you would expect: various obfuscation techniques, command and control with remote and persistent access, data theft and exfiltration techniques, Runtime Application Self-Protection evasion techniques, and finally two original container breakout techniques.

Simply put, our goal is to demonstrate that rogue kernel modules might have finally found a worthy opponent. We will also detail how to detect such attacks and protect your infrastructure from them, while safely enjoying the exciting capabilities that eBPF has to offer.

### DoS: Denial of Shopping – Analyzing and Exploiting (Physical) Shopping Cart Immobilization Systems

20 minutes

#### Joseph Gabay Hacker

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Many supermarkets and shopping centers have implemented devices that “lock” their shopping carts if they’re taken outside of an approved boundary (e.g, a parking lot). This talk examines some of the technology that’s used to do this, as well as ways to capture and spoof the control signals to defeat these devices.

We will go over the anatomy of remotely lockable shopping cart wheels, their basic theory, and get into how they’re controlled. We’ll deconstruct some samples of the lock and unlock signals captured using a homemade antenna and a HackRF, and briefly discuss methods of rebroadcasting them – as well as the challenges inherent to this process.

### Robots with lasers and cameras (but no security): Liberating your vacuum from the cloud

45 minutes | Tool, Exploit

#### Dennis Giese Hacker

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Vacuum robots are becoming increasingly popular and affordable as their technology grows ever more advanced, including sensors like lasers and cameras. It is easy to imagine interesting new projects to exploit these capabilities. However, all of them rely on sending data to the cloud. Do you trust the companies promise that no video streams are uploaded to the cloud and that your personal data is safe? Why not collect the dust with open-source software?

I previously showed ways to root robots such as Roborock and Xiaomi, which enabled owners to use their devices safely with open-source home automation. In response, vendors began locking down their devices with technologies like Secure Boot, SELinux, LUKS encrypted partitions and custom crypto that prevents gaining control over our own devices. This talk will update my newest methods for rooting these devices.

The market of vacuum robots expanded in the past 2 years. In particular, the Dreame company has recently released many models with interesting hardware, like ToF cameras and line lasers. This can be a nice alternative for rooting. I will show easy ways to get root access on these devices and bypass all security. I will also discuss backdoors and security issues I discovered from analysis. You will be surprised what the developers left in the firmware.

### Defeating Physical Intrusion Detection Alarm Wires

45 minutes | Tool

#### Bill Graydon Principal, Research, GGR Security

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Alarm systems are ubiquitous - no longer the realm of banks and vaults only, many people now have them in their homes or workplaces. But how do they work? And the logical follow-up question - how can they be hacked?

This talk focuses on the communication lines in physical intrusion detection systems: how they are secured, and what vulnerabilities exist. We’ll discuss the logic implemented in the controllers and protections on the communication lines including end of line resistors - and all the ways that this aspect of the system can be exploited.

In particular, we’ll release schematics for a tool we’ve developed that will enable measuring end-of-line resistor systems covertly, determining the necessary re-wiring to defeat the sensors, and deploy it without setting off the alarm.

After the talk, you can head over to the Lock Bypass Village to try these techniques out for yourself!

### Phantom Attack: Evading System Call Monitoring

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Rex Guo Head of Research, Confluera

#### Junyuan Zeng Senior Software Engineer, Linkedin

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Phantom attack is a collection of attacks that evade Linux system call monitoring. A user mode program does not need any special privileges or capabilities to reliably evade system call monitoring using Phantom attack by exploiting insecure tracing implementations.

After adversaries gain an initial foothold on a Linux system, they typically perform post-exploitation activities such as reconnaissance, execution, privilege escalation, persistence, etc. It is extremely difficult if not impossible to perform any non-trivial adversarial activities without using Linux system calls.

Security monitoring solutions on Linux endpoints typically offer system call monitoring to effectively detect attacks. Modern solutions often use either ebpf-based programs or kernel modules to monitor system calls through tracepoint and/or kprobe. Any adversary operations including abnormal and/or suspicious system calls reveal additional information to the defenders and can trigger detection alerts.

We will explain the generic nature of the vulnerabilities exploited by Phantom attack. We will demonstrate Phantom attack on two popular open source Linux system call monitoring solutions Falco (Sysdig) and Tracee (Aquasecurity). We will also explain the differences between Phantom v1 and v2 attacks. Finally, we will discuss mitigations for Phantom attack and secure tracing in the broader context beyond system call tracing.

### TEMPEST radio station

45 minutes | Tool

#### Paz Hameiri Hacker

Virtual only presentation

TEMPEST is a cyber security term that refers to the use of electromagnetic energy emissions generated by electronic devices to leak data out of a target device.
The attacks may be passive (where the attacker receives the emissions and recovers the data) or active (where the attacker uses dedicated malware to target and emit specific data).

In this talk I present a new side channel attack that uses GPU memory transfers to emit electromagnetic waves which are then received and processed by the attacker.
Software developed for this work encodes audio on one computer and transmits it to the reception equipment positioned fifty feet away.
The signals are received and processed and the audio is decoded and played. The maximum bit rate achieved was 33kbit/s and more than 99% of the packets were received.

Frequency selection not only enables maximization of signal quality over distance, but also enables the attacker to receive signals from a specific computer when several computers in the area are active. The software developed demonstrates audio packets transfers, but other types of digital data may be transmitted using the same technique.

### Old MacDonald Had a Barcode, E-I-E-I CAR

45 minutes | Demo

#### Richard Henderson

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

For decades, the EICAR test string has been used by antivirus and security vendors to safely test their detection engines without having to use live virulent samples which could cause harm. What would happen if you took that string, encoded it into a machine readable format like a QR code and started scanning various devices with the QR code? This talk shows how there are a lot of systems out there that aren't expecting an input string like EICAR and how many of them just collapse when shown the code. We will also discuss the types of systems you can target and how you may be able to extend this to more than a nuisance attack.

### Sleight of ARM: Demystifying Intel Houdini

45 minutes | Demo

#### Brian Hong Security Consultant, NCC Group

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

In the recent years, we have seen some of the major players in the industry switch from x86-based processors to ARM processors. However, you might be surprised to know that Intel has long supported ARM to x86 transition with their binary translator, Houdini, which runs ARM binaries on x86.

In this talk, we will discuss Intel's proprietary Houdini translator, which is primarily used by Android on x86 platforms, such as higher-end Chromebooks and desktop Android emulators. We will start with a high-level discussion of how Houdini works and is loaded into processes. We will then dive into the low-level internals of the Houdini engine and memory model, including several security weaknesses it introduces into processes using it. Lastly, we will discuss methods to escape the Houdini environment, execute arbitrary ARM and x86, and write Houdini-targeted malware that bypasses existing platform analysis.

### Caught you - reveal and exploit IPC logic bugs inside Apple

45 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Zhipeng Huo Senior Researcher, Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab

#### Yuebin Sun Senior Researcher, Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab

#### Chuanda Ding Senior Researcher, Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab

Virtual only presentation

Apple's iOS, macOS and other OS have existed for a long time. There are numerous interesting logic bugs hidden for many years.
We demonstrated the world's first public 0day exploit running natively on Apple M1 on a MacBook Air (M1, 2020). Without any modification, we exploited an iPhone 12 Pro with the same bug.

In this talk, we will show you the advantage and beauty of the IPC logic bugs, how we rule all Apple platforms, Intel and Apple Silicon alike, even with all the latest hardware mitigations enabled, without changing one line of code.
We would talk about the security features introduced by Apple M1, like Pointer Authentication Code (PAC), System Integrity, and Data Protection. How did they make exploiting much harder to provide better security and protect user's privacy.
We will talk about different IPC mechanisms like Mach Message, XPC, and NSXPC. They are widely used on Apple platforms which could be abused to break the well designed security boundaries.

We will walk you through some incredibly fun logic bugs we have discovered, share the stories behind them and methods of finding them, and also talk about how to exploit these logic bugs to achieve privilege escalation.

### New Phishing Attacks Exploiting OAuth Authentication Flows

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Jenko Hwong Netskope Threat Research team

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

OAuth 2.0 device authorization gives users on limited-input devices like TVs an easier way to authenticate against and authorize a cloud website/app by entering a code on a computer/phone. This authentication and authorization flow leads to new phishing attacks that:

- do not need server infrastructure--the login page is served by the authorization provider using their domain and cert

- do not require a client application--application identities can be reused/spoofed

- do not require user consent of application permissions

Since the phish attacks hijack oauth session tokens, MFA will be ineffective as the attacker does not need to reauthenticate. The ability to defend against these attacks is hindered by limited info and functionality to detect, mitigate, and prevent session token compromise.

I'll demonstrate these new phishing attacks, access to sensitive user data, and lateral movement.

Defensive measures against these phishing attacks will be discussed, specifically the challenges in detection, mitigation, and prevention, and the overall lack of support for managing temporary credentials.

Open-source tools have been developed and will be used to demonstrate how users can:

- self-phish their organizations using these techniques

- audit security settings that help prevent/mitigate the attacks

### Wibbly Wobbly, Timey Wimey – What's Really Inside Apple's U1 Chip

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

Virtual only presentation

Apple introduced an Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip in the iPhone 11. Its cryptographically secured spatial measurement capabilities are accessible via the Nearby Interaction framework since iOS 14. As of now, it only supports interaction with other Apple devices including the latest Apple Watch and HomePod mini. These are the first steps to support UWB in a larger ecosystem, as measuring precise distance and direction can be an enabler for various future applications. The automotive industry already announced UWB support for mobile car keys on the iPhone.

But what’s really inside Apple’s U1 chip, internally called Rose? In this talk, we will travel through time, space, firmware and kernel components—and fight daemons to modify firmware interaction from user space. This will not only cover one or two, but three firmwares that process or forward each Rose time measurement: The Rose Digital Signal Processor (DSP), Rose Application Processor (AP), and the Always-On Processor (AOP).

### Rotten code, aging standards, & pwning IPv4 parsing across nearly every mainstream programming language

45 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Kelly Kaoudis

#### Sick Codes Hacker

Virtual only presentation

Openness to responsibly disclosed external vulnerability research is crucial for modern software maintainers and security teams. Changes in upstream dependency code may have pulled the safety rug out from underneath widely trusted core libraries, leaving millions of services vulnerable to unsophisticated attacks. The impact of even a single reasonably well-distributed supply-chain security vulnerability will be felt by engineering teams across many applications, companies, and industries.

We'd like to discuss an IP address parsing vulnerability first discovered in private-ip, a small and infrequently maintained yet critically important NodeJS package for determining if an IP address should be considered part of a private range or not. We'll talk about not only the implications of this CVE but taking the main idea and applying it across multiple programming languages in uniquely disturbing ways.

Sometimes, the effects of code rot are even more far-reaching than we could possibly expect, and if you pull on a thread, it just keeps going. Sometimes, you get lucky when you know exactly what you're looking for. Sometimes, it's hard to convince other technically-minded folks that a seemingly trivial implementation flaw is dangerous in capable hands.

This talk is beginner as well as advanced-friendly; we'll show you the basics a hacker or a programmer needs to know about IP address parsing and how to tell your octal from your decimal along the way.

### HTTP/2: The Sequel is Always Worse

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### James Kettle Director of Research, PortSwigger Web Security

Virtual only presentation

HTTP/2 is easily mistaken for a transport-layer protocol that can be swapped in with zero security implications for the website behind it. Two years ago, I presented HTTP Desync Attacks and kicked off a wave of request smuggling, but HTTP/2 escaped serious analysis. In this presentation, I'll take you beyond the frontiers of existing HTTP/2 research, to unearth horrifying implementation flaws and subtle RFC oversights.

I'll show you how these flaws enable HTTP/2-exclusive desync attacks, with case studies targeting high-profile websites powered by servers ranging from Amazon's Application Load Balancer to WAFs, CDNs, and bespoke stacks by big tech. I'll demonstrate critical impact by hijacking thick clients, poisoning caches, and stealing plaintext passwords to net multiple max-bounties.

After that, I'll unveil novel techniques and tooling to crack open a widespread but overlooked request smuggling variant affecting both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 that is typically mistaken for a false positive.

Finally, I'll drop multiple exploit-primitives that resurrect a largely-forgotten class of vulnerability, and use HTTP/2 to expose fresh application-layer attack surface.

I'll leave you with an open-source scanner, a custom, open-source HTTP/2 stack, and free interactive labs so you can hone your new skills on live systems.

### Over-the-air remote code execution on the DEF CON 27 badge via Near Field Magnetic Inductance or World’s first NFMI exploitation, sorta or OTARCEDC27NFMIOMGWTFBBQ

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Seth Kintigh Hardware Security Engineer, Dell

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

The DEF CON 27 badge employed an obscure form of wireless communication: Near Field Magnetic Inductance (NFMI). The badges were part of a contest and while poking through the firmware for hints I noticed a buffer overflow flaw. All it required to exploit it was an oversized packet… via a chip with no datasheet and no documentation on the proprietary protocol. Thus started a 2 year odyssey.

I used Software Defined Radio tools to study the signal’s modulations. I built a receiver in GNURadio and Python to convert signals into symbols, symbols obfuscated by a pattern that I had to deduce while only controlling a fraction of the bytes. Data was encoded in those symbols using proprietary convolution for even bits and Trellis Code Modulation for odd bits. I then reversed their bizarre CRC and wrote tools to craft and send packets. Using those tools I chained bugs in 2 chips and remotely crashed the badge. However, limitations in the NFMI protocol made more sophisticated attacks impossible.

But after a year and a half invested, I was not about to give up. I soldered leads to middle layer traces, extracted and reverse engineered the NFMI firmware, fixed their protocol, and patched a badge FW to patch the NFMI FW. At long last I achieved what may be the world’s first, over-the-air, remote code exploit via NFMI.

#### Bill "Woody" Woodcock Chair of the Foundation Council, Quad9, Packet Clearing House

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

As if 2020 and 2021 were not bad enough, the Covid-19 pandemic seemed to have been accompanied by a new rash of bad cyber- attacks on major platforms like Solarwinds and Microsoft, infrastructures worldwide subverted in ransomware campaigns, and even the very organizations researching and fighting the pandemic have been hit.

Meanwhile, the hard work of cyber diplomacy continues, with talks on war and peace in the United Nations reaching a new stage as two working groups presented their final report and a third one is in the process of being born. Mostly the topics are on establishing norms on cyber behavior, rules of the road of what states can do in cyberspace.  But where are the hackers in all this? The Internet is famously not run by intergovernmental organizations, so the companies, civil society groups and others should somehow be involved – and one of the UN processes did in fact make a small step in that direction. But the staid ways of pin-striped cyber are hard to change. What is the best way for the community to engage?

### Fuzzing Linux with Xen

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Tamas K Lengyel Senior Security Researcher, Intel

Virtual only presentation

Last year we've successfully upstreamed a new feature to Xen that allows high-speed fuzzing of virtual machines (VMs) using VM-forking. Recently through collaboration with the Xen community external monitoring of VMs via Intel(r) Processor Trace has also been upstreamed. Combined with the native Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) capability Xen now provides a unique platform for fuzzing and binary analysis.

To illustrate the power of the platform we'll present the details of a real-world fuzzing operation that targeted Linux kernel-modules from an attack-vector that has previously been hard to reach: memory exposed to devices via Direct Memory Access (DMA) for fast I/O. If the input the kernel reads from DMA-exposed memory is malformed or malicious - what could happen?

So far we discovered: 9 NULL-pointer dereferences; 3 array index out-of-bound accesses; 2 infinite-loops in IRQ context and 2 instances of tricking the kernel into accessing user-memory but thinking it is kernel memory. The bugs have been in Linux for many years and were found in kernel modules used by millions of devices. All bugs are now fixed upstream.

This talk will walk you through how the bugs were found: what process we went through to identify the right code-locations; how we analyzed the kernel source and how we analyzed the runtime of the kernel with Xen to pinpoint the input points that read from DMA. The talk will explain the steps required to attach a debugger through the hypervisor to collect kernel crash logs and how to perform triaging of bugs via VM-fork execution-replay, a novel technique akin to time-travel debugging. Finally, we'll close with the release of a new open-source tool to perform full-VM taint analysis using Xen and Intel(r) Processor Trace.

### Hacking Humans with AI as a Service

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Eugene Lim Cybersecurity Specialist, Government Technology Agency of Singapore

#### Glenice Tan Cybersecurity Specialist, Government Technology Agency of Singapore

#### Tan Kee Hock Cybersecurity Specialist, Government Technology Agency of Singapore

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

As the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) products such as OpenAI's GPT-3 API places advanced synthetic media generation capabilities in the hands of a global audience at a fraction of the cost, what does the future hold for AI-assisted social engineering attacks? In our talk, we will present the nuts and bolts of an AIaaS phishing pipeline that was successfully deployed in multiple authorized phishing campaigns. Using both paid and free services, we emulated the techniques that even low-skilled, limited resource actors could adopt to execute effective AI-assisted phishing campaigns at scale. By repurposing easily-accessible personality analysis AIaaS products, we generated persuasive phishing emails that were automatically personalized based on a target's public social media information and created by state-of-the-art natural language generators. We will also discuss how an AI-assisted phishing workflow would impact traditional social engineering teams and operations. Finally, we look at how AIaaS suppliers can mitigate the misuse of their products.

### Do you like to read? I know how to take over your Kindle with an e-book

20 minutes

#### Slava Makkaveev Security Researcher, Check Point

Virtual only presentation

Since 2007, Amazon has sold tens of millions of Kindles, which is impressive. But this also means that tens of millions of people can be hacked through a software bug in those same Kindles. Their devices can be turned into bots, their private local networks can be compromised, and perhaps even information in their billing accounts can be stolen.

The easiest way to remotely reach a user's Kindle is through an e-book. A malicious book can be published and made available for free access in any virtual library, including the Kindle Store, or sent directly to the end-user device via Amazon services.
While you might not be happy with the writing in a particular book, nobody expects to download one that is malicious. No such scenarios have been publicized. Antiviruses do not have signatures for e-books.
But... we succeeded in making a malicious book for you. If you open this book on a Kindle device, it causes a hidden piece of code to be executed with root rights. From this moment on, you lost your e-reader, account and more.

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

According to a former senior White House official, 2020 was the year that ransomware went from being a nuisance to a full-scale national security threat and a “scourge”. After an awkward adolescence spent shaking down individual users for a couple hundred dollars and a big debut in 2017 with WannaCry and NotPetya , ransomware really hit the big time in 2020. Ransom payments may have topped $400 million plus that year. But those sums are nothing compared to the damage that ransomware campaigns can cause, especially when they hit critical infrastructure like Colonial Pipeline. And even months after Colonial Pipeline, ransomware continues to regularly subvert and cripple enterprises in the US and Europe. Are we not learning the right lessons on defense? Or is it not just an infosec problem, but also an international security issue, with cybercrime being actively wielded – yet again – as a political weapon?

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

It's a tale as old as time: a graduating senior needs two more courses to graduate, but the lectures happen to be scheduled at the same time and the school's new high-tech wireless attendance tracking system makes it impossible to attend both courses... in theory. By reverse-engineering the attendance devices and emulating them using a hidden Arduino, the system can be tricked into giving attendance credit for both courses without being physically present. It's a real-life "time turner," allowing him to be in two places at once.

In 1998 the US government issued the first major policy document on Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP). Since then, CIP has become one of the most fundamental tasks for governments everywhere, and has given birth to a plethora of institutions and processes seeking to manage what is called a “Public Private Partnership” between government, industry, and civil society. But despite all the efforts put into information exchanges, incident management, but also supply chain protection and even national industrial policies, cyber-attacks have not decreased, both in the United States and elsewhere. What else needs to be done? What lessons learned are there from international experiences? And how can the community help best?

### Gone Apple Pickin': Red Teaming macOS Environments in 2021

45 minutes | Demo

#### Cedric Owens Offensive Security Engineer

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Though the vast majority of US companies are enterprise Windows shops, there is a growing percentage of companies that are shifting away from this model. Most of these types of companies tend to be based in the SF Bay Area and are often tech companies. This talk will provide a glimpse into what common attack paths in these environments look like in the absence of typical enterprise Active Directory implementations. Examples include techniques for targeting macOS endpoints, cloud and IdaaS, CI/CD pipeline, and other fun approaches. I will begin by discussing common tech stacks and macOS deployments and then move into macOS initial access (including the Gatekeeper bypass I found) and post exploitation options in these modern tech environments as well as detection opportunities.

**Cedric Owens**
 Cedric is currently an offensive security engineer who came from a blue team background. His passion revolves around red teams and blue teams working closely together to improve each other's tradecraft.

### Warping Reality - creating and countering the next generation of Linux rootkits using eBPF

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### PatH Security Researcher

Virtual only presentation

With complete access to a system, Linux kernel rootkits are perfectly placed to hide malicious access and activity. However, running code in the kernel comes with the massive risk that any change to a kernel version or configuration can mean the difference between running successfully and crashing the entire system. This talk will cover how to use extended Berkley Packet Filters (eBPF) to create kernel rootkits that are safe, stable, stealthy, and portable.

eBPF is one of the newest additions to the Linux kernel, designed to easily load safe, constrained, and portable programs into the kernel to observe and make decisions about network traffic, syscalls, and more. But that’s not it’s only use: by creating eBPF programs that target specific processes we can warp reality, presenting a version of a file to one program and a different version to another, all without altering the real file on disk. This enables techniques such as presenting a backdoor user to ssh while hiding from sysadmins, or smuggling data inside connections from legitimate programs. This talk will also cover how to use these same techniques in malware analysis to fool anti-sanbox checks.

These ideas and more are explored in this talk alongside practical methods to detect and prevent this next generation of Linux rootkits.

### Hi! I'm DOMAIN\Steve, please let me access VLAN2

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Justin Perdok Security Specialist, Orange Cyberdefense Netherlands

Virtual only presentation

By responding to probing requests made by Palo Alto and SonicWALL firewalls, it's possible to apply security policies to arbitrary IPs on the network, allowing access to segmented resources.

Segmentation using firewalls is a critical security component for an organization. To scale, many firewall vendors have features that make rule implementation simpler, such as basing effective access on a user identity or workstation posture. Security products that probe client computers often have their credentials abused by either cracking a password hash, or by relaying an authentication attempt elsewhere. Prior work by Esteban Rodriguez and by Xavier Mertens cover this. In this talk I will show a new practical attack on identity-based firewalls to coerce them into applying chosen security policies to arbitrary IPs on a network by spoofing logged in users instead of cracking passwords.

Logged on user information is often gathered using the WKST (Workstation Service Remote Protocol) named pipe. By extending Impacket with the ability to respond to these requests, logged on users on a device can be spoofed, and arbitrary firewall rules applied.

We will dive into the details of how client probing has historically been a feature that should be avoided while introducing a new practical attack to emphasize that fact.

### You're Doing IoT RNG

45 minutes | Demo

#### Dan "AltF4" Petro Lead Researcher, Bishop Fox

#### Allan Cecil (dwangoAC)Security Consultant, Bishop Fox

Virtual only presentation

Think of a random number between '0' and infinity. Was your number '0'? Seriously? Crap. Well unfortunately, the hardware random number generators (RNG) used by your favorite IoT devices to create encryption keys may not work much better than you when it comes to randomness.
In this talk, we'll delve into murky design specs, opaque software libraries, and lots of empirical results. We wrote code for many popular IoT SoC platforms to extract gigabytes of data from their hardware RNGs and analyze them. What we found was a systemic minefield of vulnerabilities in almost every platform that could undermine IoT security. Something needs to change in how the Internet of Things does RNG.
The vulnerabilities are widespread and the attacks are practical. RNG is bad out there - "IoT Crypto-pocalypse" bad.

### Hacking the Apple AirTags

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Thomas Roth Hacker

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Apple’s AirTags enable tracking of personal belongings. They are the most recent
and cheapest device interacting with the Apple ecosystem. In contrast to other
tracking devices, they feature Ultrawide-band precise positioning and leverage
almost every other Apple device within the Find My localization network.

Less than 10 days after the AirTag release, we bypassed firmware protections by
glitching the nRF52 microcontroller. This opens the AirTags for firmware
analysis and modification. In this talk, we will explain the initial nRF52
bypass as well as various hacks built on top of this. In particular, AirTags can
now act as phishing device by providing malicious links via the NFC interface,
be cloned and appear at a completely different location, used without privacy
protections that should alert users as tracking protection, act as low-quality
microphone by reutilizing the accelerometer, and send arbitrary data via the
Find My network. Besides these malicious use cases, AirTags are now a research
platform that even allows access to the new Ultrawide-band chip U1.

### MAVSH> Attacking from Above

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Sach Hacker

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Over the course of 2020 and 2021, drone enthusiasts and the FAA have been locked in a series of legal battles over the future of unmanned aviation.

New regulations and restrictions, such as Remote Identification, aim to leave drone and model aviation hobbyists with a grim choice: incur countless financial costs, or lose the ability to fly freely.

Not only do these regulations impact hobbyists, they also restrict our ability to use drones as recon and payload delivery tools, but the FAA gave us a loophole.

In this talk, I'll share my knowledge of the MAVLink protocol and how it can be modified to take advantage of that loophole. I'll also show you how to build a drone capable of 20+ minute flights, potentially multiple miles of range, and hosting a Raspberry Pi 0 W onboard, enabling remote command execution without the use of onboard WiFi or cellular networks ALL while exploiting that loophole.

Come learn how and why the FAA "Can't Stop the Signal"!

### Adventures in MitM-land: Using Machine-in-the-Middle to Attack Active Directory Authentication Schemes

45 minutes | Demo

#### Sagi Sheinfeld Sr. Engineer, CrowdStrike

#### Eyal Karni Sr. Engineer, CrowdStrike

#### Yaron Zinar Sr. Manager, Engineering, CrowdStrike

Virtual only presentation

Over the years, researchers were able to break many secure protocols using MitM attacks. A common theme in this family of vulnerabilities is the lack of proper validation for any of the communicating parties. We will review previous MitM attacks found on AD authentication protocols and the mitigation strategies previously implemented. We will show that the relay attack technique is not limited to NTLM alone and can be used to attack the newer Kerberos authentication protocol. In addition, we will show several injection attacks compromising client systems. We’ll show how the lack of validation can lead to devastating issues ranging from authentication bypass to remote code execution on various critical infrastructure systems. However, the issues do not stop on Windows on-premises networks but span to other infrastructure such as domain-joined unix machines, virtualization infrastructure, open-source security audit tools and even cloud directories. The talk will deep-dive into multiple vulnerabilities we have discovered along with several demos. Demos include a MitM attack which allows an attacker to inject user passwords in a hybrid AD environment allowing the attacker to authenticate as any user in the network. We will also show how to use a similar technique to compromise many other IT infrastructure.

### Your House is My House: Use of Offensive Enclaves In Adversarial Operations

20 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Dimitry "Op\_Nomad" SnezhkovAssociate Director, Protiviti

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

As developers start to rely more on hardware-based memory encryption controls that isolate specific application code and data in memory - secure enclaves, adversaries can use enclaves to successfully coexist on the host and enjoy similar protections.

In this talk we venture into a practical implementation of such an offensive enclave, with the help of Intel SGX enclave technology, supported on a wide variety of processors present in enterprise data-centers and in the cloud.

We discuss how malware can avoid detection in defensively instrumented environments and protect their operational components from processes running at high privilege levels, including the Operating System. We dive deeper into using enclaves in implants and stagers, and discuss the design and implementation of an enclave that is capable of facilitating secure communication and storage of sensitive data in offensive operations. We cover how the enclaves can be built to help secure external communication while resisting system and network inspection efforts and to achieve deployment with minimal dependencies where possible.

Finally, we release the enclave code and a library of offensive enclave primitives as a useful reference for teams that leverage Intel SGX technology or have the hardware platform capable to support such adversarial efforts.

#### Dimitry "Op\_Nomad" SnezhkovAssociate Director, Protiviti

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Offensive testing in organizations has shown a tremendous value for simulating controlled attacks.
While cyber extortion may be one of the main high ROI end goals for the attacker, surprisingly few tools exist to simulate ransomware operations.

Racketeer is one such tool. It is an offensive agent coupled with a C2 base, built to help teams to prototype and exercise a tightly controlled ransomware campaign.

We walk through the design considerations and implementation of a ransomware implant which emulates logical steps taken to manage connectivity and asset encryption and decryption capabilities. We showcase flexible and actionable ways to prototype components of fully remote ransomware operation including key and data management, as well as data communication that is used in ransomware campaigns.

Racketeer is equipped with practical safeguards for lights out operations, and can address the goals of keeping strict control of data and key management in its deployment, including target containment policy, safe credential management, and implementing operational security in simulated operations.

Racketeer can help gain better optics into IoCs, and is helpful in providing detailed logs that can be used to study the behavior and execution artifacts of a ransomware agent.

### SPARROW: A Novel Covert Communication Scheme Exploiting Broadcast Signals in LTE, 5G & Beyond

45 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Reza Soosahabi Senior R&D Engineer, Keysight Technologies

#### Chuck McAuley Principal security researcher (ATIRC), at Keysight Technologies

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

When researching methods for covert communications in the wireless space, we noticed most hackers are barely looking below the IP layer, and even the wireless guys are focused on creating their own radio (PHY layer) solutions rather than looking at what’s already available to them. We discovered a sweet spot that takes advantage of MAC layer protocols in LTE and 5G, enabling long range communication using other people’s networks, GSMA CVD-2021-0045. We can use SPARROW devices almost everywhere in a variety of scenarios, such as data exfiltration and command and control. Despite limited data rates, the new scheme can defeat known covert communication schemes with dedicated PHY in the following ways:

- Maximum Anonymity: SPARROW devices do not authenticate with the host network while operating. This eliminates their exposure to network security and lawful intercept systems as well as spectrum scanners. Utilizing limited resources, they cause very minimal impact on the host network services.

- More Miles per Watt: SPARROW devices can be several miles apart exploiting broadcast power of base stations or non-terrestrial technologies. The range can be further extended by deploying several of them in a geographically sparse mesh network.

- Low Power & Low Complexity: SPARROW devices can utilize existing protocol implementation libraries installed on commodity SDRs. They can operate on batteries or harvest energy from the environment for long durations, just like real sparrows!

Browser extensions are installed anywhere, they serve as an integral part of our day-to-day web routine, from AdBlockers to Auto-Translators.
But - do we know what is running inside of them? Do we know what goes deep-down inside their communication routines?
How do they use their internal API’s? And how do their different JS execution contexts work?

In this session, I will explore these unique internal extension API’s, hidden attack-surfaces and show how these concepts can be broken & exploited using new ways!
I start showing how an attacker can "jump" from one low-permissions chrome-app/extension to another, hence elevating its permissions.
Then, I will show how to gain full "browser-persistency" inside extensions' background-scripts context.

Chaining it all together, I show how attacker, starting from low permissions chrome-app, gains a fully-armed "extension-rootkit",
a persistent JS-malware running inside of a “good” extension, along with C&C features, JS injection techniques to any tab/origin, obfuscation-techniques and more.
Eventually, I will present a generic technique, targeting all chrome-users, for taking over any previously installed chrome extension and implant an "extension-rootkit" in it.

### A new class of DNS vulnerabilities affecting many DNS-as-Service platforms

20 minutes | Demo

#### Shir Tamari Head of Research, Wiz (Wiz.io)

#### Ami Luttwak CTO, Wiz

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

We present a novel class of DNS vulnerabilities that affects multiple DNS-as-a-Service (DNSaaS) providers. The vulnerabilities have been proven and successfully exploited on three major cloud providers including AWS Route 53 and may affect many others. Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may allow exfiltration of sensitive information from service customers' corporate networks. The leaked information contains internal and external IP addresses, computer names, and sometimes NTLM hashes. The number of organizations vulnerable to this weakness is shocking. Over a few hours of DNS sniffing, we received sensitive information carried by DNS update queries from ~1M Windows endpoints from around 15,000 potentially vulnerable companies, including 15 Fortune 500 companies. In some organizations, there were more than 20,000 endpoints that actively leaked their information out of the organization. We will review possible mitigations to this problem and solutions for both DNSaaS providers and managed networks.

### UFOs: Misinformation, Disinformation, and the Basic Truth

45 minutes

#### Richard Thieme AKA neuralcowboy author and professional speaker, ThiemeWorks

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

The talk, "UFOs and Government: A Historical Inquiry" given at Def Con 21 has been viewed thousands of times. It was a serious well-documented exploration of the UFO subject based on Thieme's participation in research into the subject with colleagues. The book of that name is the gold standard for historical research into the subject and is in 100+ university libraries.

This update was necessitated by recent UFO incidents and the diverse conversations triggered by them. Contextual understanding is needed to evaluate current reports from pilots and naval personnel, statements from senators and Pentagon personnel, and indeed, all the input from journalists who are often unfamiliar with the field and the real history of documented UFOs over the past 70 years.

Thieme was privileged to participate with scholars and lifelong researchers into the massive trove of reports. We estimate that 95% can be explained by mundane phenomena but the remainder suggest prolonged interaction with our planetary society over a long period. Thieme also knows that when you know you don't know something, don't suggest that you do. Stay with the facts, stay with the data. Sensible conclusions, when we do that, are astonishing enough.

Reality, as Philip K. Dick said, will not go away just because we refuse to believe in it.

**Richard Thieme AKA neuralcowboy**
 Richard Thieme, https://thiemeworks.com has addressed security and intelligence issues for 28 years. He has keynoted security conferences in 15 countries and given presentations for the NSA, FBI, Secret Service, Pentagon Security Forum, U.S. Department of the Treasury, and Los Alamos National Laboratory. He has been speaking at Def Con since Def Con 4. His sixth book, a novel, Mobius: A Memoir, about an intelligence professional looking back on his career and how it led down unexpected paths, is receiving rave reviews. He has explored UFO phenomena seriously for 43 years.

### ProxyLogon is Just the Tip of the Iceberg, A New Attack Surface on Microsoft Exchange Server!

45 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Orange Tsai Principal Security Researcher of DEVCORE

Virtual only presentation

Microsoft Exchange Server is an email solution widely deployed within government and enterprises, and it is an integral part of both their daily operations and security. Needless to say, vulnerabilities in Exchange have long been the Holy Grail for attackers, hence our security research on Exchange. Surprisingly, we’ve found not only critical vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, but a whole new attack surface of Exchange.

This new attack surface is based on a significant change in Exchange Server 2013, where the fundamental protocol handler, Client Access Service (CAS), splits into frontend and backend. In this fundamental change of architecture, quite an amount of design debt was incurred, and, even worse, it introduced inconsistencies between contexts, leading us to discover this new attack surface.

To unveil the beauty of this attack surface and our novel exploitation, we’ll start by analyzing this architecture, followed by 7 vulnerabilities that consist of server-side bugs, client-side bugs, and crypto bugs found via this attack surface. In the end, these vulnerabilities are chained into 3 attack vectors that shine in different attack scenarios: ProxyLogon, ProxyShell, and ProxyOracle. These attack vectors enable any unauthenticated attacker to uncover plaintext passwords and even execute arbitrary code on Microsoft Exchange Servers through port 443, which is exposed to the Internet by ~400K Exchange Servers.

This attack surface has its unparalleled impact for a reason: security researchers tend to find vulnerabilities from a certain perspective, such as digging for memory bugs, injections, or logic flaws, but we took a different approach by looking at Exchange from a high-level architectural view and captured this architecture-level attack surface, which yielded multiple vulnerabilities. We hope this brings a new paradigm to vulnerability research and inspires more security researchers to look into Exchange Server. Last but not least, we’ll provide hardening actions to mitigate such types of 0days in Exchange.

### Sneak into buildings with KNXnet/IP

45 minutes | Demo

#### Claire Vacherot Senior Security Auditor @ Orange Cyberdefense

Virtual only presentation

Building Management Systems control a myriad of devices such as lighting, shutters and HVAC. KNX (and by extension KNXnet/IP) is a common protocol used to interact with these BMS. However, the public's understanding and awareness is lacking, and effective tooling is scarce all while the BMS device market keeps on growing.

The ability to craft arbitrary KNXnet/IP frames to interact with these often-insecure BMS provides an excellent opportunity in uncovering vulnerabilities in both the implementation of KNX as well as the protocol itself. From unpacking KNX at a lower level, to using a Python-based protocol crafting framework we developed to interact with KNXnet/IP implementations, in this talk we’ll go on a journey of discovering how BMS that implement KNXnet/IP work as well as how to interact with and fuzz them.

After this talk you could also claim that “the pool on the roof has a leak”!

### Timeless Timing Attacks

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Tom Van Goethem Researcher, KU Leuven

#### Mathy Vanhoef Postdoctoral Researcher, NYU

Virtual only presentation

25 years ago, the first timing attacks against well-known cryptosystems such as RSA and Diffie-Hellman were introduced. By carefully measuring the execution time of crypto operations, an attacker could infer the bits of the secret. Ever since, timing attacks have frequently resurfaced, leading to many vulnerabilities in various applications and cryptosystems that do not have constant-time execution. As networks became more stable and low-latency, it soon became possible to perform these timing attacks over an Internet connection, potentially putting millions of devices at risk. However, attackers still face the challenge of overcoming the jitter that is incurred on the network path, as it obfuscates the real timing values. Up until now, an adversary would have to collect thousands or millions of measurements to infer a single bit of information.

In this presentation, we introduce a conceptually novel way of performing timing attacks that is completely resilient to network jitter. This means that remote timing attacks can now be executed with a performance and accuracy that is similar as if the attack was performed on the local system. With this technique, which leverages coalescing of network packets and request multiplexing, it is possible to detect timing differences as small as 100ns over any Internet connection. We will elaborate on how this technique can be launched against HTTP/2 webservers, Tor onion services, and EAP-pwd, a popular Wi-Fi authentication method.

### Central bank digital currency, threats and vulnerabilities

45 minutes | Exploit

#### Ian Vitek Security, Sveriges Riksbank (Central bank of Sweden)

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

What are the threats and vulnerabilities of a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC)? The central bank of Sweden has built a prototype of a retail CBDC system and I will run through the procurement requirements and design and point out where a two-tier CBDC need protection against attacks. The prototype is built on Corda Token SDK and I have during tests found reliable ways to exploit weaknesses in the design. The presentation will focus on the vulnerabilities that can crash the service that handles the tokens and permanently lock tokens rendering tokens and digital wallets useless. The presentation will also go into detail how tokens are validated and how information from all earlier transactions is needed for this. With D3.js and HTML5 I will visualize the token history (backchain) and describe how this can be a problem with GDPR and the Swedish bank secrecy regulation.

The presentation will end with a summary of identified threats and weaknesses of a two-tier retail central bank digital currency prototype and how to handle them.
The goal of the presentation is to give the attendees insight of the security implications, challenges depending on the design and where an attack can be carried out and everything that cannot be missed when designing a CBDC.

### Breaking Secure Bootloaders

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Christopher Wade Security Consultant at Pen Test Partners

Virtual only presentation

Bootloaders often use signature verification mechanisms in order to protect a device from executing malicious software. This talk aims to outline actionable weaknesses in modern bootloaders which allow attackers to deploy unsigned code, despite these protection mechanisms.

In the first phase of this talk, we will discuss exploitation of the bootloaders in modern Android smartphones, demonstrating weaknesses which allow for bypassing bootloader unlocking restrictions, decryption of protected user data, and deployment of malicious software to devices using full disk encryption.

In the second phase, we will discuss bootloader weaknesses in the secondary hardware used by smartphones. Using an embedded RF chip as a target, we will demonstrate reverse engineering techniques which identified weaknesses in the signature verification mechanisms of the firmware update protocols used by the bootloader, allowing for deployment of custom firmware to the chip.

### Defending against nation-state (legal) attack: how to build a privacy-protecting service in the era of ubiquitous surveillance

45 minutes

#### Bill "Woody" Woodcock Chair of the Foundation Council, Quad9

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

US diplomacy and the US District Court of Northern California provide a nearly impenetrable shield against legal assault from other countries for the many tech companies that choose the San Francisco Bay Area as their legal domicile. But US domicile has left companies undefended against ECPA, CALEA, Patriot Act and FISA requests and the gag orders which prevent their disclosure, and the US has little or no statutory protections for users’ privacy. So how do you hack the international legal and diplomatic system to defend the privacy of users of Internet services against nation-state legal attacks? The privacy-and-security-oriented non-profit DNS recursive resolver Quad9 spent four years working the system and learning from prior examples like ProtonMail, and Bill Woodcock, the chair of Quad9’s Foundation Council, will talk about the threat model Quad9 is defending against, how legal domicile and physical presence interact, and how Quad9 is building a model that other privacy-respecting services can follow. He’ll discuss the critical differences between jurisdictions and legal regimes that Quad9 uncovered in their four-year selection process, and the key and differentiating protections the Swiss government offers that the US and EU governments do not. And if y’all get tired of that, you might be able to convince him to talk about the injunction Sony Music got against Quad9 in the copyright-troll court in Hamburg and why more privacy may also come at the risk of more censorship.

### How I use a JSON Deserialization 0day to Steal Your Money On The Blockchain

45 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Hao Xing Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab

#### Zekai Wu Security Researcher from Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab

Virtual only presentation

Fastjson is a widely used open source JSON parser with 23'100 stars on GitHub. As a basic module of countless java web services, it serves hundreds of millions of users. We managed to find a way to bypass many security checks and mitigations by using the inheritance process of some basic classes, and achieve remote code execution successfully. We will disclose these high-risk and universal gadgets for the first time in this talk.

Now, we can control many important websites and affect millions of users. Let's make things more interesting. We found that this fastjson vulnerability affect a multi-billion-dollar blockchain. We designed multiple complex gadgets based on the features of the blockchain, and exquisitely achieved information leakage and pointer hijacking. Putting all these gadgets together, we achieved remote code execution on the blockchain nodes.

However, generally after remote code execution, we seem to have no better exploit method other than the 51% attack, which will lead to serious accounting confusion. After a detailed analysis of the architecture design of the public blockchain, we found a way from RCE to steal the public blockchain users' assets almost without any notification.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published attack case on the realization of covertly stealing user assets after RCE on the public blockchain nodes. We will propose a more covert post penetration exploit method for public blockchain nodes in this talk.

Blockchain is not bulletproof to security vulnerability. We will show you how to use classical web vulnerabilities attack the blockchain and how to steal real money from the decentralized cyber world.

### Glitching RISC-V chips: MTVEC corruption for hardening ISA

45 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Adam 'pi3' Zabrocki Principal System Software Engineer (Offensive Security) at NVIDIA

#### Alex Matrosov

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) provided under open-source licenses that do not require fees to use. ISA is based on established reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. RISC-V has features to increase computer speed, while reducing cost and power use.

Many industry players like Google, IBM, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and Samsung are members of the RISC-V Foundation and have long supported RISC-V development. In 2016, NVIDIA unveiled plans to replace the internal microcontrollers of their graphic cards with next-gen RISC-V-based controllers built for upcoming NVIDIA GPUs.

NVIDIA's Product Security undertook a detailed architectural analysis and research of the RISC-V IP, discovering a potential risk with the ambiguous specification of the Machine Trap Base Address (MTVEC) register. This ambiguity leads to potential fault injection vulnerabilities under physical attack models.

**Adam 'pi3' Zabrocki**
 Adam 'pi3' Zabrocki is a computer security researcher, pentester and bughunter, currently working as a Principal Offensive Security Researcher at NVIDIA. He is a creator and a developer of Linux Kernel Runtime Guard (LKRG) - his moonlight project defended by Openwall. Among others, he used to work in Microsoft, European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), HISPASEC Sistemas (known from the virustotal.com project), Wroclaw Center for Networking and Supercomputing, Cigital. The main area of his research interest is a low-level security (CPU architecture, uCode, FW, hypervisor, kernel, OS).

As a hobby, he was a developer in The ERESI Reverse Engineering Software Interface project, a bughunter (discovered vulnerabilities in Hyper-V hypervisor, Intel/NVIDIA vGPU, Linux kernel, OpenSSH, gcc SSP/ProPolice, Apache, Adobe Acrobat Reader, Xpdf, Torque GRID server, FreeBSD, and more) and studied exploitation and mitigation techniques, publishing results of his research in Phrack Magazine.

## Description

![@bradfitz](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2621?u=6deb06d9916328265486504f364c80ec2d969f2c&v=4&size=48)[bradfitz](https://github.com/bradfitz)opened [on Dec 26, 2020](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/43389#issue-774903681)

Maybe net.ParseIP shouldn't successfully parse IP addresses out of unbounded inputs?

e.g. `fmt.Println(net.ParseIP(strings.Repeat("0", 10<<20) + "000000192.0000168.00000.00001"))` passes, as does UnmarshalText (<https://play.golang.org/p/bXGEzOS6KVQ>)

Of course, in both those cases the data is already fully in memory, so most the harm has been done if this is attacker-controlled.

Still, a bit surprising. Intentional?

Some parsers reject past 3 digits per octet, so `196.168.020.001` is valid, but not `0196.0168.0020.0001`.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 497 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [January 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2832416.1).

**Please note that on December 10, 2021, Oracle released a Security Alert for Apache Log4j vulnerabilities [CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2021-44228.html). Customers should review the Alert if they have not already done so.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.
