Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-29621:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a timing discrepancy in the authentication process of Flask-AppBuilder when using database authentication. Specifically, the time it takes to respond to a login attempt varies depending on whether the provided username exists or not.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Timing Attack:** The application exhibits a timing side channel that allows an attacker to discern the existence of usernames by observing the response time during the login process. The code added a check_password_hash call with a dummy password to balance the time taken for failed logins to be similar to successful logins. However, this was only applied to cases where the user was not found, and not when the user is inactive.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **User Enumeration:** A non-authenticated attacker can exploit this timing difference to enumerate valid usernames within the application's database. This information can then be used for further attacks, such as password brute-forcing.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Login Interface:** The primary attack vector is the login interface of the Flask-AppBuilder application. An attacker can repeatedly attempt logins with different usernames and observe the response time to determine if the username exists.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application's login interface.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or valid credentials to perform the user enumeration.
