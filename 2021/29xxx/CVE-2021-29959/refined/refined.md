Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-29959:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how Firefox manages permissions for camera and microphone access when both devices are requested together using `getUserMedia`. Specifically, when a website requests both camera and microphone access, Firefox creates a single "SourceListener" (later renamed to DeviceListener). The "recording-device-stopped" event was only fired when this entire SourceListener was removed, which only occurs when all tracks obtained from that `getUserMedia` call were stopped. Consequently, if one of the tracks was kept alive (e.g., the microphone), stopping the other track (e.g., camera) wouldn't trigger the permission revocation, allowing the website to re-enable the camera without prompting the user again.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Inconsistent permission handling: Firefox incorrectly treated camera and microphone permissions as a pair when obtained through a single `getUserMedia` call, instead of managing them separately.
- Insufficient permission revocation: The `recording-device-stopped` event was not triggered when individual tracks from a `getUserMedia` call were stopped if other tracks from the same call were still active.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized camera reactivation: A malicious website, having obtained initial permission to access both camera and microphone, could trick users by turning off the camera (and the camera hardware light) while maintaining the microphone active. This allows the site to then re-enable the camera without user consent. This could lead to unexpected surveillance.

**Attack Vectors:**
1. A website requests camera and microphone access via `getUserMedia`, and the user grants the permission without selecting "Remember this decision".
2. The website stops the camera track but keeps the microphone track active. This causes the camera light to turn off.
3. The website re-enables the camera without a new permission prompt.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to serve web content to the victim via a website or web application.
- The victim must have previously granted the website permission to use their camera and microphone.
- The attacker needs to keep the microphone track active while stopping and restarting the camera track.
