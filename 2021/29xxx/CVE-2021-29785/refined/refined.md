- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) headers for some endpoints in IBM Security SOAR.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of HSTS headers allows for potential HTTPS downgrade attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful downgrade attacks can expose users to man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially leading to data breaches, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks where an attacker intercepts communication between the client and the IBM Security SOAR server and forces a downgrade from HTTPS to HTTP, or exploits the lack of HSTS to prevent the browser from upgrading to HTTPS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Man-in-the-middle attacker with the ability to intercept network traffic between the client and the IBM Security SOAR server.
