Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29012:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in session management. Specifically, when an admin user logs out, their session cookie is not invalidated or changed. Instead, it's temporarily disabled until the admin logs back in. The cookie remains the same, allowing for reuse.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Broken Session Management:** Session cookies are not properly invalidated upon logout, allowing for reuse. This violates the principle of least privilege and exposes the application to session hijacking.
*   **Predictable Session IDs:** The session cookie does not change between login sessions.
*   **Insufficient access control:** The lack of proper validation or invalidation of session tokens when a user logs out allows attackers to use old session tokens.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can impersonate an administrator by reusing a stolen session cookie, even if the administrator is not currently logged in, as long as they eventually log back in.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can make requests on behalf of the admin user, potentially gaining full control over the system or sensitive data.
*   **Chaining with other vulnerabilities:** This vulnerability can be chained with other vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-29011) to steal session cookies, amplifying the impact.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Session Cookie Theft:**  An attacker needs to steal a valid session cookie, which can be done through Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other methods.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker then modifies HTTP request headers by changing the session cookie parameter to that of the stolen cookie.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Access to Radius Management web interface:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the Radius Management web interface.
*   **Ability to steal session cookie:** This can be achieved through vulnerabilities like XSS (as shown by the content provided) or other network-based attacks.
*   **Basic understanding of HTTP request manipulation:** The attacker needs to modify the cookie header in their requests.
*   **Time-based attack:** The attacker must make their requests while the admin user is logged in, or after they have logged in again since the session token is still valid.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided document details a proof of concept using XSS to steal an admin's cookie, which is then used to exploit the broken session management vulnerability.
*   The vulnerable system is implied to be a Radius Management web interface, but the specific application isn't named in this context.
*   The session cookie is referenced as "PHPSESSID" which may indicate the system is built using PHP.
* The content provides more detail on how to exploit the vulnerability than the official CVE description, which is a placeholder.
