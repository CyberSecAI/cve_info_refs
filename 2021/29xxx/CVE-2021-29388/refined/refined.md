Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** While the provided content does not directly mention CVE-2021-29388, it does describe a vulnerability that was assigned the EDB-ID 49723. Since the CVE is a placeholder, this analysis will focus on the identified vulnerability from EDB-ID 49723

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization when handling the "Budget title" within the Budget Management System. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores user-supplied input (the "Budget title") without adequate sanitization. This injected script is then executed when other users view the budget details.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Cookie Stealing:** Attackers can use the XSS vulnerability to steal user cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Malicious Redirection:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites, potentially leading to further compromise (e.g., phishing, malware downloads).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The attacker inputs the malicious script through the "Budget title" field on the web application's interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application by adding or updating budget titles. No special privileges are needed, making this a relatively low-skill exploit. The attacker does not need any special network position besides accessing the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The "Budget title" input field.
*   **Payload Example:** `<script>alert(1)</script>`
*   The exploit is triggered when the page displaying the budget or the updated budget is loaded in a web browser

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was tested on Windows 10 with XAMPP 8.0.3.
* The vulnerable application is "Budget Management System 1.0"
* The application is available from sourcecodester.com at the provided URL

**Summary:** The content from exploit-db.com describes a stored XSS vulnerability in a PHP-based Budget Management System. By injecting a malicious script into the "Budget title" field, an attacker can steal cookies or redirect users to malicious sites. This vulnerability is due to a lack of input sanitization, making it a common type of web application flaw.
