Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-29546:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an integer division by zero in the `QuantizedBiasAdd` operation within TensorFlow. The code divides the number of elements in the input tensor by the number of elements in the smaller input (bias) tensor, without verifying that the divisor (number of elements in the bias tensor) is not zero.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer division by zero. This is a classic example of undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  The division by zero leads to undefined behavior, potentially causing a crash or other unexpected outcomes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by crafting input tensors with a zero number of elements for the bias tensor during the execution of the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedBiasAdd` operation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the shape of the input and bias tensors being passed to `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedBiasAdd`.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability exists within the Eigen kernel implementation used by TensorFlow for the `QuantizedBiasAdd` operation.
- The provided code snippet demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability.
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the number of elements in the bias tensor is not zero before performing the division.
- The issue has been patched in TensorFlow versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2 and will be included in 2.5.0.
- The GitHub commit [67784700869470d65d5f2ef20aeb5e97c31673cb](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/67784700869470d65d5f2ef20aeb5e97c31673cb) provides the fix, adding a check for a zero bias tensor.
