Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29951:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Mozilla Maintenance Service on Windows incorrectly granted `SERVICE_START` and `SERVICE_STOP` access to the `BUILTIN\Users` group. This group includes all authenticated users, including remote users on a domain network.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Access Control:** The service's security descriptor allowed any authenticated user, including remote domain users, to start or stop the Mozilla Maintenance Service.
- **Exposed Attack Surface:** Allowing remote users to control the service exposed the service's command-line handling to potential abuse. Specifically, the service's start operation takes a command line, which influences the update operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could repeatedly send "stop" commands to the service, preventing the browser update service from functioning.
- **Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The exposed command-line interface of the service could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges, if combined with other vulnerabilities. This is due to the service potentially misinterpreting command line arguments, as stated "has been a source of numerous bugs in the past."
- **Note:** The risk is mitigated on Windows 10 build 1709 and later due to a Microsoft mitigation, but this mitigation is not present in Windows 7 or 8.x, and could be disabled by administrators on newer versions.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Access:** Attackers exploit the Windows Service Control Manager via network connections, which allows remote users to start/stop services they have permissions for.
- **Domain Networks:** The vulnerability is most severe on domain networks, where most users can authenticate to other workstations or servers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the target machine.
- **Domain User Credentials:** The attacker must have valid domain user credentials to authenticate to the target system.
- **Windows version:** The target needs to be a Windows OS older than Win 10 build 1709, unless the mitigation has been disabled manually.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix involves changing the access control to the `NT AUTHORITY\INTERACTIVE` group instead of `BUILTIN\Users`. This restricts access to interactive logins (including RDP), excluding network logins.
- A proof of concept (PoC) was provided, which demonstrated the ability to remotely start the maintenance service.
- The vulnerability was initially found by James Forshaw and was addressed in Firefox 87 and Firefox ESR 78.10.1 and Thunderbird 78.10.1.
- The bug report mentions that this vulnerability could lead to system RCE if combined with other bugs.
