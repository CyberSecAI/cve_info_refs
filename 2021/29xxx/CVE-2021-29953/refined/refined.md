Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29953:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from how Firefox for Android (Fenix) handles stacked pop-up prompts generated by the `window.open()` method. When multiple such prompts are created, and the user navigates away from the page, not all prompts are dismissed. Specifically, only one prompt is dismissed on navigation, while others remain. If the user then accepts such a remaining prompt, it opens with the new page as its "opener".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper prompt dismissal:** The core issue lies in the failure to properly dismiss all stacked pop-up prompts upon page navigation. This leaves residual prompts active and exploitable.
*   **"opener" relationship exploitation:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit the relationship between the newly opened pop-up window and its opener (the navigated-to page).
*   **JavaScript URI handling:** Specifically, using `javascript:` URLs within the prompts allows malicious code to be injected and executed within the context of the opener page, bypassing same-origin policy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Universal Cross-Site Scripting (UXSS):** By injecting and executing malicious JavaScript code through the residual pop-up prompt, an attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's currently viewed webpage, resulting in UXSS.
*   **Access to opener page's data:** The attacker's JavaScript code can access and manipulate the "opener" page, which would not normally be allowed due to the browser's security policies.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A malicious web page can use the `window.open()` method to generate multiple pop-up prompts with `javascript:` URLs.
*   The user is then forced to navigate away from the page while these popups remain open.
*   If the user interacts with the remaining prompt (e.g. accepting it), the attacker's injected JavaScript code is executed within the context of the new page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage that can generate multiple pop-up prompts with `javascript:` URLs.
*   The attacker needs to lure the user to visit the malicious page using social engineering or other methods.
*   The attacker does not require any specific privileges on the user's system.
*   The user must be using Firefox for Android.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability is specific to Firefox for Android (Fenix), other operating systems are unaffected.
*   The issue was addressed by ensuring that stacked prompts are not allowed, and that prompts are automatically dismissed on navigation.
* The fix was included in Firefox for Android 88.1.3 and Firefox 88.0.1.
* The bug report also mentions that this vulnerability could be combined with a denial-of-service vulnerability (bug 1701673) where a page can produce a large number of pop-up prompts to force the user to accept the pop-up in an attempt to unlock the UI.
