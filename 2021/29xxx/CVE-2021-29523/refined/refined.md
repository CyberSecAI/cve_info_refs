Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29523:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow within the `TensorShape` constructor in TensorFlow. When constructing a `TensorShape` using the `sparse_shape` parameter in `tf.raw_ops.AddManySparseToTensorsMap`, the dimensions are multiplied together to calculate the total number of elements. If this multiplication results in an integer overflow (a negative value), a `CHECK` failure is triggered.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow during `TensorShape` construction when multiplying dimensions in the shape.
- Improper handling of potential integer overflows during tensor shape calculation which leads to `CHECK` failures.
- Use of legacy implementation of the constructor that doesn't prevent `CHECK` failures.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The `CHECK` failure causes the TensorFlow process to terminate, leading to a denial-of-service condition. This is triggered by passing specially crafted `sparse_shape` argument that results in the calculation overflow.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by calling the `tf.raw_ops.AddManySparseToTensorsMap` operation with a `sparse_shape` argument that will cause an integer overflow during calculation of the shape's number of elements.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to control the `sparse_shape` parameter in the `tf.raw_ops.AddManySparseToTensorsMap` operation. This would typically require the ability to construct and execute TensorFlow graphs.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability exists because the `TensorShape` constructor directly uses `InitDims` which uses `MultiplyWithoutOverflow`, but doesn't properly handle the overflow return, resulting in a crash.
- The fix involves adding a check for overflow before constructing `TensorShape` from input and use `BuildTensorShapeBase` or `AddDimWithStatus` to properly handle overflows during `TensorShape` calculations.
- The vulnerable code is located in `tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_tensors_map_ops.cc` and `tensorflow/core/framework/tensor_shape.cc` in the TensorFlow repository.
- The fix is present in the commit `69c68ecbb24dff3fa0e46da0d16c821a2dd22d7c` of the TensorFlow repository.
