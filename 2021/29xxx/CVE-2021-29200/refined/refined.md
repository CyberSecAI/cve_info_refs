- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unsafe deserialization of Java objects using RMI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to insecure deserialization, which can lead to remote code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the vulnerable server.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exposed through Java serialization using RMI, which is accessible by an unauthenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require authentication and needs to be able to send serialized malicious objects through RMI to the vulnerable server.
