# Description

The ManageWiki API allows viewing of sensitive information set as visible to only ManageWiki right users (such as Discord webhooks)

This should be fixed immediately, likely by either creating another configuration variable to hide specific settings from the API, or by reverting ManageWiki changes to even support this, and move Discord webhooks back to PrivateSettings.php (which I really would rather not go that route as it's nice to allow users to add their own, and for support with other configs)

You mean the commits I did and PR paladox opened? If so then no because the private config is set as an option key from within MWS.php, and therefore the api can't really read it the same so I introduced a whole new config variable for the API to read.

But SpecialManageWiki can access it so why can't API do the same and just not emit it. That's a mistake waiting to happen.

Technically it probably could but it'd have to read the entire ManageWikiSettings config and check for the right keys, this seemed better.

I disagree. It's an extra step to think about and introduces a risk.

If this can’t be done as a single source of truth, my personal opinion would be to get rid of public/private settings until they can be done safely and securely.

Well what about other scenarios also, there can be multiple reasons configs shouldn't be shown in API rather then that one key, this allows multiple reasons without adding hard coded checks for them all.

Thats fair and overall its up to the tech team. I'm only trying to fix a mistake but removing the private/public configs I really disagree with as it is hard to revert back to PrivateSettings.php (which of course if wanted it can be done) but also allowing users to manage it themselves is essential, but I guess its just opinion. Ots your choice.

It seems that the visibility check is awkwardly implemented if each interface that exposes a setting needs to independently check the visibility.

Also (somewhat related): The PSA for the Discord/Slack hook security issue is probably of no interest for vast majority of the users: only Bureaucrats can act on the stuff, and the readers from external links don't even care if there's discord or slack stuff. It is probably a wise idea to implement some hacks (i.e. Wikimedia Stewards Election Call for Candidates CN banner which is only displayed if you have sysop on the wiki) so those who are simply not affected can skip it even further. (Or think of a better way to alert crats without relying on sitenotice/CN)

Yeah I was actually thinking about that also. But I think it is OK if the site notice is up for only a day or 2, anything beyond that I think what you suggested should be done.

True, ManageWikiSettings really should have this and by default be configured to display only non private settings. This would be one of numerous improvement to the security and reliability of this feature set.

👍 to this idea, to allowing us to set the visibility to only local bureaucrats. There could be several ways to do this, I think.

The ManageWiki API currently allows viewing of sensitive information set as visible to only ManageWiki right users, such as Discord and Slack webhooks. This fixes it by adding a check to the API, to hide it if the config has set `$wgManageWikiSettings[SETTING]['requires']['visibility']['permissions']` so information on sensitive settings are never displayed via the API.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
