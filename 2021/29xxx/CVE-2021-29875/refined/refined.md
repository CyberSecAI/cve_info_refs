Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29875:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure third-party domain access within IBM InfoSphere Information Server. Specifically, it relates to how WebSphere Application Server (WAS) cookies are configured and handled. The issue is that the default configuration for certain cookies (LTPAToken2 and JSESSIONID) allows for visibility across different parts of the domain, which can lead to security issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Cookie Path:** The `LTPAToken2` cookies are set to the root path, making them visible across all applications on the domain. This allows unintended access if the cookie is exposed. The `JSESSIONID` cookie was also potentially lacking a specific path, increasing its vulnerability.
*   **Lack of Specific Cookie Path:** The absence of a specific path for `JSESSIONID` cookies means they are potentially visible to other applications on the same server or domain, which could be leveraged in a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker might be able to gain unauthorized access to user sessions by intercepting or using exposed cookie values. This could lead to data breaches or the ability to impersonate users.
*   **Session Hijacking:** By obtaining valid cookie information, an attacker could hijack a user's active session, allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the legitimate user.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If an attacker can inject malicious code through manipulating cookies, this could lead to XSS attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Interception:** An attacker could intercept network traffic to capture cookie values.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** XSS can be used to steal or manipulate cookie values.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker could conduct a MitM attack to intercept the cookies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to intercept traffic.
*   **Local Network Access:** In certain cases, such as MitM attacks, the attacker needs to be in the same local network.
*   **Ability to Inject Malicious Code (XSS):** An attacker may need the ability to inject malicious code if they attempt to leverage XSS for cookie manipulation.
*   **Knowledge of WebSphere Application Server:** An attacker would need to understand how WAS cookies work and how to exploit the lack of specific cookie paths.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects IBM InfoSphere Information Server version 11.7.
*   The fix involves updating the cookie path for the `JSESSIONID` cookie to `/ibm/iis` for both WAS Network Deployment and WAS Liberty.
*   The fix for `LTPAToken2` involves changing cookie names on servers so they are not visible from the other servers that did not change the cookie name.
*   The bulletin provides specific instructions on how to configure the cookie paths in both WAS Network Deployment and WAS Liberty environments.

This vulnerability allows for potentially unauthorized access or session hijacking due to incorrectly configured cookie paths for WebSphere Application Server, within the context of IBM InfoSphere Information Server.
