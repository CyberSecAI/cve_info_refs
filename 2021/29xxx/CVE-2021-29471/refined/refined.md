Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29471:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from inefficient processing of certain patterns in the push rule matching engine of `matrix-synapse`. Specifically, complex patterns involving multiple wildcards (`*` and `?`) in the `event_match` condition of push rules can lead to extremely poor performance.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inefficient Regex Generation:** The `glob_to_regex` function, responsible for converting glob-like patterns into regular expressions, generates regex patterns that are computationally expensive to evaluate when dealing with multiple wildcards.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The system does not have proper input validation for push rule patterns, allowing users to create rules that trigger the inefficient matching behavior.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The inefficient processing of certain push rule patterns can cause a denial-of-service by consuming excessive server resources (CPU and/or memory) when processing incoming events that trigger these rules.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** A malicious user can create push rules with specially crafted patterns that cause the server to become unresponsive due to high CPU and memory usage. This prevents legitimate users from using the service.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to resource exhaustion on the server hosting `matrix-synapse`, potentially affecting other services on the same machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Push Rules:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating malicious push rules with specific patterns designed to trigger the inefficient regex matching behavior.
*   **Event Trigger:** Once these rules are in place, the DoS is triggered when a user sends or receives an event that matches one of the crafted patterns.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to modify push rules:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify push rules for a user or potentially even at a server-wide level, if that functionality is exposed.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable patterns:** The attacker needs to be aware of the specific pattern structures that lead to poor performance.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by optimizing the `glob_to_regex` function to handle multiple wildcards more efficiently, as seen in the provided commit `03318a766cac9f8b053db2214d9c332a977d226c`. The changes involve simplifying the wildcard representation in the regular expressions generated from globs.
*   The fix also involves adding word boundary support to `glob_to_regex`, which was previously missing.
*   The `_glob_to_re` helper function was removed in favor of the optimized `glob_to_regex` function.
*   The vulnerability is specific to how Synapse handles patterns in push rule conditions, especially those with `event_match` conditions.
*   The vulnerability was patched in `matrix-synapse` version 1.33.2 and later.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Fedora update notification indicates that this vulnerability was addressed in `matrix-synapse-1.38.1-1.fc34`.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" severity.
*   A potential workaround is to block custom push rule requests at a reverse-proxy, but the recommended action is to upgrade `matrix-synapse`.
*   The provided Github commit adds tests for push rule pattern matching and for acl pattern matching, among other changes.
