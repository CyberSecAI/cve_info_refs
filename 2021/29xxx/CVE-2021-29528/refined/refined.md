Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29528:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a division by zero error within the `VectorTensorMultiply` function in the `tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_mul_op.cc` file.
- Specifically, the code calculates the index `vector_i` using the modulo operator (`%`) with `vector_num_elements` as the divisor, as shown: `const int64 vector_i = i % vector_num_elements;`
- If `vector_num_elements` is zero, this will result in division by zero.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Division by Zero:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation to ensure that `vector_num_elements` is not zero before performing the modulo operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger a division by zero error by providing an input tensor with zero elements, leading to a crash or termination of the TensorFlow process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedMul` operation.
- An attacker can craft a TensorFlow graph or input data using this operation, with a zero sized vector as an input, to trigger the division by zero.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to define and execute TensorFlow operations, by calling `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedMul`.
- The attacker needs the ability to control the size of one of the input tensors.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by adding a check to verify `vector_num_elements` is not zero.
- The fix is included in TensorFlow versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2, and 2.5.0.
