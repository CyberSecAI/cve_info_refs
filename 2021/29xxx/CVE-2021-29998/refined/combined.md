WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Avoid the use of the DHCP client if unnecessary to your environment.

• If the DHCP client is enabled, it is recommended to disable it.

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

RUGGEDCOM WIN products are used as base stations or subscriber units in wide area private wireless
networks. The products are compliant to the IEEE 802.16e standard and can be operated in harsh
environments.

SCALANCE X switches are used to connect industrial components like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs).

SIMATIC RF181EIP

SIMATIC RF182C is an RFID communication module for direct connection of SIMATIC identiﬁcation
systems to Ethernet/IP. SIMATIC RF182C is superseded by the SIMATIC RF18xC devices (RF185C,
RF186C, RF188C).

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-29998

There is a DHCP vulnerability in Wind River VxWorks, for versions prior to 6.5. The vulnerability could
cause a possible heap overﬂow if exploited.

## 5. MITIGATIONS

Siemens recommends that the affected product versions listed as “All versions prior to v4.1.4” to [Update to v4.1.4 or later](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109808359/).

* Avoid the use of the DHCP client if unnecessary to your environment.
* If the DHCP client is enabled, it is recommended to disable it.

**--------- Begin Update C Part 2 of 2 ---------**

For SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives:

* Contact Siemens customer support for detailed instructions to remediate the issue in affected drives.
* Disable the DHCP client and use a static IP address configuration instead.
* Ensure the drive internal network is not externally connected (the default drive configuration as described in the operational manual).
* For more information see [SSA-910883](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-910883.pdf)

**--------- End Update C Part 2 of 2 ---------**

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens Operational Guidelines for Industrial Security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>.

For more information about this vulnerability and the associated remediations, please see [Siemens publication number SSA-560465](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-560465.pdf).

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.

SUMMARY

Several models of SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives are affected by a DHCP client
vulnerability (CVE-2021-29998) in the integrated SCALANCE X206-1 device. The vulnerability could
allow an attacker to cause a heap-based buffer overﬂow on that device and use it to get access to the
drive’s internal network.

The list of affected drive models can be found in the section “Additional Information” below.

Recently manufactured drives are no longer affected. For older drives, Siemens provides detailed
remediation advise via customer support.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Disable the DHCP client and use static IP address conﬁguration instead
• Ensure that the drive internal network is not externally connected (which is the default conﬁguration

in all drives as described in the operational manual)

Product speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 medium voltage drive family is used to control a wide
variety of medium voltage converters or inverters in different applications.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-29998

There is a DHCP vulnerability in Wind River VxWorks, for versions prior to 6.5. The vulnerability could
