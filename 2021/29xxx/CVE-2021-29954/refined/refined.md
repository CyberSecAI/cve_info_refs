Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The proxy functionality in Hubs Cloud's Reticulum software was misconfigured to be overly permissive. It allowed access to internal URLs, including the AWS metadata service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Proxy Configuration:** The proxy did not properly restrict access to internal resources.
- **Exposure of Internal URLs:** The proxy allowed requests to internal URLs, specifically the AWS metadata service.
- **Credential Exposure:** The metadata service provides access to temporary AWS credentials associated with the Hubs Cloud instance.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Access to AWS Resources:** Attackers could obtain AWS access keys, secret keys, and tokens.
- **Unauthorized Actions:** With these credentials, attackers could perform any actions that the compromised AWS role was authorized to do. This included:
    - Modifying or deleting assets stored in S3 buckets.
    - Modifying JavaScript files, potentially injecting malicious code to be delivered to users.
    - Potentially gaining access to other resources controlled by the compromised AWS account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to reach the Hubs Cloud CORS proxy URL.
- **URL Manipulation:** By crafting specific URLs, attackers could access the AWS metadata service through the insecure proxy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs knowledge of a specific Hubs Cloud installation's domain name.
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the CORS proxy URL for that Hubs Cloud installation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was patched in Hubs Cloud version `mozillareality/reticulum/1.0.1/20210428201255`.
- Mozilla provided instructions for customers to check their logs for signs of exploitation using `journalctl`.
- The bug report includes a detailed step-by-step procedure on how to reproduce the vulnerability and gain access to the AWS credentials.
- The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2021-29954.
- The report indicates that a security bug bounty was awarded.
