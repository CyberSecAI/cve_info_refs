# Heap buffer overflow in `QuantizedMul`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-m3f9-w3p3-p669
May 13, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.2

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow in `QuantizedMul` by passing in invalid thresholds for the quantization:

```
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.constant([256, 328], shape=[1, 2], dtype=tf.quint8)
y = tf.constant([256, 328], shape=[1, 2], dtype=tf.quint8)
min_x = tf.constant([], dtype=tf.float32)
max_x = tf.constant([], dtype=tf.float32)
min_y = tf.constant([], dtype=tf.float32)
max_y = tf.constant([], dtype=tf.float32)

tf.raw_ops.QuantizedMul(x=x, y=y, min_x=min_x, max_x=max_x, min_y=min_y, max_y=max_y)
```

This is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/87cf4d3ea9949051e50ca3f071fc909538a51cd0/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_mul_op.cc#L287-L290) assumes that the 4 arguments are always valid scalars and tries to access the numeric value directly:

```
const float min_x = context->input(2).flat<float>()(0);
const float max_x = context->input(3).flat<float>()(0);
const float min_y = context->input(4).flat<float>()(0);
const float max_y = context->input(5).flat<float>()(0);
```

However, if any of these tensors is empty, then `.flat<T>()` is an empty buffer and accessing the element at position 0 results in overflow.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [efea03b38fb8d3b81762237dc85e579cc5fc6e87](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/efea03b38fb8d3b81762237dc85e579cc5fc6e87).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.
