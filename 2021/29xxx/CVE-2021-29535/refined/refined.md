Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29535:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a heap buffer overflow in the `QuantizedMul` operation within TensorFlow. The code directly accesses the first element of tensors representing quantization thresholds (min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y) without validating if these tensors are non-empty scalars, leading to an out-of-bounds read when an empty tensor is provided.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is an attempt to access memory outside the bounds of an allocated buffer when calling `.flat<float>()(0)` on empty tensors.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code fails to validate if the provided min/max threshold tensors are non-empty scalars before dereferencing them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow which could lead to:
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The overflow could crash the TensorFlow process.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated, heap overflows can, in some circumstances, be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by supplying an empty tensor as input for the `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, or `max_y` parameters of the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedMul` operation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the inputs to the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedMul` operation. This means they either need to be able to directly craft the TensorFlow graph or provide the input data in an environment where they can influence the operations being performed.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided code example demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability.
- The fix involves checking if the input tensors for quantization thresholds are valid scalars using `TensorShapeUtils::IsScalar()` before accessing their values.
- The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0. Patches have been backported to versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
- The vulnerability was reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.
- The severity of this vulnerability is rated as low.

**Summary**
The vulnerability occurs because the implementation of `QuantizedMul` did not validate the shape of the input tensors representing quantization thresholds, resulting in a heap buffer overflow if these tensors were empty. An attacker capable of providing inputs to the `QuantizedMul` operation could trigger a crash or potentially more severe consequences.
