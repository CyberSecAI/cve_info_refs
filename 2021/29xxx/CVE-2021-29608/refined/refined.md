The provided content is related to CVE-2021-29608.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of input validation in the `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToTensor` operation. Specifically, the implementation checks if at least one of the input tensors is not empty, but fails to validate other input tensors. This oversight leads to undefined behavior (heap out-of-bounds read or write) when the input tensors are empty.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Heap out-of-bounds (OOB) read/write:** When input tensors are empty, the lack of proper validation in `RaggedTensorToTensor` can lead to heap out-of-bounds read/write operations.
- **Null pointer dereference:** The vulnerability could also lead to a null pointer dereference under specific conditions involving empty input tensors.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploiting this vulnerability can result in a crash or unexpected behavior in the TensorFlow application.
- An attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code by gaining control of the application using the out of bounds write.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious TensorFlow graph using `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToTensor` with specifically crafted empty input tensors.
- When the malicious graph is executed, the vulnerable code is triggered, leading to a heap out-of-bounds read or write or a null pointer dereference.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply or control the input data or models to the TensorFlow application. This can involve directly feeding in tensors or providing a model with crafted tensors.
- The attacker must also have the ability to execute the malicious graph on the vulnerable system/application.

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0.
- Patches have been provided in versions 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
- The fix involves adding input validations to check for empty tensors and prevent out-of-bounds access.
- The vulnerability was reported by Yakun Zhang and Ying Wang of Baidu X-Team.
- The GitHub commits referenced in the content detail the changes made to fix the vulnerability, which include adding checks for empty input tensors to prevent out-of-bounds access, and adding checks to validate the size of row split tensors and value row IDs, preventing potential out-of-bounds reads.
