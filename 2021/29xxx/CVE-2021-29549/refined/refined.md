Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedAdd` operation within TensorFlow. Specifically, the `VectorTensorAddition` function performs a modulo operation (`i % vector_num_elements`) where `vector_num_elements` can be zero, leading to a division by zero error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Division by Zero:** The core vulnerability is the lack of validation to ensure that `vector_num_elements` is not zero before performing the modulo operation.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code determines `vector_num_elements` based on input shapes without explicitly checking for a zero value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker can trigger a runtime division by zero error, causing the TensorFlow process to crash, effectively leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Input Shapes:** By providing specific input tensors with shapes that result in `vector_num_elements` being zero, an attacker can trigger the division by zero error.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide inputs to the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedAdd` operation within a TensorFlow environment. This could be achieved by:
    - Directly crafting a TensorFlow graph with malicious inputs.
    - Providing malicious inputs to an application that uses TensorFlow.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.5.0.
- The issue was patched in commit [744009c9e5cc5d0447f0dc39d055f917e1fd9e16](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/744009c9e5cc5d0447f0dc39d055f917e1fd9e16) by adding a check to ensure `vector_num_elements > 0`.
- The fix was cherry-picked into older supported versions of TensorFlow: 2.4.2, 2.3.3, 2.2.3, and 2.1.4.
