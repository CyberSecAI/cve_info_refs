Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29511:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory over-allocation issue in the `evm_core::Memory::copy_large` function within the `evm` crate.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The code allocates memory even when it is not needed, leading to a memory over-allocation vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to perform a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves executing specific EVM opcodes related to memory operations that utilize the vulnerable `evm_core::Memory::copy_large` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers need the ability to execute EVM opcodes that trigger the vulnerable `copy_large` function. This likely requires the ability to deploy and interact with smart contracts on an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was corrected in commit `19ade85`.
- Affected versions are `<=0.21.0, ==0.22.0, ==0.23.0, ==0.24.0, ==0.25.0, ==0.26.0`
- Patched versions are `==0.21.1, ==0.23.1, ==0.24.1, ==0.25.1, >=0.26.1`
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2021-29511 and GHSA ID GHSA-4jwq-572w-4388.
- The advisory states that there are no workarounds other than upgrading the `evm` crate.
