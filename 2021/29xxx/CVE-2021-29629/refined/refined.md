    "summary": "The provided documents from NetApp and FreeBSD relate to CVE-2021-29629, which is a vulnerability in the libradius library used in FreeBSD. The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper message validation, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. NetApp confirms that Clustered Data ONTAP incorporates FreeBSD and is therefore susceptible to the vulnerability.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to missing message validation in the `libradius` library, specifically in the `rad_get_attr(3)` function which fails to verify the attribute length before processing it, leading to a potentially bogus length and in the `is_valid_response()` function that can enter an infinite loop.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper validation of attribute length in `rad_get_attr(3)` before subtracting the length of type and length fields which can result in a bogus length for the Value field.",
         "Lack of verification of non-zero attribute length in `is_valid_response()` resulting in a potential infinite loop."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The `rad_get_attr(3)` bug could cause applications to crash or enter an infinite loop when processing untrusted RADIUS messages.",
      "attack_vectors": "A malicious RADIUS client can send specially crafted messages to a server using `libradius(3)`, triggering the vulnerability. Similarly, a compromised RADIUS server can trigger a vulnerability in a client.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be capable of sending malicious RADIUS messages to a vulnerable server or client. No special privileges or position is required beyond being able to send messages.",
      "additional_information": "NetApp confirms that Clustered Data ONTAP incorporates FreeBSD and is therefore susceptible to the vulnerability, however, they state that none of their products are affected by this vulnerability, this is likely because of the way they are using the libradius library, or lack of use. The FreeBSD advisory notes that all supported versions of FreeBSD are affected."
