**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities is high. Successful exploitation could lead to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is not specified in detail, but it involves triggering the identified memory safety bugs during browser or email client operation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to trigger the memory safety bugs. This can happen through the regular usage of the browser or email client or by visiting a malicious webpage. It's implied that the attacker needs to find a way to interact with the vulnerable code paths within the affected applications.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that while these issues cannot be exploited through email in Thunderbird due to scripting being disabled when reading mail, it is still a risk in browser-like contexts.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 91, Firefox ESR 78.13, and Thunderbird 78.13.
