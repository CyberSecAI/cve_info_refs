Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-29558

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a heap-based buffer overflow in the `tf.raw_ops.SparseSplit` operation within the TensorFlow library. Specifically, the `SparseTensor::Split` function calculates an index (`slice_index`) based on user-provided input without proper bounds checking, which is then used to access the `num_values` array, leading to out-of-bounds writes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap buffer overflow:** The core issue is writing past the allocated boundary of the `num_values` array.
- **Missing Bounds Check:** The `slice_index` is calculated using user-controlled input (`dim`), `split_size` and `residual` parameters, which are not validated before accessing the array.
- **User-controlled offset:** The `split_dim` is user-controlled, used in calculating the offset into the `input_tensor.indices` which contributes to the vulnerable `slice_index`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Heap corruption:** Overwriting data on the heap can lead to unpredictable behavior, including crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting specific inputs to the `tf.raw_ops.SparseSplit` operation, specifically, by controlling `split_dim`, `indices`, `shape`, and `num_split` inputs, which influence `slice_index` calculation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to construct and execute TensorFlow graphs that include the vulnerable `tf.raw_ops.SparseSplit` operation with malicious parameters.
- The attacker doesn't need a privileged position on the system; however, they need control over the inputs to the `SparseSplit` function.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix for this issue is present in the commit [8ba6fa29cd8bf9cef9b718dc31c78c73081f5b31](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8ba6fa29cd8bf9cef9b718dc31c78c73081f5b31).
- The fix involves adding validation to ensure that `slice_index` is within the valid bounds of the `num_values` array.
- The vulnerability is considered to be Low severity.
- Affected versions are TensorFlow versions less than 2.5.0.
- Patched versions include 2.1.4, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, and 2.4.2.
