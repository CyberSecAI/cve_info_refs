Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29487:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how October CMS handles user authentication via "persist" cookies. Specifically, the system's permission checking logic was susceptible to type juggling issues, where string values were not being strictly compared as integers. This allowed an attacker, with knowledge of Laravel's secret key, to craft a malicious persist cookie.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Type Juggling:** The code used loose comparison operators (`==`) instead of strict comparison operators (`===`) when checking permission values, leading to type juggling issues where string values could be interpreted as integers.
- **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The system's logic for checking permissions based on a "persist" cookie allowed for crafting of malicious cookies if the Laravel secret key was known.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker could bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to user accounts without knowing the user's actual credentials.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By gaining access to another user's account, the attacker could potentially escalate privileges depending on the targeted user's roles and permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Cookie Creation:** The primary attack vector is the crafting of a malicious "persist" cookie. This required the attacker to:
  1. Obtain Laravel's secret key used for cookie encryption.
  2. Know the user ID they are targeting and the nature of permissions to spoof.
  3. Craft a cookie with manipulated permissions.
- **Cookie Injection:** Once the crafted cookie exists, the attacker would need to inject or use the malicious cookie in a request to the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Laravel's secret key:** This key is necessary to create a valid cookie and required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Target User ID:** The attacker needs to know the user ID of the target they want to impersonate.
- **User Logged in:** The targeted user must be logged in while the attacker is exploiting the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was patched in October CMS builds 472 and v1.1.5.
- Patches are available at `octobercms/library@016a297` and `octobercms/library@5bd1a28`.
- The vulnerability is not logged in access logs when exploited via the "persist" cookie.

The provided commit diffs show how the vulnerability was addressed by converting the loose comparison operators (`==`) to strict comparison operators (`===`) and by explicitly casting the values to integers using `(int)`. This ensures that comparisons are performed on the correct data types.
