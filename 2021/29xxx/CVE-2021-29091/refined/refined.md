Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29091:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, also known as a Path Traversal vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal: The vulnerability exists in the file management component of Synology Photo Station. It allows an attacker to manipulate the path used to access files, potentially escaping the intended directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact is the ability for remote authenticated users to write arbitrary files on the system. This can lead to various consequences like:
    - Overwriting configuration files.
    - Uploading malicious code to be executed.
    - Data exfiltration.
    - Denial of Service.
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- The attack is carried out by sending manipulated requests to the vulnerable Photo Station application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a remote authenticated user.
- Low privileges are sufficient, as indicated by "PR:L" in the CVSS vector.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Synology Photo Station versions before 6.8.14-3500.
- The specific vectors used for exploitation are not specified in this advisory.
- This vulnerability can lead to an integrity compromise (I:H) with no confidentiality (C:N) or availability (A:N) impact as indicated in the CVSS vector. The scope is changed (S:C) which means that this could also impact other components that rely on the modified files.
