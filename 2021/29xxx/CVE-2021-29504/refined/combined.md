### @schlessera **[schlessera](/schlessera)** commented [May 10, 2021](#issue-884329407)

The PR [wp-cli/wp-cli#5523](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/5523) changes the default behavior for `Utils\http_request()` so that it does not automatically retry a remote request that failed its TLS handshake by skipping certificate validation.

This PR adds the `--insecure` flag to the following commands to explicitly switch back to the previous behavior:

* `core verify-checksums`
* `pluginverify-checksums`

Sorry, something went wrong.

### @schlessera **[schlessera](/schlessera)** commented [May 10, 2021](#issue-884370725)

The PR [wp-cli/wp-cli#5523](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/5523) changes the default behavior for `Utils\http_request()` so that it does not automatically retry a remote request that failed its TLS handshake by skipping certificate validation.

This PR adds the `--insecure` flag to the following commands to explicitly switch back to the previous behavior:

* `package install`

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Improper Certificate Validation in WP-CLI framework

High

[schlessera](/schlessera)
published
GHSA-rwgm-f83r-v3qj
May 19, 2021

## Package

composer

wp-cli/wp-cli
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

< 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.5.0

## Description

### Impact

An improper error handling in HTTPS requests management in WP-CLI version 0.12.0 and later allows remote attackers able to intercept the communication to remotely disable the certificate verification on WP-CLI side, gaining full control over the communication content, including the ability to impersonate update servers and push malicious updates towards WordPress instances controlled by the vulnerable WP-CLI agent, or push malicious updates toward WP-CLI itself.

### Patches

The vulnerability stems from the fact that the default behavior of `WP_CLI\Utils\http_request()` when encountering a TLS handshake error is to disable certificate validation and retry the same request.

The default behavior has been changed with version 2.5.0 of WP-CLI and the `wp-cli/wp-cli` framework (via [#5523](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/5523)) so that the `WP_CLI\Utils\http_request()` method accepts an `$insecure` option that is `false` by default and consequently that a TLS handshake failure is a hard error by default. This new default is a breaking change and ripples through to all consumers of `WP_CLI\Utils\http_request()`, including those in separate WP-CLI bundled or third-party packages.

[#5523](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/5523) has also added an `--insecure` flag to the `cli update` command to counter this breaking change.

Subsequent PRs on the command repositories have added an `--insecure` flag to the appropriate commands on the following repositories to counter the breaking change:

* [wp-cli/config-command#128](https://github.com/wp-cli/config-command/pull/128)
* [wp-cli/core-command#186](https://github.com/wp-cli/core-command/pull/186)
* [wp-cli/extension-command#287](https://github.com/wp-cli/extension-command/pull/287)
* [wp-cli/checksum-command#86](https://github.com/wp-cli/checksum-command/pull/86)
* [wp-cli/package-command#138](https://github.com/wp-cli/package-command/pull/138)

### Workarounds

There is no direct workaround for the default insecure behavior of `wp-cli/wp-cli` versions before 2.5.0.

The workaround for dealing with the breaking change in the commands directly affected by the new secure default behavior is to add the `--insecure` flag to manually opt-in to the previous insecure behavior.

### @schlessera **[schlessera](/schlessera)** commented [May 7, 2021](#issue-879176142)

The PR [wp-cli/wp-cli#5523](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/5523) changes the default behavior for `Utils\http_request()` so that it does not automatically retry a remote request that failed its TLS handshake by skipping certificate validation.

This PR adds the `--insecure` flag to the following commands to explicitly switch back to the previous behavior:

* `plugin install`
* `plugin update`
* `theme install`
* `theme update`

Sorry, something went wrong.

### @schlessera **[schlessera](/schlessera)** commented [May 7, 2021](#issue-879075829)

The PR [wp-cli/wp-cli#5523](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/5523) changes the default behavior for `Utils\http_request()` so that it does not automatically retry a remote request that failed its TLS handshake by skipping certificate validation.

This PR adds the `--insecure` flag to the following commands to explicitly switch back to the previous behavior:

* `core download`
* `core update`

Sorry, something went wrong.

### @schlessera **[schlessera](/schlessera)** commented [May 6, 2021](#issue-877479198) • edited Loading

This PR disables the automatic retrying of `Utils/http_request()` that was skipping certificate validation.

The new default is to produce a hard error on certificate errors.

This PR also adds a new `--insecure` flag to the `cli update` command that turns this retrying back on when explicitly requested, which allows manually going back to the previous behavior.

Subsequent PRs on the command repositories will add a similar `--insecure` flag to the appropriate commands on the following repositories:

* [`wp-cli/config-command`](https://github.com/wp-cli/config-command) => [Add `--insecure` flag to `config create` & `config shuffle-salts` commands config-command#128](https://github.com/wp-cli/config-command/pull/128)
* [`wp-cli/core-command`](https://github.com/wp-cli/core-command) => [Add `--insecure` flag to `core download` & `core update` commands core-command#186](https://github.com/wp-cli/core-command/pull/186)
* [`wp-cli/extension-command`](https://github.com/wp-cli/extension-command) => [Add `--insecure` flag to `plugin|theme install` & `plugin\theme update` commands extension-command#287](https://github.com/wp-cli/extension-command/pull/287)
* [`wp-cli/checksum-command`](https://github.com/wp-cli/checksum-command) => [Add `--insecure` flag to `core|plugin verify-checksums` commands checksum-command#86](https://github.com/wp-cli/checksum-command/pull/86)
* [`wp-cli/package-command`](https://github.com/wp-cli/package-command) => [Add `--insecure` flag to `package install` command package-command#138](https://github.com/wp-cli/package-command/pull/138)
