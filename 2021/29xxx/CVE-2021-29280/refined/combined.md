An upgraded-ARP-Poisoning attack can be directed at “cheating” a host computer or a network router. If a router has the wrong MAC address for a given IP address, then all communications are routed to the wrong host.

### After running this tool, wait for 1-2 minutes then automatically your Internet will be disconnected !!

### All connected devices also can't connect to the internet.

## What is ARP-Poisoning?

* ARP Poisoning (also known as ARP Spoofing) is a type of cyber attack carried out over a Local Area Network (LAN) that involves sending malicious ARP packets to a default gateway on a LAN in order to change the pairings in its IP to MAC address table. ARP Protocol translates IP addresses into MAC addresses. Because the ARP protocol was designed purely for efficiency and not for security, ARP Poisoning attacks are extremely easy to carry out as long as the attacker has control of a machine within the target LAN or is directly connected to it.
* The attack itself consists of an attacker sending a false ARP reply message to the default network gateway, informing it that his or her MAC address should be associated with his or her target's IP address (and vice-versa, so his or her target's MAC is now associated with the attacker's IP address). Once the default gateway has received this message and broadcasts its changes to all other devices on the network, all of the target's traffic to any other device on the network travels through the attacker's computer, allowing the attacker to inspect or modify it before forwarding it to its real destination. Because ARP Poisoning attacks occur on such a low level, users targeted by ARP Poisoning rarely realize that their traffic is being inspected or modified. Besides Man-in-the-Middle Attacks, ARP Poisoning can be used to cause a denial-of-service condition over a LAN by simply intercepting or dropping and not forwarding the target's packets.

* This powerful Python script harnesses the strength of SYN packets to generate a flood of network activity. 🌩️⚡
* With the help of the Scapy library, this code allows you to initiate a high-intensity flood by simulating the initiation of TCP connections. 💥💣
* The SYN Flooder offers a straightforward interface, allowing you to specify the target host or IP address. Once launched, the script deploys multiple threads 🧵 to enhance the flooding effect, overwhelming the target with a surge of connection requests. 🌊🌪️

Please exercise caution and use this tool responsibly. SYN flooding is an aggressive network testing technique that should only be employed in controlled environments with proper authorization. ⚠️🔒

We encourage you to explore this repository, learn about network security, and contribute to its development. Together, let's build a safer and more resilient cyberspace. 💪🌟

## Note: It's crucial to respect legal and ethical boundaries while using this code.

🎯 **An upgraded-ARP-Poisoning attack can be directed at “cheating” a host computer or a network router. If a router has the wrong MAC address for a given IP address, then all communications are routed to the wrong host.**

# ☠️ What is ARP-Poisoning?

* ARP Poisoning (also known as ARP Spoofing) is a type of cyber attack carried out over a Local Area Network (LAN) that involves sending malicious ARP packets to a default gateway on a LAN in order to change the pairings in its IP to MAC address table. ARP Protocol translates IP addresses into MAC addresses.

Once the default gateway has received this message and broadcasts its changes to all other devices on the network, all of the target’s traffic to any other device on the network travels through the attacker’s computer, allowing the attacker to inspect or modify it before forwarding it to its real destination. Because ARP Poisoning attacks occur on such a low level, users targeted by ARP Poisoning rarely realize that their traffic is being inspected or modified. Besides Man-in-the-Middle Attacks, ARP Poisoning can be used to cause a denial-of-service condition over a LAN by simply intercepting or dropping and not forwarding the target’s packets.

💥 **Here is how ARP works** 💥

* When one machine needs to communicate with another, it looks up its ARP table.
* If the MAC address is not found in the table, the **ARP\_request** is broadcasted over the network.
* All machines on the network will compare this IP address to MAC address.
* If one of the machines in the network identifies this address, then it will respond to the **ARP\_request** with its IP and MAC address.
* The requesting computer will store the address pair in its ARP table and communication will take place.

From the press

The years go by, and I keep trying one Linux desktop distro after the other. But for more than a decade now, I come back to Linux Mint. Why? It's simple: Year in and year out, Mint remains the best, easiest-to-use Linux desktop.

###### Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols

###### ZDNet

Mint has become the very best example of what a Linux desktop should be: fast, easy, pleasing to the eye, useful and productive. Others, still, see Mint as the ideal desktop for Windows refugees, or those who are trying out Linux for the first time, and want an operating system that essentially works 'out of the box'.

###### David Hayward

###### Linux Format

Linux Mint's latest release will have an exceptionally wide appeal. Anyone looking for an incredibly stable, robust, fast, clean, and user-friendly desktop operating system could do a whole lot worse. [...] Every Linux desktop distribution should strive to do exactly what Linux Mint 20.1 has accomplished--create a desktop that is the perfect balance of speed, features, and user-friendliness.

###### Jack Wallen

###### TechRepublic

There's a good reason for that popularity: Linux Mint just works. It isn't "changing the desktop computer paradigm," or "innovating" in "groundbreaking" ways. The team behind Mint is just building a desktop operating system that looks and functions a lot like every other desktop operating system you've used, which is to say you'll be immediately comfortable and stop thinking about your desktop and start using it to do actual work.

###### Scott Gilbertson

###### ars technica

Exploring the bevy of Linux distributions out there is a fun part of the hobby, but for your first installation, you will likely want something popular and beginner-friendly, so it's easy to get help when you need it. That's why I recommend starting with Linux Mint.

###### Whitson Gordon

###### PCMag

Linux Mint has again shown why it deserves to stay among the best Linux distribution for beginners. If you’re thinking to migrate from Windows to Linux, you should definitely get your hand on Linux Mint.
