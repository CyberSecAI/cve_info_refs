Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-29473:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the `Exiv2::Jp2Image::doWriteMetadata` function. This occurs when Exiv2 attempts to write metadata into a crafted image file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Out-of-bounds read: The software reads data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Denial of service: An attacker could trigger the vulnerability by providing a crafted image file to Exiv2, causing the application to crash. This can lead to a denial of service condition.

**Attack vectors:**

- The primary attack vector is through a crafted image file.
- An attacker needs to trick a victim into using Exiv2 to write metadata to a malicious image file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious image file that will trigger the out-of-bounds read during metadata writing.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to run the Exiv2 tool with the crafted image and the appropriate command line arguments, for instance `insert` to write the metadata.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when writing metadata, which is a less frequent Exiv2 operation than reading metadata.
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 0.27.4 of Exiv2.
- The vulnerability is rated as "low" severity.
- The affected versions are prior to v0.27.4
- The fix is available in v0.27.4 and later
