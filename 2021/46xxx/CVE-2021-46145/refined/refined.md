{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Honda-Civic keyfob system's counter resynchronization mechanism can be manipulated by replaying previously eavesdropped lock/unlock commands in a specific sequence.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Vulnerable rolling code implementation",
      "Lack of proper counter synchronization checks",
      "Acceptance of a sliding window of codes which can be abused"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can replay previously intercepted lock/unlock commands to gain unauthorized access to the vehicle.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Eavesdropping on wireless communication between keyfob and car",
       "Replaying captured commands in a specific sequence to resynchronize the rolling code counter"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be in proximity to eavesdrop wireless communication and needs to be able to replay radio signals."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was successfully tested on a Honda Civic 2012. The extent to which other vehicles are affected is unknown."
