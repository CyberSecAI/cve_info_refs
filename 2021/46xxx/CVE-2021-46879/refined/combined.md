Signed-off-by: davkor david@adalogics.com

This solves an issue in parsing an msgpack-c object related to gelf data. The main problem is that a wrong variable is used to get the msgpack data, and this results in various bugs, amongst other things a heap overflow in `flb_msgpack_gelf_value_ext` (OSS-Fuzz issue 5076752961110016)

[@edsiper](https://github.com/edsiper) please verify this one, i.e. that we need to use `v` instead of `o`. `v` is the variable used all other places for getting the `val` and `val_len` variables.
