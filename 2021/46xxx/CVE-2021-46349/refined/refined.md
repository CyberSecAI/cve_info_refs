The content is related to CVE-2021-46349.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an assertion failure in `ecma_object_get_class_name` function due to missing object types in the type check. The code expected the object type to be either `ECMA_OBJECT_TYPE_GENERAL` or `ECMA_OBJECT_TYPE_PROXY`, but it encountered an object of a different type during the execution of the provided JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect type checking in the `ecma_object_get_class_name` function.
- Missing handling for certain object types, leading to an assertion failure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program termination due to the failed assertion.
- Denial of service, as the program aborts unexpectedly.

**Attack vectors:**
- Execution of a specially crafted JavaScript code that creates objects of a type that was not handled by the `ecma_object_get_class_name` function.
- This was triggered through the execution of a `class` expression as part of an assignment inside of a `for` loop.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute JavaScript code within the vulnerable JerryScript environment.
- The attacker can be a local user or a remote user able to send JavaScript code to be interpreted by the vulnerable application.
