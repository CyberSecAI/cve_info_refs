Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46562:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered by parsing of maliciously crafted JT files within Bentley MicroStation and MicroStation-based applications. Specifically, the issue lies in a read operation that goes beyond the bounds of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** A crafted JT file can cause the application to read data beyond the allocated memory buffer.
*   **Use-after-free:** There are also user-after-free vulnerabilities present, as mentioned in the Bentley advisory, although the specific details for CVE-2021-46562 are not detailed as this CVE is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process. This allows an attacker to gain control over the system.
*   **High Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The CVSS score of 7.8 indicates a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious JT Files:** The primary attack vector involves opening a specially crafted JT file with a vulnerable version of the software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local Access**: The attacker needs to have a malicious file that the victim can open on their local computer.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must open a malicious JT file for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
*   Bentley has released updates to address these vulnerabilities.
*   The Bentley advisory (BE-2021-0005) groups multiple CVEs together, all stemming from similar out-of-bounds and use-after-free vulnerabilities related to JT file parsing in MicroStation and its related applications.
* The specific vulnerability (ZDI-CAN-14987) associated with this CVE was discovered by xina1i.

**Affected products:** MicroStation CONNECT and Bentley View.

**Mitigation:** Update to MicroStation and Bentley View version 10.16.02.* or later
