The provided content relates to a bug in JerryScript, identified as issue #4921 and fixed by pull request #4947, which is related to the assertion failure `context_p->token.type == LEXER_LITERAL` in `jerryscript/jerry-core/parser/js/js-parser-expr.c` at line 531 within the `parser_check_duplicated_private_field` function.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

*   **Root cause:** The issue arises due to a bug in the parser when handling duplicated private fields within a class definition. Specifically, the parser expects the token type to be `LEXER_LITERAL`, but in certain circumstances it is not.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present**: The core vulnerability is an assertion failure. While this might not directly lead to arbitrary code execution, it indicates a flaw in how the parser handles private fields. It leads to the program aborting due to the failed assertion.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: The immediate impact is a denial of service. The program aborts and exits, thus crashing the JerryScript engine. It's also possible this could be a symptom of a more serious vulnerability that could potentially be exploited.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is via a malformed JavaScript code containing a class definition with duplicated private fields, specifically within an async method's parameter list using a default value (`#async bar(x = 1)`).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to provide the malformed JavaScript code to the JerryScript engine.
