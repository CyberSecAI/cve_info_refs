  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to invalid free operations within the `uriNormalizeSyntax` function of the uriparser library.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Double-free"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a crash due to a segmentation fault, potentially resulting in a denial of service. In some cases, it could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when processing URIs containing empty segments. An attacker could craft a malicious URI with empty segments to trigger the vulnerable code path.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted URI to a vulnerable application that uses the uriparser library."
