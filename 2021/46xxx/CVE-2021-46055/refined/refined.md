The provided content relates to a crash in the `wasm::Builder::makeFunction` function within the WebAssembly Binaryen project, triggered by a malformed WebAssembly file. The issue was reported on GitHub and resulted in a fix that adds a check for invalid function types.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A malformed WebAssembly file (`POC8.zip`) caused an assertion failure within the `wasm::Builder::makeFunction` function. Specifically the assertion `type.isSignature()` failed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper validation or sanitization of input WebAssembly binary data. This allowed a malformed file to reach a point where the code makes assumptions that lead to assertion failures. The specific issue was a missing check for function types in imported functions

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact is a denial-of-service via an abort, which can be triggered when processing the malformed WebAssembly file with `wasm-dis` tool of Binaryen.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is providing a specially crafted malicious WebAssembly file to the `wasm-dis` tool of Binaryen.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malformed wasm file to be processed by `wasm-dis`.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is located in `/home/zxq/CVE_testing/project/binaryen/src/wasm-builder.h:49` which can be considered as the source file.
- The fix involves adding a format check to validate imported function types before they are used by the builder function. This check prevents the assertion failure.
- The vulnerability is located in `wasm::WasmBinaryBuilder::readImports` function in `wasm/wasm-binary.cpp` file, and the fix is located in the same file.
- The fix was implemented in commit `1beec37` and introduced in PR `4423`.
