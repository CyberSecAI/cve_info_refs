{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application did not properly blacklist scriptable file types during file upload.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient file type validation",
      "Missing file type blacklist",
      "Potential XSS vulnerabilities due to upload of scriptable files"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could upload malicious files (e.g., .html, .js) containing XSS exploits, which would execute when victims accessed links to these files, potentially leading to information disclosure, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "File upload functionality.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to use the file upload functionality within the application."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The fix consists of adding common scriptable file types to the file type blacklist configuration. The advisory explicitly mentions that users should adapt the blacklist setting to their needs, not blacklisting file types that are required for upload and suggesting the use of approval workflows for sensitive file types.",
