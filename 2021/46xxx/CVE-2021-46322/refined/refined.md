Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46322:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Duktape, the embeddable Javascript engine, handles the creation of environment records and 'arguments' objects during function calls, specifically when the value stack is close to its limit. When an 'arguments' object exists, the necessary environment record and "varmap" are set up before the actual call. This "varmap" references register numbers that might not exist yet. If the value stack needs to grow and fails due to reaching its limit, the "varmap" will reference invalid value stack offsets during the partial activation unwind, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack exhaustion:** The vulnerability is triggered when a function call, particularly one with an arguments object, attempts to grow the value stack beyond its limit.
- **Incorrect environment setup:**  The "varmap" setup is done before the value stack growth check, leading to references to invalid offsets on stack unwind if the growth fails.
- **SEGV:** The result is a segmentation fault (SEGV) due to a memory access violation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A specially crafted JavaScript file or code can cause a segmentation fault, leading to the termination of the application using the Duktape engine. This constitutes a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted JavaScript:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specific structure in Javascript code that leads to excessive stack usage and triggers the problematic code path in Duktape.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to execute JavaScript:** An attacker must be able to execute a crafted piece of JavaScript code within an environment using the vulnerable Duktape engine. This could be through a web application, embedded system, or any other context where Duktape is used.

**More Details than the CVE:**
- The provided content goes into more detail than the CVE description. The github issue #2448 describes the issue, its root cause, and even includes a proof of concept (PoC) javascript code to reproduce the crash. It also shows a stack trace where the crash occurs in `duk_push_tval` inside `duk_api_stack.c`.
- The fix involves growing the value stack before setting up the environment record, as shown in the commit `fc75060`.
- The issue is triggered when a function with an arguments object is called recursively, reaching the stack limit during the creation of arguments object for that function.
