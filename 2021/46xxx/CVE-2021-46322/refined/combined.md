# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| So this apparently happens when the infinite test() recursion reaches the maximum value stack size, and on that unwind path closing scopes doesn't work as expected. Should be relatively straightforward to figure out. |

| Renaming the `var arguments = test()` to say `var my_arguments = test()` avoids the issue. On the other hand if one does that and adds a `void arguments;` statement, which triggers creation of an arguments object but no operations on it, again triggers the issue. So it seems that it's important that the target function has an arguments object flag. |

### **[svaarala](/svaarala)** commented [Jan 11, 2022](#issuecomment-1009475853)

| I think I found the root cause: when `arguments` exists call handling sets up the necessary environment record and "varmap" before the call (normally it is delayed if/until needed). That "varmap" will reference register numbers that don't yet exist at the time that varmap setup is done. The very next step is to resize (grow) the valstack for the call - but if that fails, the "varmap" will reference out of value stack offsets when the partially complete activation is unwound.  The fix might be to grow the value stack before setting up the env record, I'm trying to see if that works in a straightforward manner without other issues. |

| The CVE says that this affects version 2.99.99. Given that there is no such version tagged is it reasonable to assume that this affects all released versions? |
