Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46046:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an untrusted pointer dereference in the `gf_isom_box_size` function. Specifically, the code attempts to access memory at the address `rdi + 0x10`, where the value in register `rdi` is not validated and potentially points to an invalid memory location.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Untrusted Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is the dereference of a pointer (`rdi`) without proper validation, which leads to a segmentation fault when an invalid address is accessed.
- The code attempts to read a value at offset 0x10 of the pointer `rdi` and if that read value is valid, it further attempts to read a value at offset 0x58 of the read value. This chain of dereferences, without validation, allows an attacker to control the memory regions being accessed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a segmentation fault, which causes the application (`MP4Box`) to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not directly demonstrated in the provided information, an untrusted pointer dereference vulnerability can potentially be exploited further to achieve arbitrary code execution if the attacker can carefully craft the input to control the memory regions being accessed, though this is not explicitly described in the provided information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted Input File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted input file (in this case, a file named `POC8.zip` containing an MP4 file). The specific crafted file is needed to trigger the invalid pointer dereference within the `gf_isom_box_size` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify a specially crafted MP4 file.
- **Execution of Vulnerable Software:** The attacker must get the vulnerable `MP4Box` application to process this malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided backtrace indicates the crash occurs at `gf_isom_box_size+10`, specifically at the instruction `mov rax, qword ptr [rdi + 0x10]`, which is where the invalid memory access happens.
- The vulnerability was fixed in the context of issue [#1999](https://github.com/gpac/gpac/issues/1999)
- The debian advisory indicates that the issue was fixed in version 1.0.1+dfsg1-4+deb11u2.
