# GoAnywhere MFT Security Advisory

### Path Traversal: CVE-2021-46830

Text

A security vulnerability has been identified within GoAnywhere MFT. This vulnerability could potentially allow an external user who self-registers with a specific username and/or profile information to gain access to files at a higher directory level than intended. There are no known active exploits and the circumstances to permit this unintended access are remote, however, out of an abundance of caution, we are providing this advisory.

*Affected Versions: < 6.8.3*

This issue was reported to the GoAnywhere Security team by Gert Keldermans of NTT Belgium.

### Remediation

Text

Upgrade to GoAnywhere MFT 6.8.3 or higher to fully remediate this vulnerability.

* This patch version prevents the creation and authentication of any Web Users with invalid or suspicious configurations. ***Be sure to download the upgrader, not the installer.***
* Review and disable any Web User accounts that contain invalid or suspicious configuration

###

### Mitigation Options

For those unable to upgrade at this time, the following mitigation options are available:

Option 1 – Disable Self-Registration

* Disable Self-Registration for external users. The Self-Registration settings can be found under Users -> Web User Self-Registration.
* Review and disable any Web User accounts that contain invalid or suspicious configurations.

Option 2 – Configuration Review and Updates

* Update any Web User Templates used in Self-Registration to not use dynamic variables in folder paths.
* Ensure the Minimum User Name Length in the User Name Policy for Web Users under the Web User Settings (Users -> Web User Settings -> User Name Policy) is configured to require 3 or more characters.
* Ensure the Prohibited Special Characters on the User Name Policy for Web Users prohibits path traversing characters such as / and \.
* Review and disable any Web User accounts that contain invalid or suspicious configurations.

### May 14, 2018

##### Version 5.7.0

#### Cloud Connectors

Cloud Connectors allow GoAnywhere to easily integrate with popular SOAP and RESTful web service applications including Salesforce, Box, Dropbox, Microsoft Dynamics CRM, and more. The Cloud Connection definition contains all the actions and parameters required to communicate with the API. When a Cloud Connector is installed, their Actions appear as Tasks under the Cloud Connector category in the Component Library section of the Project Designer. GoAnywhere supports any number of Cloud Connectors at a time, allowing for automated processes between multiple APIs. Cloud Connectors can be downloaded from the GoAnywhere Cloud Connector Marketplace where new service definitions are added frequently.

The following Cloud Connectors are available from the Marketplace:

* **Box.com** - Transfer and manage files between GoAnywhere and Box with this file system connector.
* **Dropbox** - Transfer and manage files between GoAnywhere and Dropbox with this file system connector.
* **GoAnywhere Command** - Allows you to submit all GoAnywhere Command actions such as adding web users, submitting projects, etc using this connector.
* **Microsoft Dynamics CRM** - Connect to your online Dynamics 365 instance to work with Accounts, Contacts, Cases, and more with this connector.
* **Microsoft SharePoint Online** - Upload, download, and work with your documents on SharePoint Online (cloud edition).
* **Salesforce** - Automate account creation, manage contacts, and perform other CRM functions with this Salesforce Cloud Connector.

#### Other Cloud Connector Enhancements

* Added a new For-Each File Part Loop that can be used in Cloud Connectors to process a file in chunks. For example, uploading files greater than 150 MB to Dropbox requires the file to be split into chunks and uploaded in smaller pieces using multiple REST Post requests.
* Added a new Cloud Connector task that allows users to configure input and output dynamically based on the actions defined in the Cloud Connector definition.
* Added a new Cloud Connector Designer which allows users with the Product Administrator role to create service definitions. The configuration is similar to the Project Designer where you can add REST/SOAP web service tasks, parse JSON/XML responses, validate information, and more.
* Added admin logging and revision history to Cloud Connector definitions along with the ability to restore previous versions.
* Added a Cloud Connectors marketplace to make it easy to download and install Cloud Connectors in your GoAnywhere MFT instance.
* Added a new Resource for Cloud Connectors to define connection information to cloud services like the user and password.
* Added six new Input Variables (Text Field, Text Area, Password, Boolean, List, and File) that can be used in the Cloud Connector Designer. The Cloud Connector Resource and Task prompt the user for information based on these input variables.
* Added an Output Variable in the Cloud Connector Designer that can be included in Actions. The new Cloud Connector Task can set variables using data that was generated or retrieved when the Cloud Connector executes. For example, a call to a Salesforce Cloud Connector to create a new account could return the Account ID that could be used in subsequent tasks.
* Added a new Cloud Connector management section under the System menu. Cloud Connectors can be created from scratch, imported, or easily installed from an online marketplace. The marketplace contains preconfigured connectors with the most popular cloud services you may need like Salesforce, Dropbox, Google Drive, and more.

#### Administration

### April 13, 2017

##### Version 5.5.0

Agents

GoAnywhere Agents provide real-time remote workflow and file transfer capabilities that are controlled from a central GoAnywhere MFT server. Agents can be deployed to virtually any operating system including Windows, Linux, IBM i and other platforms. Agents can run on systems inside an organizationâs network to move files throughout the data center. Additionally, you can deploy Agents to remote sites like branch offices, cloud environments like Amazon AWS, Azure, and other remote locations. When an Agent starts up, it will connect to GoAnywhere MFT which will then take over management of that Agent.

Agents can run multi-step workflows on the systems where they are installed. These workflows can copy files, archive files, translate data, add data to a database, execute native commands, or other file system tasks. Workflows on Agents can be scheduled to run on a recurring basis.

Agents can also monitor for new, modified, and deleted files on its file system. When a file is found, Agents can process the file locally or call a Project workflow on GoAnywhere MFT.

GoAnywhere MFT acts as the central point of control to manage all Agents which are connected to it. Admin users in GoAnywhere MFT will configure the work that should be performed on its Agents. Administrators can also view events that occurred, such as file transfers or completed jobs on those Agents.

Agents can be grouped together to simplify setup and configuration. This allows administrators to define tasks that should run on all Agents in a group. For example, an organization that has hundreds of retail stores can easily send out new files to each store in the group. Or, a group of Linux servers can be defined to execute the same SSH commands on all Agent systems at once.

Agent Features

Listed below is a summary of features in GoAnywhere Agents:

Text fields can be added to the top of the report to describe the report criteria and summary fields can be used to calculate the min, max, average, or summary values of the data. Charts can also be added to visualize the information in the report.
* Added a new Completed Jobs by Project report that lists the number of Jobs executed, the number of files transferred in those Jobs, and the bytes transferred for each Project.
* Added a new File Transfer Summary report that displays the total number of files transferred during the specified date range.
* Added a new Unresolved Jobs report that lists the total number of jobs that failed during the specified date range that have not yet been resolved.

### May 31, 2016

##### Version 5.3.0

Starting with version 5.3.0, GoAnywhere MFT requires a minimum JRE (Java Runtime Environment) version of 1.7. If you are running on a Java version prior to 1.7, you must upgrade your JRE before upgrading GoAnywhere MFT to version 5.3.0.

Secure Forms

The new Secure Forms module allows end-users to fill out custom forms and optionally upload files through a secure HTTPS web portal in GoAnywhere MFT. The Secure Forms can then call Project workflows in GoAnywhere MFT to automatically process the submitted data and files.

GoAnywhere MFT administrators can define one or more Secure Forms with configurable input and output fields, custom labels, and file components to control the data which end-users provide when submitting a form.

For instance, a Secure Form could be used to collect electronic voting ballots, in which the user would be prompted for input parameters such as the county in which they live. The user could then upload their electronic ballot and submit the Secure Form. A Project workflow could automatically be executed to distribute this electronic ballot to the appropriate county election official (based on the county selected by the end-user on the Secure Form).

The Secure Form module includes:

* Granular access controls with support for authenticated and public sessions.
* Ability to embed forms into existing external web applications.
* Friendly URL access to forms.
* URL redirection on submit.
* Fully customizable input components and layout.
* Support for file uploads.

### February 15, 2016

##### Version 5.2.0

Domains

Domains can be used to segment a GoAnywhere installation into multiple security zones where authorized users can only work with the items and files belonging to their assigned Domains. This allows an organization to share a single installation of GoAnywhere MFT with multiple divisions or departments while maintaining separation of administrative access. Domains features include:

* Specific admin users and groups can be authorized to one or more Domains.
* Domains can be locked into specific folders on the file system. This prevents admin users from accessing files/folders outside of their assigned Domains.
* Admin users can quickly switch between their assigned Domains.
* Items can be moved between assigned Domains, such as Users, Groups, Project and Resources.

By default, each GoAnywhere installation will be provided with two Domains at no charge. Additional Domains can be purchased as needed.Contact your account manager for pricing and additional details.

GoFast File Transfer Acceleration Protocol

The GoFast file transfer acceleration protocol was added, which uses multiple UDP channels to accelerate the movement of files between servers. This feature includes a new GoFast Server module for receiving accelerated file transfers and a new GoFast Task and Resource for initiating the transfers from within your Projects. GoFast features include:

* Uses standard SSL/TLS encryption to protect the control channel between the client and server.
* Optional Zlib compression is available for file compression.
* Strong AES encryption with up to 256 bit keys is available to protect data in transit.
* File checksums support for integrity verification.
* Generates full audit trails of all files transferred

Please note that GoFast is an optional licensed module. Contact your account manager for pricing and additional details.

Two-Factor (RADIUS) authentication

Added the RADIUS protocol to provide Two-Factor Authentication using popular token based services such as RSA SecurID, key fobs, or desktop and mobile apps.

* Uses the standard RADIUS protocol which provides integration into RSA SecurID as well as other token based authentication services.
* Can implement as a primary Login Method or as a secondary authentication type for a user.

SMS Text Messaging

* The SMS service providers of Clickatell, Twilio and Plivo are supported, which can be configured at the global level.
* A Project can send a SMS Text message to a phone number through one of those service providers using the new SMS Task.

SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)

* A new Resource and Project Task was added for sending traps to an SNMP server.
* Provided support for SNMP versions 1 and 2.

Enhancements/fixes to components that were formally in GoAnywhere Services:

* GoDrive Enhancements/Fixes:
  + Created a GoDrive Sync client for the Mac OS X platform.
  + Enhanced the GoDrive list page to visually indicate if a file is locked, shared or has comments.
  + Added menu items to GoDrive files to allow the user to Manage Access, Remove My Access and configure Email Notifications.
  + Added the ability to export GoDrive audit logs.
  + Fixed an issue that prevented GoDrive items from being shared if the recipient had a previous invitation that is pending.
  + Fixed an authority issue where Limited View-Only GoDrive user accounts were able to restore a shared file to a previous revision.
  + Removed the Empty Trash Bin button from users that have only Limited View-Only GoDrive access.
  + Fixed an issue where Limited View-Only GoDrive user accounts were able to download/access locked files.
  + Fixed an issue where GoDrive users without Write permission could delete and restore trash bin items.
  + Fixed a GoDrive Sync issue caused by moving files with certain permissions in a shared folder.
* Added three new Trigger event types:
  + Before AS2 MDN Send - this trigger can call a Project to validate the files that were received in an AS2 message. The Project can return a status to the Trigger to indicate if the MDN should be sent back to the trading partner.
  + Before GoDrive Upload - this trigger can call a Project when GoDrive receives a file. The Project can scan the GoDrive file using ICAP (for antivirus or DLP) or use other tasks to determine whether the file should be allowed or rejected.
  + Before Secure Mail Send - this trigger can call a Project before the Secure Mail notifications are sent to the recipients. The Project could scan the Secure Mail files using ICAP (for antivirus or DLP) or other tasks to determine whether or not to the Secure Mail should be allowed to be sent.
* Added a new Deny Trigger Event task to Projects to conditionally determine whether the new Before Trigger events should proceed.
* Added a new Call Project action to Triggers. This action will call a local Project on GoAnywhere MFT.
