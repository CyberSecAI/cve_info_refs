  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The service path for 'TRIGONE Remote System Monitor Server' is unquoted.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unquoted Service Path"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can potentially escalate privileges by placing a malicious executable in a directory that exists within the unquoted service path. When the service starts, Windows will execute the malicious binary instead of the intended application.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local exploitation. An attacker needs to have write access to a folder in the path of the service executable",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires local access to the system and the ability to create folders and files in a location within the unquoted service path, such as C:\\Program Files\\TRIGONE\\Remote System Monitor Server\\"
