Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46659:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly addresses **CVE-2021-46659**, which is a MariaDB vulnerability leading to a potential Denial of Service (DoS). This is confirmed by:

*   The NetApp advisory specifically mentioning "CVE-2021-46659 MariaDB Vulnerability in NetApp Products".
*   The inclusion of CVE-2021-46659 in the "CVEs" section of the NetApp advisory.
*   The MariaDB bug report (MDEV-25631) mentioning CVE-2021-46659 in the "Issue Links" section.
*   The Fedora mailing list mentioning "CVE-2021-46659 mariadb: Crash executing query with VIEW, aggregate and subquery [fedora-all]".

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the MariaDB optimizer when handling queries involving a VIEW, aggregate functions, and subqueries.
*   Specifically, the MariaDB bug report MDEV-25631 describes "Crash executing query with VIEW, aggregate and subquery" and mentions that a fuzzing tool was used to identify a bug that could result in an abortion.
*   The MariaDB bug report also indicates that the issue was related to an issue in the "Optimizer" component

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The core weakness is an exploitable crash within the MariaDB server's query execution path, specifically within the optimizer component when dealing with complex queries involving views, aggregates, and subqueries
*   This leads to a denial-of-service condition when the server crashes

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. The MariaDB server crashes, making it unavailable to users.
*   As stated in the NetApp advisory, "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to Denial of Service (DoS)."

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is a crafted SQL query that triggers the vulnerability in MariaDB's optimizer.
*   The MariaDB bug report describes a specific SQL script (`fuzz.sql`) designed to trigger the crash

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries against a vulnerable MariaDB instance.
*   According to the CVSS vector provided by NetApp: `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`
    *   **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local):** The attacker must have local access to the system.
    *   **AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low):** The attack is relatively easy to carry out.
    *  **PR:L (Privileges Required: Low):** Only low-level privileges are needed.
    *  **UI:N (User Interaction: None):** No user interaction is required.
    *   **S:U (Scope: Unchanged):** The vulnerability does not affect other components.
    *   **C:N (Confidentiality Impact: None):** There is no impact on confidentiality.
    *   **I:N (Integrity Impact: None):** There is no impact on data integrity.
    *   **A:H (Availability Impact: High):** The attack results in a high impact on system availability.
*   This indicates that a local attacker with low privileges can trigger the vulnerability without user interaction leading to a denial of service

**Additional Notes from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Products:** The NetApp advisory initially indicates that "None" of their products are affected. However, it highlights that multiple NetApp products incorporate MariaDB and that versions prior to 10.7.2 are susceptible. This likely means that although NetApp products were not directly vulnerable, they used a vulnerable component of MariaDB, therefore they were not impacted. This also suggests that updating the MariaDB component in any affected NetApp product would resolve the vulnerability
*   **Fixed Versions:** The MariaDB bug report (MDEV-25631) specifies that the issue is fixed in MariaDB versions: 10.2.42, 10.3.33, 10.4.23, 10.5.14, 10.6.6, and 10.7.2.
*   **Lack of Workarounds:**  NetApp states that there are no workarounds available at this time.
*  **NetApp Advisory:** NetApp assigned the advisory ID **NTAP-20220311-0003** to this vulnerability
*  **Fedora Fixes:** Fedora has issued patches for this vulnerability, as seen in the mailing list content.

In summary, CVE-2021-46659 is a vulnerability within the MariaDB optimizer that can be triggered by a specially crafted query leading to a denial of service. NetApp products incorporating vulnerable versions of MariaDB were initially marked as not affected by NetApp as they did not exhibit the vulnerability directly, and patches from MariaDB and Fedora address the root cause.
