Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the issue:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an assertion failure in the `ecma_object_get_class_name` function within JerryScript. The function did not handle specific object types (BigInt objects in this instance) correctly when retrieving the class name. This resulted in an assertion failure, as `ecma_object_check_class_name_is_object (obj_p)` was triggered.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Object Type Handling:** The `ecma_object_get_class_name` function lacked proper handling for certain object types (specifically BigInt). This indicates an incomplete implementation in the object type checking logic.
- **Assertion Failure:** The assertion failure reveals a coding error, specifically that the assumptions about the types of objects in this function were wrong.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** The immediate impact of this vulnerability is a crash of the JerryScript interpreter. The assertion failure leads to the program aborting, thereby causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **JavaScript Code Execution:** The vulnerability can be triggered through specifically crafted JavaScript code that utilizes `Object.prototype.toString.call` with certain BigInt objects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Execute JavaScript:** An attacker needs the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a JerryScript environment.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `Object.prototype.toString.call` method is used on BigInt objects, specifically when the `Symbol.toStringTag` property is being set.
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) code demonstrates the issue:
  ```javascript
  let custom1 = BigInt(-4294967295);
  let custom2 = Object(BigInt(0));

  Object.prototype.toString.call(BigInt.prototype, Symbol.toStringTag, { value: (custom1) });
  assert.sameValue(Object.prototype.toString.call(custom1), '[object test262]');
  assert.sameValue(Object.prototype.toString.call(custom2), '[object test262]');
  ```
- The crash occurs within the `ecma_object_get_class_name` function, specifically at line 3015, with the assertion `ecma_object_check_class_name_is_object (obj_p)` failing.
- The fix involved adding missing object types to the function `ecma_object_get_class_name`, as indicated by the commit message `Add missing object types for ecma_object_get_class_name`.

This vulnerability is more detailed than a generic CVE description would typically be, as it includes a specific PoC and internal implementation details.
