The provided content is related to CVE-2021-46328.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow caused by an integer overflow when handling string replacement using regular expressions in Moddable-XS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: Writing beyond the allocated memory on the heap.
- Integer overflow: Calculation of the required buffer size results in an integer overflow, leading to a smaller buffer being allocated than required.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption: Overwriting heap memory, potentially leading to crashes, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution. In this case, the AddressSanitizer detected a write of size 1048576 bytes outside of the allocated memory region.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted JavaScript code: A malicious JavaScript program can trigger the vulnerability by using a `String.replace` method with a specially crafted regular expression and replacement string.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute Javascript code within the Moddable-XS environment.
- No specific position is needed, only the ability to run the malicious Javascript within Moddable-XS.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in the `fxPushSubstitutionString` function within `xsString.c` which is called from the `fx_RegExp_prototype_replace` function during string replacement.
- The test case demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability with a large string and a complex regular expression.
- The issue was found by the OWL337 team, and the fix was implemented in commit `6c88625`.
