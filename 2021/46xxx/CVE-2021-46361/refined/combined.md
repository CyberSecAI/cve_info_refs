# Release notes for Magnolia CMS 6.2.12

[LTS release](../../Support/End-of-life-policy/#_long_term_support_lts) • Delivered on September 27, 2021 • Changelog: [11711](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=11711)

**Magnolia CMS 6.2.12** is a bug-fixing and security release that also delivers a number of updates and improvements.

* ![Download icon](../../_images/icons/download.svg) [magnolia-dx-core-webapp-6.2.12.war](https://nexus.magnolia-cms.com/repository/enterprise/info/magnolia/dx/magnolia-dx-core-webapp/6.2.12/magnolia-dx-core-webapp-6.2.12.war)

* ![Download icon](../../_images/icons/download.svg) [magnolia-community-demo-webapp-6.2.12.war](https://nexus.magnolia-cms.com/repository/magnolia.public.releases/info/magnolia/bundle/magnolia-community-demo-webapp/6.2.12/magnolia-community-demo-webapp-6.2.12.war)
* ![Download icon](../../_images/icons/download.svg) [mtk\_2.0.zip](../../_attachments/mtk_2.0.zip) (*as a light module*)

## Connector Pack and Special Feature updates

* Analytics Connector Pack 1.2.2 and 1.1.2 released on September 20, 2021.
* Live Copy 3.2.6 released on September 23, 2021.

See the [Connector Pack and Special Feature changelog](../Connector-Pack-and-Special-Feature-changelog/) for details on these releases.

## Internationalization in Content Editor module (beta version)

To allow [internationalization](../../Administration/Language/Internationalization/) of content in the [Stories app](../../Apps/List-of-apps/Stories-app/),
we have released version 2.1-beta of the [Content Editor module](../../Modules/List-of-modules/Content-Editor-module/).

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.magnolia.editor</groupId>
  <artifactId>content-editor-parent</artifactId>
  <version>2.1-beta</version>
</dependency>
```

If you want to try it out in your webapp, you need to replace the default *Magnolia 5 UI* version of the module.

[CONTEDIT-203](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/CONTEDIT-203)

## Support for *Magnolia 6 UI* in Blossom module

Version 3.4.5 of the [Blossom module](../../Modules/List-of-modules/Blossom-module/) expands support for *Magnolia 6 UI*. For more details,
see [Blossom module release notes](../../Modules/List-of-modules/Blossom-module/Blossom-module-release-notes/) and
[Blossom module: Updating to Magnolia 6.2](../../Modules/List-of-modules/Blossom-module/#_updating_to_magnolia_6_2).

[BLOSSOM-276](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/BLOSSOM-276)

## Improvements

### SPA libraries reach template endpoints by default

The SPA front-end helpers now communicate with Magnolia without manual role setup.
The `magnolia-spa-rendering` submodule of the [Pages module](../../Modules/List-of-modules/Pages-module/) grants the `rest-anonymous` role `GET` access to its
`template-annotations` and `template-definitions` endpoints.

Previously, browsers would report CORS issues or unauthorized access.

[PAGES-483](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/PAGES-483)

### Global path-based locking implemented

Path-based [locking](../../Administration/Architecture/Publishing/#_locking) in the `magnolia-publishing-core`
module has been deprecated and replaced with a global path-based locking implementation in the `magnolia-core` module.

A number of dependencies have also been updated. For this, we have released version 1.2 of the
[Publishing Transactional module](../../Modules/List-of-modules/Publishing-Transactional-module/) (compatible only with Magnolia 6.2.12+).

[EEPUBLISH-39](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/EEPUBLISH-39), [PUBLISHING-125](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/PUBLISHING-125), [MAGNOLIA-8185](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MAGNOLIA-8185)

### Support added for WebP images

As of this release, Magnolia supports the `webp` output format. To align dependencies, we have released version 3.5.0 of the
[Imaging module](../../Modules/List-of-modules/Imaging-module/) (compatible only with Magnolia 6.2.12+).

[MGNLIMG-209](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLIMG-209)

### Complex move operations possible for `CanMoveRuleDefinition`

`info.magnolia.ui.availability.rule.CanMoveRuleDefinition` now uses `info.magnolia.ui.contentapp.browser.drop.AlwaysTrueDropConstraintDefinition` by default.
For more information about the class, see [`dropConstraint`](../../Apps/App-configuration/Content-view-definition/#_dropConstraint).

[MGNLUI-6812](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-6812)

### DAM link field can be used for assets or folders

You can now use `damLinkField` to select an asset or folder. To restrict the field to assets only, see the commented-out lines in the
[DAM `chooser`](https://git.magnolia-cms.com/projects/MODULES/repos/dam/browse/magnolia-dam-app/src/main/resources/dam-app-core/includes/chooser.yaml).

[MGNLDAM-900](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLDAM-900)

### Move action reinstated in DAM module

In the [DAM Core module](../../Modules/List-of-modules/Digital-Asset-Management-module/DAM-Core-module/),
`cutContentAction` has been replaced with the more intuitive `moveAction` of *Magnolia 5 UI*.

[MGNLDAM-949](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLDAM-949)

### Multi-selection possible in chooser dialog

This release comes with a new preconfigured multi field definition. `info.magnolia.ui.field.JcrMultiLinkFieldDefinition` (`jcrMultiLinkField`) allows you
to select multiple values of a single type in a [chooser dialog](../../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Dialog-types/#_chooser_dialog)
to be stored as an array in a single JCR property. For more information, see [Multi field](../../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/Multi-field/).

[MGNLUI-3197](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-3197)

### Resources can be selected from file system and classpath

A new preconfigured link field definition makes it possible to select [resources](../../Developing/Resources/) from the file system and classpath.
Here is an example of how to use `info.magnolia.resources.app.field.ResourceLinkFieldDefinition` (`resourceLinkField`) to link to a resource:

```
form:
  properties:
    resource:
      $type: resourceLinkField
      label: Choose a resource
```

[MGNLRES-362](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLRES-362)

### Validation messages can be configured for upload field

You can use the new `typeAbortMessage` and `sizeAbortMessage` properties in `info.magnolia.ui.field.UploadFieldDefinition`
to configure validation messages for `allowedMimeTypePattern` and `maxUploadSize` respectively.

|  | `allowedMimeTypePattern` is now a comma-separated list of MIME types where all types are allowed by default. |
| --- | --- |

For more information, see [Common upload field properties](../../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/Upload-field/#_common_upload_field_properties).

[MGNLUI-6390](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-6390), [MGNLUI-6543](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-6543)

### Light rich text field can be customized

Version 2.0.2 of the [Content Editor module](../../Modules/List-of-modules/Content-Editor-module/) allows you to customize the [light rich text field](../../Modules/List-of-modules/Content-Editor-module/Light-rich-text-field/).
For example, you can change the color of the field, toggle the typing direction, or enable the CKEditor-native spell checker. See [Light rich text field: Customization](../../Modules/List-of-modules/Content-Editor-module/Light-rich-text-field/#_customization) for more details.

The light rich text field is used as a text block in the [Stories app](../../Apps/List-of-apps/Stories-app/) or in custom implementations of the Content Editor.

[CONTEDIT-183](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/CONTEDIT-183)

## Notable bug fixes

* Preview as visitor now works with any default JVM language ([MGNLPN-564](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLPN-564)).
* The DAM chooser does not crash anymore when the MIME type of an asset is missing ([MGNLDAM-902](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLDAM-902)).
* Users can no longer move a page they are not allowed to create ([PAGES-444](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/PAGES-444)).
* Deleting a page does not throw an error in `MetaDataBasedTemplateDefinitionAssignment` ([PAGES-333](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/PAGES-333)).
* Page/component dialogs and column filters are populated only once as `PageTemplateDataProvider` is no longer automatically refreshed on value context changes ([PAGES-334](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/PAGES-334)).
* The [SPA template annotations endpoint](../../Developing/API/SPA-templating-API/#_spa_template_annotations_endpoint) now resolves only template annotations
  whose nodes have template definitions ([PAGES-503](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/PAGES-503)).
* Deleting a property in the JCR Browser app does not delete the parent node or publish changes to the public instance ([MGNLUI-6811](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-6811)).
* In the [**Edit user profile**](../../Administration/Security/Users/#_editing_user_profile) dialog, the email address you enter is now validated using `emailValidator` ([MGNLUI-6269](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-6269)).
* Previously selected items in the grid are not randomly deselected when a user clicks outside any of the selection checkboxes ([MGNLUI-6800](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-6800)).
* Items in [select fields](../../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/Select-field/) are no longer automatically sorted. To sort these items, you must now set
  `info.magnolia.ui.datasource.optionlist.OptionListDefinition#sort` to `true` ([MGNLUI-6672](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-6672)).
* Selected items in [twin-column fields](../../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/Twin-column-field/) are readable again in Chrome ([MGNLUI-6568](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-6568)).
* `converterClass` is not ignored anymore in [link fields](../../Developing/Templating/Dialog-definition/Field-definition/List-of-fields/Link-field/) where `textInputAllowed` is set to `true` ([MGNLUI-6834](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-6834)).
* Input text is now saved for all languages in link fields where `textInputAllowed` is set to `true` ([MGNLUI-6862](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-6862)).
* When using converted *Magnolia 5 UI* link fields in *Magnolia 6 UI* apps, `textInputAllowed` is automatically set to `true` for compatibility reasons ([MGNLUI-6835](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-6835)).
* When a dialog contains fields with i18n content, the footer no longer disappears on switching between languages multiple times
  ([MGNLUI-6583](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-6583)).
* Admincentral does not freeze anymore after the first login ([MGNLUI-6736](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MGNLUI-6736)).
* The CORS filter now precedes the URI security filter in the [Magnolia filter chain](../../Administration/Architecture/Request-processing-and-filters/)
  ([MAGNOLIA-8180](https://magnolia-cms.atlassian.net/browse/MAGNOLIA-8180)).
