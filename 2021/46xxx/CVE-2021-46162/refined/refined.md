Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-46162:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing NEU files. This results in an out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated data structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The application attempts to read data beyond the allocated memory region.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could allow them to take control of the affected system.
*   **Information Leakage:** The vulnerability could lead to information disclosure due to the out-of-bounds read. This is described in the Siemens advisory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File:** The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a specially crafted malicious NEU file with the vulnerable Simcenter Femap application.
*   **User Interaction Required:** Exploitation requires user interaction as the target must open the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access or Remote File Delivery:**  An attacker needs to be able to get the victim to open the malicious file. This could be achieved through local access or through social engineering or other means to have the victim open the file on their computer.
*   **Knowledge of File Format:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious .NEU file that triggers the vulnerability.
