The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in HHG Multistore software but does not specify a CVE ID. Therefore, it is **UNRELATED** to CVE-2021-46447. However, here is a summary of the vulnerabilities described:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Disabled Certificate Validation:** The software disables certificate validation in `core/classes/class.afterbuy.php`, potentially exposing it to man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **SQL Injection:** Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities are present in various parameters like `cID`, `agID`, `aagID`, and `box_group_id`.
    *   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET requests with crafted parameters.
    *   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to dump the database.
*   **Unrestricted File Uploads:**  No filtering is performed on uploaded image files, allowing arbitrary file uploads, such as PHP webshells.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Uploading files via forms accepting images.
    *   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Insecure Password Handling:**  The software uses the broken MD5 algorithm to store passwords with a static salt.
*   **Open Redirect:**  The `redirect` module allows redirection to external sources using the `goto` parameter.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating the `goto` parameter in the URL.
    *   **Impact:** Can be used in phishing attacks.
*   **Path Traversal:**  The `filemanager.php` script is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing the download of arbitrary files from the server.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating the `path` parameter in the URL.
    *   **Impact:**  Allows attackers to read sensitive server files.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (Stored):** Stored XSS vulnerability through the "state" parameter (called "county" in UI) during order creation.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious JavaScript in the "state" parameter during the order creation process. The injected script is then executed in the admin panel when an employee processes the order.
    *    **Impact:** Allows execution of malicious scripts in the admin's browser, leading to potential account compromise, data theft, or further exploitation.
*   **Coupon Codes:**  Coupon codes use a static salt which is considered a vulnerability
*   **Hidden User:**  User profiles can be hidden from the backend UI by manipulating the address ID.

**General Weaknesses:**

*   Lack of input validation.
*   Use of insecure cryptographic practices.
*   Lack of security controls on file uploads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Basic understanding of web application vulnerabilities.
*   Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   For stored XSS, the attacker would require a user account, and the ability to create orders

**Additional Notes:**
*   The software is considered end-of-life, with the last version published 4-5 years ago.
*   The vendor is unresponsive and unlikely to patch these vulnerabilities.
