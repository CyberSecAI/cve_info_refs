  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Invalid memory access during allocation of a box of type 'co64' due to an invalid size calculation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Memory corruption",
    "Segmentation fault"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service due to a segmentation fault.",
  "Attack vectors": "Processing a crafted MP4 file with the `MP4Box` utility that triggers the faulty size calculation during `co64` box allocation.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to provide a malformed MP4 file to the vulnerable `MP4Box` utility."
