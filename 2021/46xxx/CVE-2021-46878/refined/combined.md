### @DavidKorczynski **[DavidKorczynski](/DavidKorczynski)** commented [Feb 23, 2021](#issue-814881089) • edited Loading

This a fairly important fix, in that many plugins call `flb_pack_msgpack_to_json_format`, however there are some important bugs in this function due to missing checking of the type of msgpack objects. This leads to type confusion bugs that interprets whatever is on the stack as msgpack maps and arrays. This leads to all sorts of trouble.
