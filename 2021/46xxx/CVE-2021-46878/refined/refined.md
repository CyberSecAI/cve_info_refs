The provided content is related to CVE-2021-46878.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing checks on the type of msgpack objects within the `flb_pack_msgpack_to_json_format` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Type confusion bugs are present. The function interprets data on the stack as msgpack maps and arrays, even when it is not.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The type confusion leads to issues in processing msgpack data, and can lead to various problems.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could potentially provide specially crafted msgpack data that triggers the type confusion vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need the ability to influence the msgpack data being processed by the `flb_pack_msgpack_to_json_format` function. This could be through a plugin or other means where an attacker can control the input.
