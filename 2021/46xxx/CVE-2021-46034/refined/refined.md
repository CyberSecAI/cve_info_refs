- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of character verification/input sanitization on the nickname field in the registration interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the nickname field. When an administrator views the user details (or when a user views the profile of another malicious user), the injected script executes within the administrator's or user's browser, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the registration interface, where a user can input a malicious script in the nickname field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to register an account and insert the malicious payload into the nickname field.
