Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46458:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in Victor CMS v1.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion. This could allow the attacker to take full control over the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted POST request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted POST request to `admin/posts.php?source=add_post`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. They would also need to be able to craft a malicious SQL query within the `post_title` parameter of the POST request.
