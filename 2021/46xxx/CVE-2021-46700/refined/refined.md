Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46700:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A double free vulnerability exists in the `sixel_encoder_output_without_macro` function within `encoder.c` of libsixel version 1.8.6. This function is called by `sixel_encoder_encode_frame`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Double free: The same memory is freed twice which leads to memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a crash due to memory corruption.
- The specific impact would be a denial of service due to the application termination.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted input file to the `libsixel` library.
- The vulnerable code is located within the function that processes image frames during the encoding process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted input file to the application using libsixel.
- No specific privilege or prior access is required.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was reported with a Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrating the crash.
- The crash occurs within the `_int_free` function, called by `sixel_encoder_output_without_macro`.
- The vulnerability is located at line 831 in the `encoder.c` file.
- The vulnerability is assigned CWE-415 (Double Free).
