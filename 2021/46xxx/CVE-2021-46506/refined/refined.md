{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A failed assertion in `src/jsiValue.c:181: ValueFree` indicates a memory management issue, likely a double-free or use-after-free. Specifically, the assertion `v->d.lval != v` suggests a value is attempting to free itself, which is an error in the value handling logic.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Double-free",
      "Use-after-free",
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability causes the program `jsish` to abort due to the failed assertion. This can lead to denial of service. It can potentially be exploited to achieve code execution by causing memory corruption, however, the provided information does not describe this in detail.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves crafting a specific Javascript code using jsish to trigger the erroneous memory management within the ValueFree function. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by the `applyTags` function, utilizing string manipulation.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to execute crafted javascript code using the `jsish` interpreter in a vulnerable version."
