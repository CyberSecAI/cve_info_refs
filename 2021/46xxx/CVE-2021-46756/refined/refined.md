Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46756:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within the `SVC_MAP_USER_STACK` system call in the AMD Secure Processor (ASP) bootloader.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The ASP bootloader does not adequately validate inputs to the `SVC_MAP_USER_STACK` system call.
- **Malformed/Invalid Syscalls:** A malicious or compromised UApp (User Application) or ABL (AMD Bootloader) can send malformed or invalid syscalls to the bootloader.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Sending malformed syscalls can cause a denial of service.
- **Loss of Integrity:** The vulnerability can lead to a loss of integrity, which might indicate unauthorized modifications to data or system state.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious UApp or ABL:** An attacker needs to have control or a compromised UApp or ABL.
- **Sending Malformed Syscalls:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending malformed or invalid system calls to the ASP bootloader.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Privileged Access:** The attacker needs some level of privilege to be able to load and execute a malicious UApp or ABL. This can be achieved through prior compromise of the system.
- **Code Execution:** The attacker needs the ability to execute code within the system to send the malformed syscall to the vulnerable function.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as **Medium** severity.
*   The vulnerability affects AMD EPYC servers, AMD Athlon, Ryzen, and Threadripper processors.
*   Mitigation involves updating the AGESA firmware/BIOS to the versions specified in the provided tables.
*   The vulnerability affects systems using SEV.
*   This is an internally reported vulnerability.
