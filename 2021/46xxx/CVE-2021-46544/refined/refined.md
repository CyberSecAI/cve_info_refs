{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted JavaScript code that leads to a segmentation fault (SEGV) within the mjs JavaScript engine when accessing an array property using `getprop_builtin_array`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is due to an issue in the `getprop_builtin_array` function within mjs's execution engine that fails to correctly handle specific cases when accessing array properties, leading to dereferencing of an invalid address, specifically null.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation results in a segmentation fault, causing the mjs engine to crash. This can lead to denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the execution of a specially crafted JavaScript file using the mjs engine.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute the malicious JavaScript file on a system using the vulnerable mjs JavaScript engine."
