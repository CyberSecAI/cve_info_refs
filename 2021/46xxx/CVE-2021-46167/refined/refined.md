{
  "CVE-2021-46167": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "A structural problem in password authentication where the password verification function's code is exposed to reverse engineering, allowing modification of the EAX register to bypass authentication.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "CWE-256",
        "CWE-259",
        "CWE-261"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can bypass password authentication, even with an incorrect password. This allows for deletion of users, addition of malicious users, and unauthorized access to encrypted data.",
      "attack_vectors": "Local access to the device's software is required to reverse engineer the authentication function and modify the EAX register.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to reverse engineer the software and modify the EAX register during password verification. This involves understanding assembly code and memory manipulation."
