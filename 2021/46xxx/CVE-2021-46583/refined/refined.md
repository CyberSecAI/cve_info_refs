Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-46583:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the parsing of J2K image files within Bentley MicroStation CONNECT and MicroStation-based applications. Specifically, crafted data within a J2K file can trigger a write operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-Bounds Write:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. Maliciously crafted J2K files can cause the software to write data outside the intended memory area.
*   **Use-After-Free**: This is indicated in the summary, and is caused when the program attempts to access memory after it has been freed, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to a complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious J2K File:** An attacker would need to create a specially crafted J2K image file containing malicious data.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, either by opening a malicious J2K file or by visiting a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Crafted J2K File:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious J2K image file.
*   **User Lure:** The attacker must get the victim to open the malicious file. No special privileges are required for the attack itself, but the attacker needs to get the user to open the file.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
*   Bentley has released updates for MicroStation and Bentley View to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is tracked by ZDI as ZDI-CAN-15377.
*   CVSS v3.1 score is 7.8, with the vector: AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. This indicates a high severity vulnerability exploitable locally with user interaction, which results in high impacts to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
*   Affected products: MicroStation CONNECT, and potentially other MicroStation-based applications.
*   Affected versions are prior to 10.16.02.*, while the mitigated version is 10.16.02.* and newer.
