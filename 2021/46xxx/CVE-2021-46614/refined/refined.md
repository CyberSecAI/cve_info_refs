Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-46614:

**Root Cause:**
- An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the parsing of J2K images within Bentley MicroStation and MicroStation-based applications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read: Crafted data within a J2K image can cause the software to read beyond the allocated buffer.
- Use-after-free (also mentioned in the advisory for a set of CVEs, including this one)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious J2K file: An attacker provides a maliciously crafted J2K file that triggers the vulnerability when opened by the affected software.
- User interaction is required: The target user must open the malicious J2K file for the exploit to be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious J2K file with the specific crafted data.
- The attacker needs to get the user to open the malicious J2K file in an affected version of MicroStation.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
- Bentley has released updated versions of MicroStation and Bentley View to mitigate this vulnerability.
- The advisory mentions multiple CVEs related to similar out-of-bounds and use-after-free vulnerabilities when parsing J2K files.
