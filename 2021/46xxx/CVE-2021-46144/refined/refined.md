Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2021-46144 from the provided content:

**Vulnerability Summary**
*   **Description**: Roundcube versions prior to 1.4.13 and 1.5.x before 1.5.2 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This vulnerability is triggered by crafted Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) token sequences embedded within HTML email messages.

**Root Cause**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of HTML email messages, specifically when processing CSS token sequences.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The primary weakness is the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied CSS input. This allows for the injection of malicious code via CSS within HTML email messages.

**Impact of Exploitation**
*   **XSS**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could enable an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's session. This can lead to:
    *   Stealing session cookies.
    *   Defacing web pages.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors**
*   **Email**: The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted HTML email message containing malicious CSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
*   **Network Access**: The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the vulnerable Roundcube installation.
*   **User Interaction**: The victim user needs to open/preview the malicious email for the exploit to trigger.

**Technical Details**
*   The vulnerability is triggered by crafted CSS token sequences within HTML emails.
*   The fix involves sanitizing the CSS within HTML messages.
