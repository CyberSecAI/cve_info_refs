Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46198:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `email` parameter of the Courier Management System 1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `email` parameter before using it in an SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Blind SQL Injection:** Specifically, a time-based blind SQL injection is demonstrated where the attacker doesn't get direct output from the query, but can infer execution by timing delays.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially exfiltrate sensitive data from the database. In the provided example, the attacker attempts to use the `load_file()` function which could be used to read arbitrary files on the server.
- **Account Takeover:**  The attacker can take control of the administrator account by exploiting the SQL injection flaw. This could lead to complete control of the system.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could also gain access to other potentially sensitive information stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP POST request where the malicious SQL payload is injected into the `email` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.
- **SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax and be able to craft SQL injection payloads.
- **No Authentication Required:** The provided exploit examples do not indicate the need for prior authentication, suggesting that the vulnerability can be exploited without valid user credentials.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided github link contains proof of concept code and additional documentation related to this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by nu11secur1ty.
- The vulnerable software is the Courier Management System version 1.0.
- The exploit uses a time-based blind SQL injection technique, using `SLEEP(3)` function.
- The payload also utilizes `load_file()` to attempt to interact with an external server.
