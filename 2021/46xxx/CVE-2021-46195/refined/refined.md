- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled recursion in `libiberty/rust-demangle.c`. Specifically, the `demangle_path` function calls itself recursively, and the depth of recursion is not properly controlled. This is triggered by crafted input to the rust demangler which results in the program entering a recursive loop.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uncontrolled recursion leads to stack exhaustion.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Stack overflow leading to a segmentation fault and denial of service due to the program crashing. Attackers can cause excessive resource consumption such as CPU and memory.
- **Attack vectors**: By providing a specially crafted input to the `c++filt` utility which calls the vulnerable rust demangler. The input is a mangled rust symbol string.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to supply arbitrary input to the `c++filt` utility.
