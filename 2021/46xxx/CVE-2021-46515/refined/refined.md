Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An assertion failure occurs in the `mjs_execute` function within `src/mjs_exec.c` at line 949. The assertion `mjs_stack_size(&mjs->scopes) >= scopes_len` fails, indicating a discrepancy between the expected stack size and the actual size of the scopes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The core issue lies in how the mjs (likely a JavaScript engine) manages its stack of scopes during execution. The failure of the assertion suggests a potential stack overflow or underflow, or an incorrect calculation of required stack space for scopes.
- There's a vulnerability within the JavaScript engine's scope management, which leads to the program aborting due to the assertion failure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The immediate impact is a crash of the mjs interpreter. This could be leveraged for a denial-of-service attack if the program can be made to execute the vulnerable code path.

**Attack vectors:**
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) JavaScript code within `poc.js` triggers the vulnerability, this is the attack vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute crafted JavaScript code, likely within an environment using the vulnerable version of mjs.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided PoC JavaScript code is:
```javascript
(JSON.stringify([1, 2, 3]))(((JSON.stringify - (6) * 10000) - 20 * 9060)([([JSON.parse(JSON.stringify([(0)]))])]));
```
- The issue was found by the OWL337 team.
- The commit `b1b6eac` is associated with the vulnerable code.
- The assertion failure occurs in `src/mjs_exec.c:949`.
- The build platform was Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS (Linux 5.4.0-44-generic x86_64)
- The build command was: `$(DOCKER_GCC) $(CFLAGS) $(TOP_MJS_SOURCES) $(TOP_COMMON_SOURCES) -o $(PROG)`
