  "CVE-2021-46019": {
    "description": "An untrusted pointer dereference in rec_db_destroy() at rec-db.c of GNU Recutils v1.8.90 can lead to a segmentation fault or application crash.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `rec_db_destroy()` function, specifically due to an untrusted pointer dereference.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Untrusted pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A segmentation fault and application crash, leading to denial of service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By processing a crafted recfile, the vulnerability can be triggered.",
      "The vulnerable function `rec_db_destroy()` is called during the process of reading the recfile"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted recfile to the recutils tool.",
    "additional_details": [
      "The vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted input file, which causes an out-of-bounds read during the destruction of a recfile database.",
      "The issue occurs because the `list_free` function is called using a pointer retrieved from the input file, potentially leading to a crash when the retrieved pointer is invalid."
