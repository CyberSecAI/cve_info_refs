Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-46558:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Issabel PBX 20200102 is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) due to insufficient input sanitization when adding new users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "add new user" function. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code which is then stored in the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- When a user logs in using the account created with malicious javascript, the injected code is executed in the user's browser.
- The attacker can potentially:
    - Steal session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    - Deface the application by injecting arbitrary HTML or JavaScript.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Perform other actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves adding a new user through the application's user management interface.
- An attacker inserts malicious JavaScript code into the username, password and/or description fields.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to access the "add new user" functionality which likely requires administrative access or other authorized user privileges to the Issabel PBX system.
- The attacker also needs to be able to log into the system using the account they created.
