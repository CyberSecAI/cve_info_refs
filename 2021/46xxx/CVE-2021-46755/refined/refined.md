Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-46755:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-46755

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Failure to unmap certain SysHub mappings in error paths of the ASP (AMD Secure Processor) bootloader.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability lies in the ASP bootloader's handling of SysHub mappings, specifically when errors occur during the mapping process.
- The bootloader fails to properly unmap these SysHub resources if an error happens.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with a malicious bootloader could exploit this vulnerability to exhaust SysHub resources.
- This resource exhaustion leads to a potential denial of service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker requires the ability to execute a malicious bootloader on the system.
- This suggests the attacker already has some level of control over the initial boot process of the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a malicious bootloader.
- The attacker needs the ability to load and execute this malicious bootloader on the target system. This implies a pre-existing level of access or control over the boot process.

**Summary:**
This vulnerability in the AMD Secure Processor bootloader allows a malicious actor with a compromised bootloader to cause a denial-of-service by exhausting SysHub resources due to improper unmapping during error conditions.
