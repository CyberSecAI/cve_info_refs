The provided content relates to CVE-2021-46548.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a segmentation fault (SEGV) occurring in the `add_lineno_map_item` function within the `src/mjs_bcode.c` file of the mjs (embedded JavaScript engine) project. The crash is triggered by a crafted JavaScript input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core vulnerability lies in how the mjs engine handles bytecode generation and line number mapping. The `add_lineno_map_item` function is crashing, likely due to incorrect memory access. The provided stack trace shows that a crafted Javascript payload can reach this vulnerable function. The vulnerability can be reached during parsing of expressions including comparison, equality, bitwise and logical operations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a segmentation fault, leading to a crash of the mjs engine and any application embedding it. This denial of service condition can disrupt the functionality of applications that rely on this engine.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted Javascript code execution. Specifically, the provided `poc.js` demonstrates how to trigger the crash. The vulnerability is reachable by the parsing of the Javascript code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within an environment using the vulnerable mjs engine to trigger the vulnerability.
