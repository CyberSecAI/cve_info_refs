## Commit

[Permalink](/nginx/njs/commit/39e8fa1b7db1680654527f8fa0e9ee93b334ecba)

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Fixed Function.prototype.apply() with slow arrays.

```
Previously, the function had two issues:
   * array->start was referenced without checking for fast array flag
   * the created arguments list was not sanity-checked for its length,
     which can be very large.

The fix is to remove micro-optimization for arrays and introduce limit
size for arguments list.

This closes [#449](https://github.com/nginx/njs/issues/449) issue in Github.
