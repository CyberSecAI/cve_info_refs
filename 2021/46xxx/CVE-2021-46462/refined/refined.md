{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the `Function.prototype.apply()` implementation in njs, specifically due to improper handling of array-like objects used as arguments. There are two key issues:\n\n1.  The code directly accesses `array->start` without validating if the fast array flag is set.\n2.  The function does not validate the length of the arguments list which may be very large, leading to excessive memory allocation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of array-like objects in `Function.prototype.apply()`",
      "Lack of validation of fast array flag when accessing `array->start`",
       "Missing check on the size of argument lists for `Function.prototype.apply()`"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive memory allocation. As evidenced by the stack dump, the specific exploit triggers a segmentation fault during prototype setting, leading to a crash.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a specially crafted array-like object as an argument to the `apply` method of a function in Javascript executed by the vulnerable NGINX njs module.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to execute JavaScript code through the NGINX njs module. No specific attacker position is mentioned beyond the general requirement of interacting with the vulnerable module."
