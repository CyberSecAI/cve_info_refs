Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-46650

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DGN files in Bentley MicroStation CONNECT. This can cause a read operation beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The application attempts to read data from a memory location outside the bounds of the allocated buffer.
- Lack of proper input validation: The software doesn't adequately check the data within DGN files, allowing for crafted data to trigger the out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can potentially read sensitive information from the application's memory due to the out-of-bounds read.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: While the immediate impact is information disclosure, the vulnerability can potentially be chained with other exploits to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted DGN files: An attacker would need to create a specially crafted DGN file to trigger the vulnerability.
- User interaction is required: The target must open the malicious DGN file using a vulnerable version of MicroStation CONNECT or be lured to a malicious page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or have access to a malicious DGN file.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into opening the malicious file using the vulnerable software.
