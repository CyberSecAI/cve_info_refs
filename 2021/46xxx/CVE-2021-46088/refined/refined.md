Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46088:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a "feature" in Zabbix that allows users with the "Zabbix Admin" role to create actions that execute custom shell scripts on the application server. These scripts run in the context of the application user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Insecure Feature:** The ability for "Zabbix Admin" users to define and execute arbitrary shell commands on the application server is inherently insecure.
-   **Lack of Input Validation:** There is no restriction on the commands that can be executed, allowing for potentially malicious code to be run.
-   **Privilege Escalation:** While the script is run under the application user, that user often has extensive access, such as database access and access to secrets.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Full server compromise**: Attackers can execute arbitrary system commands on the Zabbix application server with the privileges of the application user.
-   **Database compromise:** The application user typically has full database access, which could be exploited by an attacker.
-   **Data exfiltration/modification:** Attackers can access sensitive data and modify the application or database.
-   **Denial of Service:** Attackers can perform actions to disrupt the Zabbix server and its functionality.
-   **Lateral movement:** In some scenarios, the compromised server could be used to access other systems.
-   **Application destruction:** The provided PoC includes a command to destroy the database

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Web Interface:** The primary attack vector is through the Zabbix web interface where "Zabbix Admin" users can create actions with remote commands and custom scripts.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **"Zabbix Admin" Role:** An attacker must have a Zabbix user account with the "Zabbix Admin" role, which is granted through the UI.
-   **Access to Zabbix Interface:** The attacker needs network access to the Zabbix web interface.

**Additional details:**

-   The vulnerability was reported to Zabbix in 2019, and was assigned CVE-2021-46088, but the issue was not properly fixed.
-   The issue is present in Zabbix versions 4.0 LTS, 4.2, 4.4 and 5.0 LTS.
-   Zabbix 5.4 changed how scripts are managed, requiring explicit permission to use the Administration->Scripts UI element. However, the Super Admin role still has the ability to create custom scripts by default.
-   The Zabbix team initially considered this a "misconfiguration" rather than a vulnerability.
-   The provided text includes example exploits, including destroying the database, privilege escalation, and remote shell access.
-   The provided text includes example workarounds using database triggers.
