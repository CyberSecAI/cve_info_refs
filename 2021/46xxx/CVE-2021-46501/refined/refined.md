The provided content relates to CVE-2021-46501.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-use-after-free vulnerability occurs in the `SortSubCmd` function within `src/jsiArray.c` at line 958.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-use-after-free. The vulnerability occurs when a memory location is freed and then subsequently accessed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The program crashes due to a heap-use-after-free error, which can potentially lead to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by calling the `findIndex` function on an array, within the callback function of which the array is sorted via the `sort` function which modifies the array and pushes elements into a result array.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute a crafted JavaScript code using the vulnerable jsish interpreter. This code should use the `findIndex` and `sort` functions in specific way described in the test case within the report.
