The provided content is related to CVE-2021-46113.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The KEA-Hotel-ERP application allows arbitrary file uploads without proper extension verification, specifically within the room creation functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Unrestricted file upload: The application does not validate the extension of uploaded files.
*   Lack of file type sanitization: Absence of checks to ensure the uploaded file is of an expected type (e.g., image) and not an executable file like PHP.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Remote code execution (RCE): By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
*   File upload: The vulnerability is triggered through the file upload functionality located in the room creation feature within the application's admin panel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs access to the admin panel of the KEA-Hotel-ERP application to upload the malicious file.
*   The attacker must be able to craft or obtain a malicious PHP file to upload.
