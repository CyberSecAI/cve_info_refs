Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46007:

**CVE Description:**
The provided content states: "The backend of a page is executing the 'ping' command, and the input field does not adequately filter special symbols. This can lead to command injection attacks."

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the inadequate sanitization of user-supplied input before it's used in a system command. Specifically, the backend of a page is executing a "ping" command using user-provided input without proper filtering of special characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands into the "ping" command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious commands, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the router, leading to a variety of impacts including but not limited to:
    - Complete compromise of the device
    - Data exfiltration
    - Denial of service
    - Further network compromise

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is the web interface of the affected Totolink A3100R router, where an input field is vulnerable to command injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable router's web interface.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Input:** The attacker must know the specific vulnerable input field being used to execute the "ping" command and which special characters to inject.

**Additional Information**
- The provided content mentions that "It seems that all special symbols are not checked," which highlights the lack of proper input validation on the device.
- A YouTube video is referenced, further indicating that a PoC of this vulnerability has been developed and demonstrated.

In summary, CVE-2021-46007 is a command injection vulnerability in the Totolink A3100R router due to insufficient input validation on a web interface that uses the "ping" command. This vulnerability could lead to a complete compromise of the affected device.
