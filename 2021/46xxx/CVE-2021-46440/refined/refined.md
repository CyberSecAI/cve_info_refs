Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed in the mentioned pull request:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the documentation plugin in Strapi handled authentication cookies. The original implementation likely had a flaw in how it set or validated authentication cookies when accessing the documentation, which was a potential security risk.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The specific weakness isn't explicitly detailed, but it is inferred as a security issue.  It is related to the authentication cookie mechanism within the documentation plugin. The commit message mentions "change documentation auth cookie system," suggesting a flawed system existed previously, which is now modified. The vulnerability is categorized as a "security" issue and is located within the "plugin:documentation".

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The provided text doesn't explicitly describe the impact, but since it's a security issue related to authentication, potential impacts could include:

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the documentation if the cookie mechanism was weak.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Depending on the vulnerability details, sensitive information might be exposed through the documentation if authentication was bypassed.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector would involve exploiting the flawed cookie mechanism. The documentation does not go into further detail.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker would need to identify and exploit the vulnerability in the cookie handling of the documentation plugin, implying:

*   **Network Access:** The attacker would need network access to the Strapi instance and the ability to interact with the documentation routes.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** Understanding of web application vulnerabilities, cookie handling, and the Strapi framework would be required.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The pull request was merged into the `releases/v3.6.9` branch, indicating this was a fix for the Strapi v3.6.9 version.
*   The change is related to the authentication system for the documentation plugin, suggesting the issue is related to how authentication is handled.
*   The commit introduced changes in `packages/strapi-plugin-documentation/config/policies/index.js`. This file likely contains the configuration for authentication policies related to the documentation plugin.
