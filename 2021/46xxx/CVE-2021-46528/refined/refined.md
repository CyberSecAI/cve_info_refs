The provided content is related to CVE-2021-46528.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a segmentation fault (SEGV) triggered by a specific sequence of operations involving function calls and `apply` within the mjs JavaScript engine. The issue arises when the `apply` method is used on a function, resulting in a memory access violation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Segmentation Fault (SEGV): The primary vulnerability is a crash due to an illegal memory access.
- Incorrect Function Call Handling: The specific sequence of function calls, particularly the usage of `apply`, triggers the fault, indicating an issue in how the engine handles such situations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: The exploitation leads to a segmentation fault, effectively crashing the mjs JavaScript engine. This could lead to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Execution of malicious JavaScript code: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by providing a crafted JavaScript code that triggers the described function calling sequence and the usage of `apply`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code: The attacker must be able to provide and execute the malicious JavaScript payload using the mjs engine.
