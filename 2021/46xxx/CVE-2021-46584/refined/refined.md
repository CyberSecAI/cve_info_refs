Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-46584:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is located within the parsing of J2K image files in Bentley MicroStation CONNECT.
*   Crafted data in a J2K image can trigger a write past the end of an allocated buffer, resulting in an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** A memory safety violation occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can leverage the out-of-bounds write vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious J2K File:** An attacker can craft a malicious J2K image file containing specific data to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction. The target user must open the malicious J2K file using an affected version of MicroStation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious J2K file.
*   The attacker needs to entice a user to open the malicious file on a vulnerable system running MicroStation CONNECT.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
*   Bentley has released updates to address this vulnerability.
*   The provided content includes multiple CVEs that relate to the same vulnerability within the same affected application and file format, likely due to the various root causes.

**CVSS Score:**
*   7.8, AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
