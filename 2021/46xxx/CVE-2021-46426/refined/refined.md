Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-46426:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in `app/admin/subnets/find_free_section_subnets.php`, which allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and the absence of CSRF tokens in the form, which makes it susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reflected XSS:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when displaying the "find subnets" page, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **CSRF:** The forms in `app/admin/subnets/find_free_section_subnets.php` lack CSRF tokens, making it possible for an attacker to trick a logged-in user into performing unwanted actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **XSS:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
*   **CSRF:** An attacker could craft a malicious web page that, when visited by a logged-in admin user, forces the user's browser to make requests to the vulnerable application. This could allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the admin user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An attacker can create a malicious HTML page that contains the crafted form with the malicious javascript code and send a link of it to a logged in admin user.
*   The vulnerable page is `app/admin/subnets/find_free_section_subnets.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious web page and lure a logged-in user of the affected application to visit it.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target application; the attack relies on the user being authenticated.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by Celso Bezerra of Tempest Security Intelligence.
*   The vendor fixed the issues by implementing CSRF tokens and sanitizing user-provided input in the affected file.
*   The fix was implemented in commit `6c1f72816d6ac634e9c174057e008717d959f351`.
*   The vulnerability is located in the find free subnets functionality within phpipam.
*   The vulnerability is present in phpipam version 1.4.4, and possibly earlier versions.
*   The fix adds a CSRF token to the `find_free_section_subnets.php` form, and uses `escape_input()` to sanitize the `sectionid` parameter.
