Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-46636:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the parsing of DGN files by Bentley MicroStation CONNECT. Specifically, crafted data within a DGN file can trigger a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The software attempts to read data from a memory location that is outside the allocated buffer for DGN file processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running MicroStation. This could allow attackers to take control of the system, access sensitive data, or cause other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a malicious DGN file. An attacker crafts a DGN file with specific data that triggers the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- User interaction is required, such as opening a malicious DGN file, or visiting a malicious page, making it a Remote Code Execution vulnerability that requires a user to perform an action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious DGN file.
- The attacker must be able to entice a user of an affected version of Bentley MicroStation to open the malicious DGN file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Bentley by Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
- Bentley has released updates to address this vulnerability, specifically MicroStation versions 10.16.02.* and later.
- The vulnerability is one of multiple out-of-bounds vulnerabilities addressed in Bentley advisory BE-2021-0009.
- The CVSS score is 7.8 which indicates a high severity vulnerability.
