Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2021-46547** as it describes a crash in the mjs project (likely related to CVE-2021-46547)

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details:

**Root Cause:**
- The crash is triggered by specific JavaScript code involving nested `chr` and `JSON.parse` calls, specifically when parsing the string '0.255.0.0' using `JSON.parse`, within the context of the `chr` and `print` functions

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A segmentation fault (SEGV) occurs within the `mjs` binary.
- The specific location of the crash is at memory address `0x55dae32d717e` inside `/usr/local/bin/mjs`. This indicates a potential memory corruption issue or an attempt to access invalid memory.
- The AddressSanitizer reports the crash as a "WRITE memory access" which means the code is trying to write to a memory location it should not be writing to

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The program crashes, leading to a denial of service (DoS).
- The provided crash information from the AddressSanitizer suggests a memory safety issue, which could potentially be exploited for more severe consequences like arbitrary code execution if a similar vulnerability were to exist at other locations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by executing malicious or crafted JavaScript code that leverages the vulnerable combination of `chr`, `print`, and `JSON.parse` calls.
- The specific crafted code is included within the provided content

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the `mjs` environment.
- No specific user interaction or privilege level is explicitly mentioned but, any process able to execute a javascript code in the targeted mjs environment could potentially trigger this crash.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided `poc.js` is the proof of concept code that triggers the crash, thus it provides explicit detail into the vulnerability.
- The report includes AddressSanitizer output, which provides precise information about the location and type of memory access violation causing the crash.
- The stack trace information is limited, making it more challenging to pinpoint the exact cause of the crash and understand more details about the state of the execution when the vulnerability is triggered.
