Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46790:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `ntfsck` tool within the NTFS-3G driver.
- The `check_file_record` function processes the update sequence array (USA) of an MFT record.
- The function lacks proper boundary checks when applying the USA.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Heap Overflow:** The code writes bytes from the USA beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a heap overflow. Specifically, the loop iterates `usa_count` times, and calculates the `fixup` pointer using `buffer+NTFS_BLOCK_SIZE*i-2`. When `i` is large enough, the pointer `fixup` goes out of bounds from `buffer`.
- **Insufficient Validation:** The code uses `assert_u32_equal`, which only reports errors and does not stop execution, thus the loop can still write to out-of-bound memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The heap overflow can be exploited to overwrite heap metadata, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the ntfsck process.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If `ntfsck` or `ntfs-3g` is setuid root (as is the case in some distributions), the vulnerability can be exploited to gain local root privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious NTFS Image:** An attacker can craft a malicious NTFS image file with a specially crafted USA within an MFT record.
- **Physical Access:** An attacker with physical access to a computer can plug in an external storage device containing the malicious NTFS image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs either local access to the system or physical access to an external port where a vulnerable ntfs-3g process runs upon device insertion.
- **NTFS Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand the structure of NTFS metadata, specifically the MFT record and the update sequence array.

**Additional Notes:**

- The `ntfsck` tool is used in some GNU/Linux distributions (e.g., Fedora as `fsck.ntfs`), even though it is marked as quarantined by the vendor.
- The vulnerability was reported to Tuxera on 2021-09-24 with no response.
- The issue was fixed in ntfs-3g version 2022.5.17.
- The fix involved checking if `assert_u32_equal` failed, and exit if so, preventing further out-of-bounds write operations.
- The vulnerability is considered moderate severity.
