Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the reported issue:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a segmentation fault (SEGV) occurring within the `mjs` executable when processing a specific JavaScript code snippet. The crash occurs during a WRITE memory access at an unknown address. The specific instruction causing the crash is located at offset `0x8814e` within the `mjs` executable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption leading to a segmentation fault. The `AddressSanitizer` output indicates a write to an invalid memory location.
- The `poc.js` code uses string manipulation with `JSON.stringify` on the type of the print function, which somehow triggers the vulnerability. This suggests that an unexpected code path is reached or that specific inputs lead to the memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The immediate impact is a crash of the `mjs` executable, leading to a denial of service. Repeated exploitation could prevent the affected application or system from functioning correctly.
- Potential for further exploitation: While the current report only details a crash, a more thorough investigation might find it possible to overwrite memory and lead to more serious consequences like code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the execution of a specially crafted JavaScript file. In this specific instance, the `poc.js` file triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted JavaScript file to be processed by the vulnerable version of `mjs`. This could be an attacker with file system access or an ability to trigger the `mjs` executable with a crafted input file.
- The attacker must be able to execute this file using the vulnerable mjs binary

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was discovered by the OWL337 team.
- The issue occurs in a specific build environment (Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS with Linux 5.4.0-44-generic x86_64).
- The `mjs` commit hash where this vulnerability is present is `b1b6eac6b1e5b830a5cb14f8f4dc690ef3162551`.
- The AddressSanitizer provides limited details as it can't provide additional information on what is happening.

It's worth noting that the provided information is specific to a crash report. More information such as the vulnerable source code would be required to understand why this particular javascript snippet causes memory corruption
