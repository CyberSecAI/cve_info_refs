Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46452:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a command injection vulnerability present in the `SetNetworkTomographySettings` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system through the vulnerable function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device. This could lead to a variety of impacts including, but not limited to:
    *   Complete device compromise.
    *   Data exfiltration or manipulation.
    *   Denial of Service.
    *   Further network compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is LAN-side, meaning an attacker needs to have network access to the local network where the vulnerable device is connected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be on the same local network as the affected D-Link DIR-823-Pro router.
*   The attacker must be able to send network requests that would reach the vulnerable `SetNetworkTomographySettings` function.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided information mentions that this vulnerability is one of multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-46452 through CVE-2021-46457) found in the D-Link DIR-823-Pro router with Hardware Revision Ax and Firmware version v1.0.2.
*   The vendor recommends that users of the affected device should retire and replace it as the device is considered End-of-Life/End-of-Service (EOL/EOS) and no firmware updates are provided.
*   The vulnerability was reported by a 3rd party security researcher and publicly disclosed before a patch was available, which is discouraged by the vendor.
