Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified SQL injection vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `/mdiy/dict/list` route of the MCMS application. The `orderBy` parameter from the request is directly concatenated into an SQL query without any sanitization or proper escaping.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The most prominent vulnerability is SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization.
    *   **Direct SQL Query Construction:** The application directly constructs SQL queries by concatenating user-supplied input, which is a common anti-pattern leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Data Breach:** A successful SQL injection attack can allow an attacker to access sensitive data stored in the database.
    *   **Data Modification:** Attackers could modify or delete data from the database.
    *   **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database user's permissions, an attacker might be able to escalate privileges within the database or even the operating system.
    *   **Application compromise:** It could be possible to compromise the application's integrity by injecting malicious queries.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the `orderBy` parameter in an HTTP request to the `/mdiy/dict/list` endpoint.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application endpoint (`/mdiy/dict/list`).
    *   **Basic Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs some understanding of SQL to craft malicious SQL injection payloads.
    *   **No authentication required (Front-end vulnerability):** The issue description mentions that this is a front-end vulnerability.
