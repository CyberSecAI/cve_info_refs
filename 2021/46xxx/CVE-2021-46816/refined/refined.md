- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  A memory access vulnerability where the application attempts to access a memory location beyond the bounds of a buffer. This is identified as CWE-788.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs local access to the system. The attack requires user interaction (UI:R). The exploit does not require any privileges (PR:N)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system, and requires user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.
