### **[zeha](/zeha)** commented [Aug 4, 2021](#issue-960816974)

| What I Did We have noticed a disclosure of memory contents from mod\_radius to RADIUS servers.  mod\_radius copies the client-supplied password into a temporary buffer to encrypt it with the RADIUS shared secret. However, it does so obeying some padding rules: i.e. it is expected that the password has a length multiple of 16.  If the password length is *not* an exact multiple, mod\_radius still copies the "rounded up" count of bytes from the password buffer into the temporary buffer, thereby leaking whatever happens to occur past the actual password. For FTP session, this often seems to be a copy of the password, preceded by some 0 bytes, and tailed by some garbage. We have not evaluated if SFTP sessions may leak other secrets.  This can be reproduced very well with very short passwords. From a FreeRADIUS radiusd debug log, you can observe the duplication of the password "12345" here:  (0) Received Access-Request Id 94 from 10.12.16.61:24712 to 10.12.16.26:1812 length 133 (0) User-Name = "test@realm.ch" (0) User-Password = "012345\000\000012345\000d" (0) NAS-Identifier = "ftp" (0) NAS-IP-Address = 10.12.16.61 (0) NAS-Port = 21 (0) NAS-Port-Type = Virtual What I Expected/Wanted proftpd should send *just* the user password, and nothing else. ProFTPD Version and Configuration I've specifically tested this with 1.3.3c (from source), 1.3.6-4+deb10u5 (from Debian) and git [cba3a1a](https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/commit/cba3a1aaaa264e2926fea16c7d9cef4fa8f6e323). |

# ProFTPd: Memory Disclosure — GLSA **202305-03**

A vulnerability has been discovered in ProFTPd which could result in memory disclosure.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-ftp/proftpd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.3.7c** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.7c** |

### Background

ProFTPD is an advanced and very configurable FTP server.

### Description

ProFTPd unconditionally sends passwords to Radius servers for authentication in multiples of 16 bytes. If a password is not of a length that is a multiple of 16 bytes, ProFTPd will read beyond the end of the password string and send bytes beyond the end of the string buffer.

### Impact

Radius servers used for authentication can receive the contents of the ProFTPd process' memory.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ProFTPd users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-ftp/proftpd-1.3.7c"

```

 1.3.7 Release Notes
------------------------
This file contains a description of the major changes to ProFTPD for the
1.3.7 release cycle, from the 1.3.7rc1 release to the 1.3.7 maintenance
releases. More information on these changes can be found in the NEWS and
ChangeLog files.
1.3.7e
---------
+ Ensure that mod\_sftp algorithms work properly when OpenSSL 3.x is used.
1.3.7d
---------
+ Improved consistency/support for name-based virtual hosts.
+ Fixed crashes due to very long lines in AuthGroupFiles (Issue #1321).
1.3.7c
---------
+ Fix memory disclosure to RADIUS servers by mod\_radius (Issue #1284).
+ PCRE expressions with capture groups were not being handled properly
(Issue #1300).
1.3.7b
---------
+ Fixed occasional segfaults with FTPS data transfers using TLSv1.3, when
session tickets cannot be decrypted (Issue #1063).
+ Passive transfers fail unexpectedly due to use of SO\_REUSEPORT socket
option (Issue #1171).
+ Implemented support for Redis 6.x AUTH semantics (Issue #1070).
+ Fixed memory use-after-free issue in mod\_sftp which can cause unexpected
login/authentication issues.
+ Fixed SQL syntax regression for some generated SQL statements
(Issue #1149).
+ Fixed "Corrupted MAC on inptut" errors when SFTP uses the
umac-64@openssh.com digest (Issue #1111).
1.3.7a
---------
+ Fix build-time regression when using the --localstatedir configure option.
1.3.7
---------
+ Support the SOURCE\_DATE\_EPOCH environment variable, for reproducible
builds (Issue #1038).
1.3.7rc4
---------
+ Implemented support for configuring certificate options for LDAP
connections using SSL/TLS.
+ Fixed issue with FTPS uploads of large files using TLSv1.3 (Issue #959).
+ Fixed handling of IPv6 addresses in From directives (Issue #682).
+ Added -b and -n command-line options to ftptop.
+ Ignore supplemental groups when run as non-root user (Issue #808).
+ Use re-entrant versions of time functions where available (Issue #983).
+ New Configuration Directives
BanOptions
The BanOptions directive is used to tune mod\_ban behavior, such as
creating ban entries that match/apply to all  sections.
See doc/contrib/mod\_ban.html#BanOptions for more details.
LDAPUseSASL
The LDAPUseSASL directive configures a list of SASL authentication
mechanisms to use, when using the LDAPBindDN to bind to the LDAP
server. See doc/contrib/mod\_ldap.html#LDAPUseSASL for details.
LogOptions
The LogOptions directive is used to modify the default logging format
for ProFTPD syslog, debug, and module logging. See
doc/modules/mod\_log.html#LogOptions for more information.
SQLKeepAlive
The SQLKeepAlive directive configures a periodic "keepalive" query
for ensuring the connection between mod\_sql and the backend database
server. See doc/contrib/mod\_sql.html#SQLKeepAlive for more information.
+ Changed Configuration Directives
LDAPServer
The LDAPServer directive now supports configuring the trusted CA
file, client certificate and key files, SSL ciphers, and verification
policies for LDAP connections. See doc/contrib/mod\_ldap.html#LDAPServer
for more details.
TraceOptions
The TraceOptions directive now supports a "Timestamp" option, for
disabling inclusion of timestamps in Trace logs.
+ Developer notes
When MaxLoginAttempts is reach, the POST\_CMD\_ERR/LOG\_CMD\_ERR command
handler phases will now run. This allows interested modules, such
as mod\_exec and others, to react to these events (Issue #718).
1.3.7rc3
---------
+ Fixed regression in directory listing latency (Issue #863).
+ Fixed use-after-free vulnerability during data transfers (Issue #903).
+ Addressed out-of-bounds read in mod\_cap by removing bundled libcap, and
relying solely on the system-provided libcap (Issue #902). Note that
building ProFTPD from source will \*not\* automatically include the
mod\_cap module, unless the libcap library is available.
+ mod\_sftp now supports OpenSSH-specific private host keys (Issue #793).
Newer versions of OpenSSH ssh-keygen(1) automatically generate private
keys formatted with this OpenSSH-specific format.
+ mod\_sftp now supports Ed25519 keys (Bug #4221).
+ mod\_sftp now supports RSA SHA-2 publickey signatures, per RFC 8332
(Issue #907).
+ mod\_tls now honors client-provided SNI as part of the TLS handshake,
for implementing name-based virtual hosts via TLS SNI.
+ Changed Configuration Directives
LogFormat %{transfer-port}
The LogFormat directive supports a %{transfer-port} variable for
logging the selected data transfer port.
SFTPOptions NoExtensionNegotiation
The mod\_sftp module now supports SSH extension negotations (RFC 8332).
If there any issues with this support, it can be disabled using:
SFTPOptions NoExtensionNegotiation
SQLAuthTypes bcrypt
The mod\_sql\_passwd module now supports bcrypt-encrypted passwords.
This can be enabled using:
SQLAuthTypes bcrypt
in your mod\_sql configuration. See doc/contrib/mod\_sql\_password.html
for more information.
TLSOption IgnoreSNI
The TLSOption directive now supports an "IgnoreSNI" setting, to
tell mod\_tls to ignore/not use any SNI, provided by the client in the
TLS handshake, for determining any name-based virtual hosts. See
doc/contrib/mod\_tls.html#TLSOption for more details.
+ Added API
FSIO pread(2), pwrite(2) (Issue#317)
1.3.7rc2
---------
+ Fixed pre-authentication remote denial-of-service issue (Issue #846,
CVE-2019-18217).
1.3.7rc1
---------
+ RootRevoke is now on by default, meaning that once authentication succeeds,
all root privileges are dropped by default, unless the UserOwner directive
(which requires root privileges) is used (Bug#4241).
+ The mod\_ident module is no longer automatically built by default.
To include the mod\_ident module in the build, it must be explicitly
requested via --enable-ident or --with-shared=mod\_ident.
This means that configuration files using the IdentLookups directive
will now want to using an enclosing  section, like so:
IdentLookups off

+ The mod\_tls module now performs basic sanity checks of configured TLS
files on startup (Issue#491).
+ The mod\_deflate module now supports MODE Z data transfers when TLS
is used (Issue#505).
+ The mod\_xfer module now supports the RANG FTP command; see
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bryan-ftp-range-08 (Issue#351).
+ The ftpasswd script now supports a --change-home option, for changing
the home directory of a user in an AuthUserFile (Issue#566).
+ The ftpasswd script supports deleting a user from a group (Issue#620).
+ Refactored the LogFormat handling code so that it is not longer
duplicated by mod\_log, mod\_sql, etc. The new Jot API is the common API
to be used by modules for LogFormat variables and logging.
+ Generated new DH parameters for mod\_sftp, mod\_tls.
+ New Configuration Directives
AuthFileOptions
The mod\_auth\_file module supports a configuration directive for disabling
its requirement for secure permissions on configured
AuthUserFile/AuthGroupFile. See
doc/modules/mod\_auth\_file.html#AuthFileOptions for information.
RedisLogOnEvent
The mod\_redis module can be configured to log JSON messages based on
specified events (Issue#392). See the
doc/modules/mod\_redis.html#RedisLogOnEvent documentation for details.
RedisOptions
The mod\_redis module now implements a RedisOptions directive, for tuning
some of the module behavior (Issue#477). The
doc/modules/mod\_redis.html#RedisOptions documentation has more details.
RedisSentinel
The mod\_redis module now supports use of Redis Sentinels (Issue#396);
see doc/modules/mod\_redis.html#RedisSentinel.
+ Changed Configuration Directives
AllowForeignAddress class-name
The AllowForeignAddress directive supports a Class name, for finer-grained
control over which clients are allowed to use foreign/mismatching IP
addresses for transfers. See
doc/modules/mod\_core.html#AllowForeignAddress for more information.
ExecEnviron %b
The ExecEnviron directive has been fixed to properly resolve the %b
LogFormat variable (Issue#515).
RedisServer db-index (Issue#550)
The mod\_redis module can now be configured to select a database index
via the RedisServer directive (Issue#550). See the
doc/modules/mod\_redis.html#RedisServer documentation for details.
RewriteMap idnatrans
The mod\_rewrite module can now support rewriting `idn` to `idna`
formats (Issue#231). See the doc/modules/mod\_rewrite#RewriteMap for
details on how to do so.
RootRevoke on
The RootRevoke directive is now enabled by default (Bug#4241). This
makes for more secure configurations/sessions out-of-the-box. See
doc/modules/mod\_auth.html#RootRevoke for more information.
SFTPCiphers, SFTPDigests
Some weak algorithms are now disabled by default in mod\_sftp (Bug#4279).
These algorithms, if need be, can be explicitly enabled by configuration;
they are just not enabled automatically. For list of the algorithms
affected, see doc/contrib/mod\_sftp.html#SFTPCiphers,
doc/contrib/mod\_sftp.html#SFTPDigests.
SFTPOptions IncludeSFTPTimes
The SFTOptions directive of mod\_sftp now supports an option for explicitly
including the timestamps of files when SFTP protocol 4 and higher are
used, even if the SFTP client did not request these timestamps. This
works around a bug in the popular Rebex SFTP library; see
doc/contrib/mod\_sftp.html#SFTPOptions for details.
TLSProtocol TLSv1.3
The mod\_tls module, and its TLSProtocol directive, now support TLSv1.3
(Issue#536). See doc/contrib/mod\_tls.html#TLSProtocol for more
information.
TLSServerCipherPreference
The TLSServerCipherPreference directive is now enabled by default.
See doc/contrib/mod\_tls.html#TLSServerCipherPrefrence.
TLSStaplingOptions NoFakeTryLater
Some TLS clients have trouble with the "fake" OCSP response that mod\_tls
might stable, when the client requested stapled OCSP responses and
mod\_tls is unable to contact the OCSP responder. Use this option to
disable such fake responses (Issue#518):
TLSStaplingOptions NoFakeTryLater
See doc/contrib/mod\_tls.html#TLSStaplingOptions for details.
+ Removed Configuration Directives
The following directives have been removed:
GroupPassword
LoginPasswordPrompt
TransferPriority
