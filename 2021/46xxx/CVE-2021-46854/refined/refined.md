Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-46854:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `mod_radius` module of ProFTPD. When authenticating users against a RADIUS server, `mod_radius` copies the client-provided password into a temporary buffer before encryption with the RADIUS shared secret.
- The module expects the password length to be a multiple of 16 bytes. If the password is not an exact multiple of 16, `mod_radius` copies a rounded-up number of bytes, leading to reading and copying data beyond the end of the actual password buffer into the temporary buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the out-of-bounds read. `mod_radius` reads beyond the allocated buffer for the password, copying extra memory.
- **Padding issues:** The code does not properly handle password strings that are not multiples of 16 bytes, resulting in the leakage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** The primary impact is the disclosure of memory contents to the RADIUS server. This leaked memory may contain sensitive data, such as the user's password itself (often duplicated), possibly other session-related secrets, and garbage data from the process's memory.
- **Exposure of Secrets:** Leaking process memory can potentially reveal other confidential information that may be stored in adjacent memory locations. While the provided examples show password duplication and some garbage data, the content of leaked memory might vary depending on the environment and context of the program.
- **Unintended Data Transmission:** The RADIUS server receives more data than it should, which could be exploited for further attacks depending on the capabilities of the RADIUS server's processing of the data received.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `mod_radius` module during user authentication. Specifically, when a user attempts to authenticate against a ProFTPD server configured to use RADIUS authentication, and their password length is not a multiple of 16.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication Attempt:** An attacker needs to initiate an authentication attempt on a ProFTPD server using RADIUS authentication. They would need to be in a position to send an FTP login request to the ProFTPD server.
- **Knowledge of RADIUS Configuration:** They do not need to know anything about the RADIUS shared secret, or any other sensitive data.
- **Password Manipulation:** The attacker would need to be able to manipulate the password's length, ensuring it is not a multiple of 16. This can be achieved by simply providing a password with a length that does not meet the multiple of 16 requirement.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in ProFTPD version 1.3.7c and later.
- The issue is related to how `mod_radius` handles password padding before sending the data to the RADIUS server.
-  The vulnerability was initially reported in issue #1284 and fixed in pull request #1285 in the proftpd github repo.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 202305-03 addresses this vulnerability.
