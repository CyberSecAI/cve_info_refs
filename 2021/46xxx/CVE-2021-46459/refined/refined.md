The provided content includes information about CVE-2021-46459.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the Victor CMS application. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize user input provided via POST request parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities are present in the `admin/users.php?source=add_user` component. These vulnerabilities are triggered by the `user_name`, `user_firstname`, `user_lastname`, and `user_email` parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted POST requests to the vulnerable `admin/users.php?source=add_user` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint with malicious SQL payloads in the `user_name`, `user_firstname`, `user_lastname`, or `user_email` parameters. The attacker likely needs to have access to the admin panel.
