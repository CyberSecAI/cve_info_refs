- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `tab` parameter before outputting it in an attribute within the admin dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable page, which will be executed by the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL containing a JavaScript payload within the `tab` parameter and tricking an administrator into visiting it. The vulnerable URL is located in the WordPress admin dashboard.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to convince a logged-in administrator to visit the crafted malicious URL.
