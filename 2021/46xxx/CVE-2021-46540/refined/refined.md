Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the GitHub issue:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a segmentation fault (SEGV) occurring within the `mjs_get_mjs` function at `src/mjs_builtin.c:105`. This is triggered when the mjs engine processes a specific javascript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption: The crash indicates a memory safety issue within the mjs JavaScript engine.  The AddressSanitizer output specifically points to a "WRITE memory access" causing the SEGV, implying a write to an invalid memory location.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: The immediate impact is a crash (segmentation fault) leading to denial of service for the mjs engine. This could halt the execution of applications using this engine.
- Potential for more severe consequences: While the immediate impact is a crash, the underlying memory corruption vulnerability could potentially be exploited for more severe consequences such as arbitrary code execution, if a carefully crafted input is provided and can bypass ASan.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious JavaScript: The vulnerability is triggered via malicious or crafted JavaScript code that exploits a flaw in the number conversion to string handling.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide malicious Javascript code: The attacker would need to be able to pass the specific javascript code (`print--(+""); print(+"\n\n");`) to be executed by a mjs instance.

**More detail than the CVE description:**
- The provided content provides the exact code that triggers the vulnerability and the location of the crash. The vulnerability occurs within the `mjs_get_mjs` function at `src/mjs_builtin.c:105`. The ASAN log shows a write to a bad address.

- The code that triggers the vulnerability is:
```javascript
print--(+"");
print(+"\n\n");
```
This code when run by the mjs engine causes a crash.
