Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46163:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is the improper handling of XML documents within the Media Libraries subsystem of Kentico Xperience CMS. This allows for the injection of malicious code through specially crafted XML files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, specifically a stored XSS. This arises because the system fails to sanitize the XML content uploaded to the media library before rendering it.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they access a malicious XML file in the media library. This can lead to various impacts:
*   **Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary javascript code within the user's browser
*   **Data Theft:** Stealing sensitive information such as cookies, session tokens or user data.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Impersonating a logged-in user
*   **Website Defacement:** Altering the appearance or behavior of the website for other users.
*   **Phishing Attacks:** Redirecting users to malicious websites

4.  **Trigger XSS:**  Clicking the link file, which renders the malicious XML in the browser, executes the XSS payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker requires the ability to upload files to the media library.
*   The attacker needs to trick another user into clicking the malicious XML file

**Additional Information:**
*   The affected version is Kentico Xperience CMS v13.0.44.
*   The vulnerability is located in the Media Libraries component.
*   The vulnerability is confirmed by the vendor (Kentico).
