  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2021-46872",
    "description": "The provided text describes a fix for a potential 'javascript:' protocol exploit in the Nim programming language's documentation generator. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code through specially crafted links within the documentation.",
    "affected_component": "Nim's documentation generator (rstgen.nim)",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of URLs in the documentation generator. Specifically, the `renderImage` and `renderHyperlink` functions did not adequately check for potentially harmful protocols like `javascript:`, allowing them to be included in generated HTML.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Sanitization",
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of users viewing the generated documentation. This could lead to a variety of malicious actions, such as stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing other client-side attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted reStructuredText (RST) or Markdown documents containing malicious URLs with `javascript:` protocol.",
      "Directly injecting the malicous javascript code in generated HTML if that's possible."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to create or modify RST/Markdown content that is processed by the vulnerable version of Nim's documentation generator. This could involve submitting malicious documentation, manipulating user-generated content, or exploiting other means of controlling the documentation content.",
    "fixed_in_versions": "The fix was implemented in the commit `46275126b89218e64844eee169e8ced05dd0e2d7` and included in Nim version 1.6.2 and backported to 1.0 branch.",
        "mitigation": "The vulnerability was mitigated by implementing a `safeProtocol` function that checks if the URL protocol is one of `http`, `https` or `ftp` otherwise it makes the link an empty string. This function was called within `renderImage` and `renderHyperlink` to sanitize the URLs before including them in generated HTML."
