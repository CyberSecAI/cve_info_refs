Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46279:

**Vulnerability:** CVE-2021-46279 - Session Fixation and Insufficient Session Expiration

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from the BMC web application's handling of user sessions. Specifically, it suffers from session fixation, which occurs when a session identifier is reused, and insufficient session expiration, meaning that sessions remain valid longer than intended.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Session Fixation:** The application does not properly invalidate or regenerate session IDs after a user authenticates, allowing an attacker to potentially hijack existing sessions.
    *   **Insufficient Session Expiration:** The session expiration mechanism is not correctly implemented, which means that sessions remain active longer than they should, potentially allowing attackers to access authenticated sessions.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to a user's session. The impact is rated as having low confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack involves a user being tricked into using a crafted session ID that is controlled by the attacker. The attacker then uses the session ID to gain access to the user's account.
    *   The application is accessible via the network.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to trick a user into using a crafted session ID (User Interaction is required)
    *   The attacker must be able to interact with the BMC web application to hijack the session after the user has logged in.
    *  The attack can be carried out remotely.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerable component is the web interface of the Lanner IAC-AST2500A, which uses American Megatrends (AMI) MegaRAC SP-X firmware.
*   The vulnerability is present in version 1.10.0 of the standard firmware of Lanner IAC-AST2500.
*   The article provides a broader context of multiple vulnerabilities found during security research on BMC firmware.
