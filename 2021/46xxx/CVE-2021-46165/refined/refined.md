The provided content describes vulnerabilities in the Reports module of ManageEngine Endpoint Central and their fixes. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

1.  **RCE via Reports Module:** The Reports module allowed users with full access to execute commands, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
2.  **File Path Error:** An error related to file paths occurred during the product startup.
3.  **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Users with access to the Reports page were able to view sensitive database data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** Users with full access to the Reports module had privileges that allowed them to execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Improper File Path Handling:**  An error related to file path during the product startup
*   **Lack of Data Sanitization/Access Restriction:**  Sensitive database information was accessible through the Reports interface

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers could execute arbitrary code on the server by exploiting the commands permitted within the reports module.
*   **Potential System Compromise:** RCE can lead to complete control over the affected system.
*   **Data Breach:** Sensitive database information could be accessed and potentially stolen.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Abuse of Reports Module:** A malicious user with full access to the Reports module could inject and execute malicious commands.
*   **Web Interface Access:** Exploitation is possible via the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** Attackers needed to have an account with full access to the Reports module to exploit the RCE vulnerability.
*   **Web Interface Access:** The attacker needs access to the web interface of Endpoint Central.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerabilities were fixed in Endpoint Central build 10.0.662, released on 03-May-2021.
* The fix involved downgrading the access level for the Reports module to "Read-Only".
* An executable file from the batch files with a properly defined path is invoked when the Endpoint Central server is started or stopped to fix file path issue.
* Access to sensitive tables in the database has been restricted.
*  The vulnerability is not applicable to the cloud edition of Endpoint Central.
