Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46461:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a missing element in the `typeof` table within the `njs` (Nginx JavaScript) module when dealing with `DataView` objects. This leads to an out-of-bounds array access when the `typeof` operator is used on a `DataView` object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** Specifically, an out-of-bounds read occurs during the `njs_vmcode_typeof` function when it attempts to determine the type of a `DataView` object. The code tries to access an array using the object type as an index, but the `DataView` type is not included in the types array.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds access causes a segmentation fault (SEGV), leading to a crash of the NGINX worker process. This can result in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when JavaScript code running within the NGINX environment uses the `typeof` operator on a `DataView` object.
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the vulnerability. It involves creating an `ArrayBuffer`, creating a `DataView` from it and then attempting to get the type using the typeof operator.
```javascript
function main() {
    const v2 = new ArrayBuffer();
    const v3 = new DataView(v2);
    const v5 = typeof v3;
}
main();
```
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within the context of NGINX's njs module. This could be achieved via access to a service running NGINX with njs enabled or possibly by exploiting other vulnerabilities that lead to code execution.

**Additional Information:**
- The issue was identified and fixed by a patch that added the missing `DataView` type to the `typeof` table.
- The issue was assigned CVE-2021-46461 and has a CVSS score of 9.8 (CRITICAL).
- NetApp products that incorporate NGINX with the vulnerable njs version (<=0.7.1) are affected.  The NetApp advisory states that the Cloud Backup OST Plug-in (formerly AltaVault OST Plug-in) is affected.
- The vulnerability was fixed in njs version 0.7.1.
