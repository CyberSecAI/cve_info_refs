Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46853:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the Alpine email client handles responses from an IMAP server before the STARTTLS handshake is completed. Specifically, it was found that Alpine accepted untagged responses during this pre-STARTTLS phase. Additionally, sending LIST or LSUB commands before STARTTLS could lead to a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Accepting untagged responses before STARTTLS:** The client processes untagged IMAP responses before the TLS connection is established, which is insecure.
*   **Crash on LIST/LSUB before STARTTLS:** Sending specific IMAP commands (LIST or LSUB) before the STARTTLS command could cause the Alpine client to crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of service:** A malicious server or MitM attacker can send crafted untagged responses or specific commands before STARTTLS to crash the Alpine email client, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Information Leak:** While not directly stated for this CVE, the acceptance of untagged responses before STARTTLS could potentially expose the client to other attacks where a malicious server might be able to inject data into the connection before it is properly secured.  (Note: other CVEs associated with this family of vulnerabilities, e.g. CVE-2021-38370, allow for command injection).

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack:** An attacker intercepts the connection between the client and the server and manipulates responses.
*   **Malicious server:** A compromised or malicious IMAP server sends crafted responses or commands to the client.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **MitM:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify network traffic between the email client and server.
*   **Malicious server:** The attacker needs control over the IMAP server.
*   **Network Access:** Ability to interact with the target client over a network.

**Additional details:**

*   The issue was present in Alpine versions prior to 2.25 and was fixed in version 2.25
*   The vulnerability is related to a broader class of STARTTLS vulnerabilities detailed on the `nostarttls.secvuln.info` website, which highlights several issues with STARTTLS implementations in email clients and servers.
*  The vulnerability was discovered as part of a larger research effort on STARTTLS security.
*   The fix was implemented in commit `e58edb33f71687cb0b12c10a6cea2db2f8a35011`
*   The CVE was requested after the initial report of the vulnerability, and it was initially mischaracterized by MITRE, prompting a correction request from the discoverer of the vulnerability.
