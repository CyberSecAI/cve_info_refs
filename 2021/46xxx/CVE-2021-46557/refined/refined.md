Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2021-46557 (as indicated in the repository description)
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the Vicidial application's script tab. Specifically, the application fails to properly filter or encode user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The injected script is stored in the database and executed when other users access the affected script in the application.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, including:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Stealing sensitive information (e.g., cookies, login credentials).
    *   Defacement of the application.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the Vicidial administration interface, specifically the script tab input. An attacker with sufficient privileges to access and modify scripts can inject malicious JavaScript code into the script tab inputs.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker requires valid credentials or the ability to create a user with necessary permissions to access and modify scripts in the Vicidial admin panel and access the `/admin.php?ADD=1111111` page.

**Additional Details:**
* The provided exploit code `<scr<script>alert(1)</script>ipt>alert<script>alert(1)</script>(1)</scr<script>alert(1)</script>ipt>` demonstrates the filter bypass. It looks like the application is removing `<script>` tags, and using a nested script tag circumvents the filter.
