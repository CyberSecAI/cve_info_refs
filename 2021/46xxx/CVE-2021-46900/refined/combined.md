# 2021-001 Inappropriate use of the `cookie` parameter

The Sympa Community
2023-12-31 (Update)

## Synopsis

Inappropriate use of the `cookie` parameter can be a security threat.
This parameter may also not provide sufficient security.

## Systems Affected

* All versions of Sympa prior to 6.2.62.

## Problem Description

Earlier versions of Sympa require a parameter named "`cookie`" in
`sympa.conf` configuration file.

This parameter was used to make some identifiers generated by the
system unpredictable. For example, it was used as following:

* To be used as a salt to encrypt passwords stored in the database by the
  RC4 symmetric key algorithm.

  Note that RC4 is no longer considered secure enough and is not supported
  in the current version of Sympa.
* To prevent attackers from sending crafted messages to achieve XSS and so
  on in message archives.

There were the following problems with the use of this parameter.

1. This parameter, for its purpose, should be different for each installation,
   and once set, it cannot be changed.
   As a result, some sites have been operating without setting this parameter.
   This completely invalidates the security measures described above.
2. Even if this parameter is properly set, it may be considered not being
   strong enough against brute force attacks.

For the above reasons, administrators are recommended to take the measures
detailed below.

## Impact

Attacker can achieve XSS and so on in message archives.

## Workarounds

If you are operating without setting the `cookie` parameter and you cannot
upgrade to the latest version of Sympa right now, set a value for this
parameter to mitigate security risks.

However, if you are using 6.2.40 or earlier, you need to upgrade your
RC4-encrypted passwords by running `upgrade_sympa_password.pl` (with
6.2.16 or later) or `sympa.pl --md5_encode_password` (earlier) before
setting this parameter.

Note that, when you set this parameter, you have to restart the
all of the services for Sympa you are running (Sympa services, WWSympa,
Sympa SOAP service).

## Solution

The best solution is to upgrade to Sympa 6.2.62 or later which no longer uses
the `cookie` parameter.

Check "[Upgrading Sympa](https://sympa-community.github.io/manual/upgrade.html)"
in the Administration Manual for upgrading instruction.

| Expected Behavior `cookie` parameter will be obsoleted. Possible Solution  * Modify codes that are using cookie parameter appropriately. * Update documentation.  Context As far as I investigated with current stable (6.2.60), `cookie` parameter is used *at least* in these things:   * bin/upgrade\_send\_spool.pl#sympa\_checksum()   to migrate older bulk spool   This is needed for upgrading from versions prior to 6.2. * bin/upgrade\_sympa\_password.pl#\_decrypt\_rc4\_password()   to migrate older user password   This is needed for upgrading from versions prior to 6.2.26 by which RC4 encryption was deprecated. * Sympa::Tools::Password#tmp\_passwd()   to create temporary password for new users;   This process should be removed after careful review. * Sympa::Archive#\_get\_tag()   to generate randomized tags for `$tag$` notation in `mhonarc_ressources.tt2`   This process should be removed by adopting another randomization. * Sympa::List.pm#get\_cookie()   to get List's (not the default in sympa.conf) `cookie` parameter   This function is no longer used. |

| It's nice idea to give up direct upgrade from 6.1. (You might mean of Debian packages.)  I think `sympa.pl --upgrade` would be better to stop processing when `sympa.conf` contains backtick. By this, the sites not using this syntax will be upgraded safely. |

[@racke](https://github.com/racke): I don't think simply dropping upgrade from versions prior to 6.1 is such a good idea. From my experience, People tend to operate their Sympa during a long time before upgrading, because as long as it makes the job, they don't bother upgrading. And when they decide to do it, what's nice with Sympa is that the whole history of sympa upgrade operations is handled by `sympa.pl --upgrade` and a handful of scripts. This simplifies making people move to the new version.  I think sympa.pl --upgrade would be better to stop processing when sympa.conf contains backtick.

There is no straightforward upgrade from 6.1 any way in my opinion. |

However, currently administrators can upgrade from 6.1.x by intervening manually according to [Upgrading notes](https://sympa-community.github.io/manual/upgrade/notes.html). --- In fact, recently some administrators posted questions about this process.  We may drop support for releases prior to 6.2.xx (Of course I agree). This means that we won't provide more fixes for these earlier versions, but *doesn't* mean that we will stop providing measure to upgradse from earlier versions. |

| we did lots of incompatible changes since then.  Certainly but the upgrade takes care of the incompatible changes. Listen, I agree on the removal of useless code but, on my opinion, anything used to upgrade from previous versions should not be considered useless.  Maybe we should create an issue about which version upgrade we support?  If old version upgrade is dropped, I'd be in favor of moving old upgrade code to contributions; This way, we get rid of old code and don't abandon old timers.  EDIT: rephrase. |

| No one with a sane mind would do the upgrade of an old Sympa production installation in place. You are going to start with a test system and run the upgrades until your satisfied with the result. So having to run multiple steps of upgrades is really insignificant compared to the whole progress.  That leaves us to decide which is the version we support with the sympa upgrade command. |

That leaves us to decide which is the version we support with the sympa upgrade command.  As [I wrote before](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/pull/1092#issuecomment-764535221), we may not worry about whether code for upgrading process really supports earlier versions.  Good night for now. |

| [@ikedas](https://github.com/ikedas) Can you please explain why it affects upgrading from 6.2.58?  It's you who tell "to retire direct upgrades from 6.1 to the latest 6.2 release". You also told user may upgrade "having to run multiple steps". I think these mean that users using earlier version must take the first step to upgrade to 6.2.60 (or later?), then the second step to the most recent version: Now the two versions with 6.2.60 in between are allowed to be discontinuous. Thus, anything that has been included in any version *prior to* 6.2.60 may be removed or changed on the future versions without notice or measures. --- That's why your proposal will also affect to users upgrading from 6.2.58. |

| [@racke](https://github.com/racke), though I haven't debugged, with the change like [a285918](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/commit/a2859184cbee3e8b4375a116a188ce1eb0daa76f), I think it is possible to both obsolete a parameter and to process upgrading using that obsoleted parameter. Even by such change, do we still have to remove these scripts? |

No, that is not my intention. I definitely want to select an early version of 6.2 to be upgradeable to 6.2 latest version and not 6.2.58. For example we choose 6.2.16. Users from 6.1 and 6.2 < 6.2.16 need to upgrade 6.2.16 first. Direct upgrades from 6.2.16 and newer will be supported for the foreseeable future. |

Users from 6.1 and 6.2 < 6.2.16 need to upgrade 6.2.16 first. Direct upgrades from 6.2.16 and newer will be supported for the foreseeable future.  As you know, all of earlier versions are [proven vulnerable](https://sympa-community.github.io/security/) and buggy. Only version we can recommend is always the latest version at that time. Thus, IMO we cannot recommend particular version of earlier 6.2.x as transient version.  # NB: Besides, assuming if you wanted to drop upgrading from earlier versions by getting rid of `upgrade_sympa_password.pl`, the version you could choose is not earlier than 6.2.28. See the initial post. However, why 6.2.28? This version is never slightly more stable than any other versions.  Anyway, recent some posts are not the discussion about "obsoleting 'cookie' parameter". I'm sorry but I'm going to exercise my authority so that we may save time for discussion which seems not having a quick conclusion:  **As the Release Manager, I don't allow removal of existing scripts and codes which will help upgrading from earlier versions, during my term, i.e. at least in this year.** (see also [a thread on discussion](https://github.com/orgs/sympa-community/teams/everyone/discussions/21)) |

## Description

Sympa before 6.2.62 relies on a cookie parameter for certain security objectives, but does not ensure that this parameter exists and has an unpredictable value. Specifically, the cookie parameter is both a salt for stored passwords and an XSS protection mechanism.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# 2021-001 Inappropriate use of the `cookie` parameter

The Sympa Community
2023-12-31 (Update)

## Synopsis

Inappropriate use of the `cookie` parameter can be a security threat.
This parameter may also not provide sufficient security.

## Systems Affected

* All versions of Sympa prior to 6.2.62.

## Problem Description

Earlier versions of Sympa require a parameter named "`cookie`" in
`sympa.conf` configuration file.

This parameter was used to make some identifiers generated by the
system unpredictable. For example, it was used as following:

* To be used as a salt to encrypt passwords stored in the database by the
  RC4 symmetric key algorithm.

  Note that RC4 is no longer considered secure enough and is not supported
  in the current version of Sympa.
* To prevent attackers from sending crafted messages to achieve XSS and so
  on in message archives.

There were the following problems with the use of this parameter.

1. This parameter, for its purpose, should be different for each installation,
   and once set, it cannot be changed.
   As a result, some sites have been operating without setting this parameter.
   This completely invalidates the security measures described above.
2. Even if this parameter is properly set, it may be considered not being
   strong enough against brute force attacks.

For the above reasons, administrators are recommended to take the measures
detailed below.

## Impact

Attacker can achieve XSS and so on in message archives.

## Workarounds

If you are operating without setting the `cookie` parameter and you cannot
upgrade to the latest version of Sympa right now, set a value for this
parameter to mitigate security risks.

However, if you are using 6.2.40 or earlier, you need to upgrade your
RC4-encrypted passwords by running `upgrade_sympa_password.pl` (with
6.2.16 or later) or `sympa.pl --md5_encode_password` (earlier) before
setting this parameter.

Note that, when you set this parameter, you have to restart the
all of the services for Sympa you are running (Sympa services, WWSympa,
Sympa SOAP service).

## Solution

The best solution is to upgrade to Sympa 6.2.62 or later which no longer uses
the `cookie` parameter.

Check "[Upgrading Sympa](https://sympa-community.github.io/manual/upgrade.html)"
in the Administration Manual for upgrading instruction.
