| Steps to reproduce the behavior:  1. Turn the drone on 2. Set the lower one byte to be greater than 0x75 except for the CRC of the MAVLINK PROTOCOL packet which is msgID 332 3. Send a packet set as a serial port to the drone. 4. BOF crash occurs.  example msgID332 packet 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 Describe the bug The lower 1 byte of MAVLINK PROTOCOL with msgID number 332 is "valid\_points". We can set "valid\_points" to a maximum of 0xff. BOF occurs in the source code line below when "valid\_points" is set to a large value. I found it in sitl mode and also checked it on the drone board. source code <https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/master/src/modules/mavlink/mavlink_receiver.cpp> PX4-Autopilot/src/modules/mavlink/mavlink\_receiver.cpp (line 1942 ~ line 1944) TEST board px4\_fmu-v5 nxp\_fmuk66-v3 log file page <https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=1b47a1c3-3afe-4518-9628-f3284d67fb41>  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91944211/136194771-81caae19-e6b9-4e1c-8e17-638caa6be6b2.png) |
