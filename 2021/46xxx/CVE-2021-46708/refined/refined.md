Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46708:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `swagger-ui-dist` Node.js package, specifically in versions prior to 4.1.3.
*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization or validation of the `url` parameter used to load remote OpenAPI definitions. This allows for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application makes requests to arbitrary URLs specified by the user through the `url` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially use the vulnerable application to make requests to internal network resources, which would otherwise be inaccessible from the outside, thus gaining access to sensitive information.
*   **Data Modification:** While not explicitly stated, SSRF can be used to modify resources, potentially through GET/POST requests to internal servers.
*   **Phishing Attacks:** By using the trusted names/domains of self-hosted instances, attackers can trick users into visiting malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable through the network by manipulating the `url` parameter in a request to a vulnerable `swagger-ui-dist` instance.
*   **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires a user to interact with the Swagger UI instance, typically by visiting a page where the vulnerable component is loaded, or being tricked into clicking on a malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable `swagger-ui-dist` instance.
*   The attacker does not require any prior authentication or privileges.
*   The attacker needs to craft a URL that exploits the `url` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is related to CVE-2018-25031, which has the same root cause, and affects the same package.
*   The Snyk vulnerability database identifies this vulnerability as `SNYK-JS-SWAGGERUIDIST-6056393`
*   The NetApp advisory indicates that multiple NetApp products incorporate Node.js, and that Swagger UI versions prior to 4.1.3 are susceptible to this vulnerability. However, the advisory also states that *none* of the listed NetApp products are affected by this vulnerability.
*   The fix is to upgrade `swagger-ui-dist` to version 4.1.3 or higher.
