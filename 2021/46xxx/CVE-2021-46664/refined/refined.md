Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-46664:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a missing check or incorrect handling of a NULL value in the `sub_select_postjoin_aggr` function within MariaDB. Specifically, the code does not properly handle a case where the `aggr` variable is NULL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **NULL Pointer Dereference:**  The primary issue is that the code attempts to dereference the `aggr` variable without ensuring it is not NULL, leading to a crash.
- **Assertion Failure**: The specific error is an assertion failure: `Assertion 'aggr != __null' failed in sub_select_postjoin_aggr`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of this vulnerability results in a server crash, leading to a denial of service.  This prevents legitimate users from accessing the database service.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious SQL Query:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted SQL query that results in a NULL `aggr` value within the `sub_select_postjoin_aggr` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Execute Queries:** An attacker needs to be able to execute SQL queries against a vulnerable MariaDB instance. This could be a user with some level of database access, or an attacker who has found a way to inject SQL through another vulnerability.
-   **No authentication needed** As per the NetApp advisory: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H` which indicates no privileges are needed.

**Technical Details:**

-   The vulnerability is located in the `sql/sql_select.cc` file according to the stack trace provided.
-   The issue affects `sub_select_postjoin_aggr` which occurs during processing a subquery.
-   The specific SQL statement that triggers the crash involves a `DELETE` statement with a subquery that uses a `UNION ALL` and a `SELECT DISTINCT` clause.
- The vulnerability is associated with the `MDEV-25761` ticket on MariaDB's Jira.

**Affected Versions (as found in the provided content):**

-   MariaDB versions through 10.5.9 are explicitly mentioned as vulnerable in the Fedora update notices and Jira ticket.
- NetApp advisory mentions versions prior to 10.2.41, 10.3.0 prior to 10.3.32, 10.4.0 prior to 10.4.22, 10.5.0 prior to 10.5.13, 10.6.0 prior to 10.6.5 are susceptible.
- The fix version was for versions 10.2.43, 10.3.34, 10.4.24, 10.5.15, 10.6.7 and 10.7.3

**Additional Notes:**

-   The provided `fuzz.sql` demonstrates a query that can trigger the vulnerability
-   The vulnerability was found using a fuzzing tool.
-   The fix is included in MariaDB version 10.5.15 and later, along with backports to older versions.
