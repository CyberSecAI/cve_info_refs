Intelligent solar power generation

## Higher yields for private homes

The Sunny Tripower 3.0–6.0 makes PV systems in private households especially powerful. It combines top inverter performance with maximum ease and comfort for its users. With integrated services and shade solutions, it can meet any challenge found on roofs. The Sunny Tripower reliably ensures maximum solar yields and reduces electricity costs.

## Quick and easy to install

Weighing only 17 kilograms, this three-phase Sunny Tripower can be installed quickly while taking up minimal space. The Sunny Tripower can be commissioned quickly via smartphone or tablet thanks to its integrated web interface.

* One-person installation due to low weight of 17 kg
* Compact design means minimum space requirements
* 100% plug and play installation
Intelligent optimization Flexibly expandable
## **Intelligent optimization of energy yield**

Established product features and integrated software solutions will provide yield optimization throughout the system’s entire service life. Even in shading. SMA ShadeFix is a proprietary inverter software that optimizes energy yield in nearly every situation. SMA Smart Connected inverter monitoring offers enhanced safety by detecting errors at an early stage and automatically reporting them to the installer.

* SMA ShadeFix is an integrated software for yield optimization
* Dynamic active power limitation means direct use of excess energy and less power from the grid
* Automatic inverter monitoring via SMA Smart Connected
* System data visualization via Sunny Portal
* Local visualization via Smart Inverter Screen
## **Flexibly expandable anytime**

With the Sunny Tripower, PV system operators and installers are always up to date. If greater use of solar power is made in your own home, intelligent energy management and SMA storage solutions can be added at any time to systems with the Sunny Tripower.

* Automatic inverter updates
* Intelligent energy management and storage solutions can be added anytime

SMA Smart Connected

## Investment security included

With SMA Smart Connected, SMA offers free and automatic inverter monitoring that helps installers to provide customers with a quick, targeted service. If an inverter fails, SMA proactively informs the PV system owner and the installer. In this way, PV system owners and installers benefit from minimized diagnosis and downtime. If it is necessary to replace the inverter, SMA sends a replacement device fast and free of charge.

SMA Smart Connected

## How it works

![](https://cdn.sma.de/fileadmin/content/website-meta/icons/svg/blue/50/settings-switches-checkmark.svg?v=1645801872)
### Activation of SMA Smart Connected

During registration of the system in Sunny Portal, you, as the installer, activate SMA Smart Connected and thus start automatic inverter monitoring by SMA.

![](https://cdn.sma.de/fileadmin/content/website-meta/icons/svg/blue/50/monitor-heart-beat-circle-notification.svg?v=1645801872)
### Automatic inverter monitoring

SMA automatically checks the inverter for anomalies around-the-clock during operation. You and your customers benefit from SMA's many years of experience.

![](https://cdn.sma.de/fileadmin/content/website-meta/icons/svg/blue/50/Messages__Chat-1.svg?v=1645801871)
### Proactive communication

After a fault has been diagnosed and analyzed, SMA informs the installer and PV system operator immediately by email. Everyone is thus optimally prepared for the troubleshooting process ensuring minimum downtimes and reducing outlay and costs. The regular power reports also provide the installer with valuable information about the overall system.

![](https://cdn.sma.de/fileadmin/content/website-meta/icons/svg/blue/50/conversion-exchange-checkmark.svg?v=1645801871)
### Replacement Service

If a replacement device is necessary, SMA automatically supplies a new inverter within one to three days of the fault diagnosis. As the installer, you can contact the PV system operator of your own accord and replace the inverter immediately.
