The provided content describes a vulnerability in MCMS, specifically related to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) and arbitrary file deletion.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application uses FreeMarker templates without proper security configurations, allowing for SSTI.
- The application allows a user to provide an `oldFileName` argument to a file deletion function which then deletes the file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** The use of FreeMarker templates without proper sanitization or sandboxing of user input allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the template.
2.  **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The application allows users to specify a filename and delete files on the server without proper access control.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1. **SSTI:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.
2.  **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker could delete critical system files, leading to system instability, denial of service, or data loss.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  **SSTI:** By inserting a malicious payload into the template management functionality through the backend system settings.
2. **Arbitrary File Deletion:** By providing a filename and `oldFileName` argument to a file deletion function. Specifically,  using the parameters `fileName` and `oldFileName` in a request to delete an arbitrary file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1. **SSTI:** The attacker needs to be logged into the back end system and have privileges to access the template management functionality.
2.  **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The attacker needs to have the ability to send requests to the server. It is implied that the attacker should be authenticated to use the file deletion function.
