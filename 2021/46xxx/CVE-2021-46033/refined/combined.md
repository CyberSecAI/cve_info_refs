| In this code, the verification suffix should verify the file type after the last point： public final String allowSuffix = ".bmp.jpg.jpeg.png.gif.pdf.doc.zip.rar.gz";  ``` /**  * 上传文件  *  * @param file  * @return  * @throws IOException  */ @RequestMapping(value = "/img", method = RequestMethod.POST) public JsonResult uploadFile(@RequestParam("file") MultipartFile file) {      //1.文件后缀过滤，只允许部分后缀     //文件的完整名称,如spring.jpeg     String filename = file.getOriginalFilename();     //文件名,如spring     String name = filename.substring(0, filename.indexOf("."));     //文件后缀,如.jpeg     String suffix = filename.substring(filename.lastIndexOf("."));      if (allowSuffix.indexOf(suffix) == -1) {         return new JsonResult().fail("不允许上传该后缀的文件！");     }  ```  example: [1640676827(1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92918668/147540850-f4c12247-cf64-4ed7-bd04-49a85af08ba7.jpg) [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92918668/147540903-b00edbe2-6267-4866-9dc4-7f0bc82f337a.png) |
