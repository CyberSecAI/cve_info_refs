Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2021-46331.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is that the `Proxy` implementation in Moddable-XS did not properly handle `NULL` target objects (e.g., a revoked proxy) in various code paths.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the insufficient checks for a valid target within the `Proxy` implementation, specifically when accessing the prototype of a revoked proxy.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a segmentation fault (SEGV), leading to a crash of the application. In the provided example, this results in the termination of the `xst` (Moddable-XS tool) process.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves using JavaScript code that utilizes `Proxy.revocable` to create a proxy and then revokes the proxy. Subsequently, accessing the prototype of the revoked proxy triggers the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to execute JavaScript code within the Moddable-XS environment to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs at `xs/sources/xsProxy.c:506` in the `fxProxyGetPrototype` function.
*   The provided test case demonstrates a reproducible crash.
*   The fix involves reviewing the implementation to ensure that it handles revoked proxies appropriately and defends against NULL target.
