The provided content is related to CVE-2021-46249.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an authorization bypass in the SpecificApps REST API of ScratchOAuth2. It allows app owners to modify flags related to app verification status.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Authorization bypass: The API allows modification of 'flags' through user-controlled input, which should not be allowed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- App owners can set flags indicating whether an app is verified, potentially leading to misrepresentation of the app's verification status. This could have implications for users who rely on these verification flags.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs through the SpecificApps REST API.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker must be an app owner to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker can make a REST API call to the vulnerable endpoint, providing user-controlled input in the request body.

**Technical Details:**
- The commit message states: "SECURITY: Deny modification of flags using REST API".
- The commit diff shows a change in `includes/api/SpecificApps.php` that prevents users from modifying the 'flags' parameter using a REST API call.
- Prior to this fix, an attacker could send a PATCH request with a `flags` parameter in the JSON body to modify the flags.
- The code now includes a check: `if (array_key_exists('flags', $data)) return $this->getResponseFactory()->createHttpError(403);` which returns a 403 error if the request body includes the `flags` parameter.
