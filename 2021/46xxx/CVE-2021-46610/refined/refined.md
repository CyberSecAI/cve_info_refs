  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing JT files, leading to a read past the end of an allocated buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds read"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information. It can be combined with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a maliciously crafted JT file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious JT file that the user will open."
