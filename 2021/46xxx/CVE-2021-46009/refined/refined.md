Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46009:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The root cause is the lack of proper authentication and authorization checks for certain functionalities.
    *   Specifically, the device allows access to multiple pages without requiring any authentication, which can be achieved via tools like curl or Burp Suite.
    *   Furthermore, administrative configurations, including enabling telnet, can be modified using POST requests without proper authorization or cookie verification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Inadequate Session Management:** The device does not implement session management properly, allowing unauthorized access to page source code.
*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** There is a critical lack of authorization checks when applying new settings to the device using POST requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can view sensitive information by accessing pages without authentication.
*   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes:** Attackers can modify administrative settings, including enabling telnet.
*   **Full System Compromise:** By enabling telnet, attackers can gain root shell access to the device, leading to complete control.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated HTTP Requests:** Attackers can send HTTP requests to the device using tools like `curl` or `Burp Suite` to access protected pages.
*   **Unauthenticated POST Requests:** Attackers can send POST requests to the device to modify administrative settings without any authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** Attackers need a basic understanding of how to send HTTP requests using tools like curl or Burp Suite.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided HackMD document gives a more detailed explanation than the typical CVE description, which is a placeholder in this case.
*   The Proof-of-Concept section in the HackMD content has a placeholder for a YouTube video. This indicates that a demonstration of the exploit is likely available.

In summary, CVE-2021-46009 is a serious vulnerability caused by missing authentication and authorization checks in Totolink A3100R routers, which allows attackers to read sensitive information, modify settings, and gain root shell access.
