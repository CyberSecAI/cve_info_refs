Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46108:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in D-Link DSL-2730E CT-20131125 devices.
- The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `username` parameter on the password page within the maintenance configuration section of the router's web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious JavaScript code can be injected via the username parameter and stored by the application. This means that the XSS payload is not just reflected back to the user submitting the data, but is stored and can be delivered to other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users who access the vulnerable page or feature. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Theft of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, credentials)
    - Defacement of the web interface
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Other malicious actions depending on the attacker's payload

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of the D-Link router.
- An attacker would inject malicious JavaScript code into the `username` field on the password page within the maintenance configuration. The injected script is then stored by the web application and executed when another user accesses the same page

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the D-Link router's web interface. This likely means they would need to be on the same network as the router, or have remote access via port forwarding or other means.
- The attacker would need the ability to interact with the router's web interface, which usually requires knowledge of the administrator credentials.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a link to a GitHub repository that contains information about the vulnerability.
- The content mentions that D-Link does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit, which is common security practice.
- The content also includes links to other security resources on the D-Link website.
