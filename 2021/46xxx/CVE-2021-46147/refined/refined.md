Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46147:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `MassEditRegex` extension for MediaWiki did not properly check for CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens in its form submissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to potentially trick a user into performing unwanted actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could craft a malicious web page that, when visited by a logged-in MediaWiki user, could cause the user's browser to send a forged request to the MediaWiki server. This forged request could then perform actions through the `MassEditRegex` extension, as if the user had initiated it themselves.
*   The specific impact depends on the features of the `MassEditRegex` extension, but it could include actions such as modifying or deleting pages without the user's consent or knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** The primary attack vector is through a malicious website. An attacker would need to lure a logged-in MediaWiki user to visit this website.
*   **Other Social Engineering:** Attackers might also use other social engineering tactics to trick users into clicking malicious links or submitting forms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Target System:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how the `MassEditRegex` extension works and how form data is submitted.
*   **Ability to Host a Malicious Website:** The attacker needs a platform to host the malicious webpage.
*   **Target User is Logged In:** The attack relies on the target user being logged into the MediaWiki instance where the vulnerable extension is installed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by a user (R4356th) from the Wikimedia community.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by adding anti-CSRF mitigations. Patches were created for both the `master` and `REL1_37` branches of the extension.
*   The fix was merged by sbassett from the security team after community code review
*   The CVE was assigned later (mmartorana).
