Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-provided file paths, allowing directory traversal. Specifically, the system did not restrict special symbols like `../` in the path.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Directory traversal vulnerability.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can traverse the file system on the server and access files that they should not have access to.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By crafting a malicious file path including `../` sequences, an attacker could access arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide or manipulate the file path used by the application.

The provided information is more detailed than the basic CVE description of a directory traversal vulnerability, providing specific details on the attack vector (`../` sequences) and the impact (access to files).
