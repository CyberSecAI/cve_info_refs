| I have modified some information unmatched. PTLK. The affected function fxUint8Getter is different from fxFloat32Getter. |

| It appears that root cause here is the same as [#749](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable/issues/749). The POC here is more clear: the problem happens with a malicious compare function. We'll investigate further.  It should be possible to exploit the same root cause with any TypedArray. |
