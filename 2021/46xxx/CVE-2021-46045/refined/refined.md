      "vulnerabilityDetails": {
        "rootCause": "The issue is triggered during the deletion of a 'stco' box (sample table chunk offset box) within the MP4 file structure. A double-free vulnerability occurs within the `stco_box_del` function, which is part of the GPAC library, when handling a crafted MP4 file. This occurs because the `gf_isom_box_del` function can be called multiple times on the same memory address, leading to the double free. The specific input file 'POC10.zip' triggers this behavior. The backtrace shows a series of nested `gf_isom_box_del` calls before crashing within a `free()` call.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Double free vulnerability in `stco_box_del` function.",
          "Improper handling of memory deallocation within the MP4 box structures."
        ],
       "impact": "The impact is an application crash due to memory corruption, which leads to a denial of service. It could potentially be exploitable for arbitrary code execution if the attacker gains control of the memory layout.",
        "attackVectors": [
          "By providing a crafted MP4 file that triggers the double free within the `stco_box_del` function during processing. Input to the `MP4Box` tool is through the command-line argument `-hint POC10`, where 'POC10' is a file that causes this issue"
        ],
        "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted MP4 file as input to the MP4Box tool. This would mean local access to the host where the MP4Box tool is run, or the ability to provide input to it over a different vector."
