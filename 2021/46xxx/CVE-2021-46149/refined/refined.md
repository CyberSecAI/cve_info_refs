Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `languagesearch` API in the Universal Language Selector extension of MediaWiki. The API uses a Levenshtein distance algorithm to perform fuzzy searches for language names. An excessively long search query string can cause the `levenshteinDistance` function to consume excessive server resources, leading to a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unbounded Input:** The `languagesearch` API didn't properly limit the length of the search query string.
*   **Resource Consumption:** The Levenshtein distance calculation is computationally expensive, especially with long input strings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can cause the server to become unresponsive or crash by sending a large number of requests with long search queries. This can disrupt the functionality of the MediaWiki instance and make it inaccessible to legitimate users.
*   **Timeout Errors:** The excessive processing load can trigger timeout errors, as seen in the provided logs.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Endpoint:** The attack is performed by sending crafted HTTP requests to the `/w/api.php?action=languagesearch` endpoint.
*   **Long Search Queries:** The attack is triggered by using extremely long strings in the `search` parameter of the API request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the MediaWiki server.
*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs to know the `/w/api.php?action=languagesearch` API endpoint and its parameters.
*   **Ability to Send Requests:** The attacker must be able to send a high number of specially crafted requests.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was mitigated by adding a check to limit the length of the search query string before performing a fuzzy search. This is done by skipping the fuzzy search when the length of the search query exceeds a predefined limit (25 or 76 characters).

**Additional Details:**
* The issue was found while browsing language team dashboards, seeing timeout errors in logs.
* There was evidence of an intentional denial of service attack on viwiki on 2021-10-17.
* Patches were created for MediaWiki versions 1.35, 1.36, and 1.37, as well as the master branch.
* The fix was included in the 2021.10, 2021.11, and 2021.12 MLEB releases.
* The initial patch was made public by mistake, but no active exploitation was found afterward.
