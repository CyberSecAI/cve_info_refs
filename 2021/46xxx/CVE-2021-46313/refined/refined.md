The provided content relates to a segmentation fault in the GPAC MP4Box tool, which is a potential vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A segmentation fault occurs within the `__memmove_avx_unaligned_erms` function during the processing of a specific input file (POC2.zip). This indicates a memory access violation, likely due to an issue with how memory is being handled during the `memmove` operation, specifically related to unaligned memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption due to incorrect memory access in `__memmove_avx_unaligned_erms` function.
- Likely a buffer overflow or out-of-bounds read/write.
- The usage of AVX instructions with unaligned memory seems to be the trigger.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program termination/crash (segmentation fault).
- Potential for arbitrary code execution if the memory corruption is more controlled or leveraged through other means

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted MP4 file (POC2.zip) processed using the `MP4Box` utility

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a crafted MP4 file to the `MP4Box` tool.
- Local access or ability to provide the crafted file as input (e.g., through a web service that handles such processing).
