- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `$keyword` variable in `admin/ad_manage.php` is directly output without sanitization. This variable is controllable by the `$_REQUEST['keyword']` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could be used to steal cookies, redirect the user to malicious websites, deface the website, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious URL with JavaScript code in the `keyword` parameter and then tricks an administrator into visiting the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to get a logged in administrator to visit a crafted link.
