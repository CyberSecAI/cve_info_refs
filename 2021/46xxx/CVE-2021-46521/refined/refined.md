{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A global buffer overflow occurs in the `c_vsnprintf` function within the `str_util.c` file when handling a specific format string and arguments.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Global buffer overflow.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The global buffer overflow can lead to a crash due to memory corruption. It may also allow for arbitrary code execution if exploited further.",
  "Attack vectors": "By providing a specially crafted format string and arguments to the `c_vsnprintf` function, an attacker can trigger the buffer overflow.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to control the arguments and format string passed to the `c_vsnprintf` function. In this specific case, the format string and arguments are generated based on user provided input via the poc.js code."
