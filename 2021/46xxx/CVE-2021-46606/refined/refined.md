Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-46606:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length when parsing BMP images. Specifically, the software fails to check the size of the data before copying it to a heap-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow.
- Insufficient input validation.
- Out-of-bounds write/read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process. An attacker could potentially gain control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Opening a malicious BMP file using affected software.
- Visiting a malicious web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft a malicious BMP file.
- User interaction is required, the target needs to open the file or visit the malicious page.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
- Bentley has released an update to address this issue in MicroStation CONNECT versions 10.16.02.* and later.
- The vulnerability is related to other similar vulnerabilities in the parsing of BMP files, all fixed in the same update.
- The affected software includes MicroStation and MicroStation-based applications.
- The vendor advises users to only open BMP files from trusted sources as a general security best practice.
