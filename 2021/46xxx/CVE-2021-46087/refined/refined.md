- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input sanitization/validation when users modify their personal information. Specifically, the "remarks" field allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes when an administrator views the user's personal information, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: A low-privileged user modifies their personal information, inserting a malicious payload into the "remarks" field. This stored payload is then triggered when an administrator views this user's profile.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a registered user with the ability to edit their profile.
