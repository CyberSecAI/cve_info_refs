| Thank you for the report.  This PoC can be simplified:  ``` new ArrayBuffer(64).concat({}) ```  FWIW ‚Äì `Array.prototype.concat` is an extension to JavaScript by XS, not part of EcmaScript standard. |

| It looks like that problem snuck in with recent changes to the internal XS buffer representation. I imagine some linter would pick that mistake up. |
