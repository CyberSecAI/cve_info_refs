Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46662:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly mentions CVE-2021-46662 as a vulnerability fixed in MariaDB. The MariaDB Knowledge Base article lists it in the "Full List of CVEs fixed in MariaDB" section and the NetApp advisory also references it. The Jira issue MDEV-25637, which is linked to the CVE, describes a crash related to the set\_var.cc file.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is related to how MariaDB handles certain SQL queries, specifically those involving the `SET` statement. The Jira entry details a crash related to the `sql/set_var.cc` file during a fuzzing test. This suggests a vulnerability exists in the logic handling variable assignments within SQL queries.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The vulnerability is a crash due to a faulty implementation in `sql/set_var.cc` when processing specific SQL statements.  This likely stems from incorrect handling of memory or control flow during the processing of `SET` statements, as indicated by the crash reports in the provided documents.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a Denial of Service (DoS). The server crashes, thus preventing access to the database and its functionality.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is through maliciously crafted SQL queries, specifically `SET` statements. An attacker could inject the specially crafted SQL into the MariaDB server via a variety of routes, such as a web application using an injection vulnerability or by direct connection to the database.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

An attacker requires the ability to submit SQL queries to the MariaDB server. The NetApp advisory states the attack vector to be remote with no required privileges. The Jira entry implies it can be triggered by a user connected to the database.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of MariaDB: MariaDB 10.6.5, 10.5.13, 10.4.22, and 10.3.32 (as per the mariadb.com and jira.mariadb.org content).
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 7.5 (HIGH) with the vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H, indicating a remotely exploitable issue leading to denial of service.
*   NetApp products incorporating vulnerable MariaDB versions are also susceptible, which may include data management platforms. However, the specific NetApp products affected are not listed, only the general vulnerability.
* The content from the Jira issue provides steps to reproduce the crash, including setting up a MariaDB environment with AddressSanitizer, executing the `mysqld_safe` server and then executing the supplied `fuzz.sql` file.

In summary, CVE-2021-46662 is a high-severity vulnerability in MariaDB where crafted SQL `SET` statements can cause a server crash (DoS). It is remotely exploitable with no special privileges needed. This vulnerability has been addressed in the specified MariaDB versions, and users are advised to update.
