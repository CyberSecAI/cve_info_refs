| The POC may be simplified to the following:  ``` var x = "1".repeat(65536); var y = "$1".repeat(32768); x.replace(/(.+)/g, y);  ```  A quick fix is change this line...     [moddable/xs/sources/xsString.c](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable/blob/2f93df297782cf0a31c1797b246becbf5e546f4f/xs/sources/xsString.c#L1883)  Line 1883 in [2f93df2](/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable/commit/2f93df297782cf0a31c1797b246becbf5e546f4f)   |  | l += mxStringLength(capture->value.string); | | --- | --- |      ...to use `fxAddChunkSizes`:  ``` l = fxAddChunkSizes(the, l, mxStringLength(capture->value.string)); ```  But it appears there are other paths where`l` can overflow, so this requires further investigation. |
