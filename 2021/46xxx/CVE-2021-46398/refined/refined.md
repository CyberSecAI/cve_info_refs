{
  "CVE-2021-46398": {
    "root_cause": "The FileBrowser application fails to verify the “Content-Type” HTTP header. It accepts “text/plain” instead of “application/json”, along with missing “Origin” validation and no anti-CSRF tokens.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
       "Improper Input Validation",
      "Insufficient Authentication",
      "Remote Code Execution (RCE)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can create a backdoor user with admin privileges and access to the home directory or any other directory, gaining complete access to the file system. It can lead to RCE because an admin can execute commands.",
    "attack_vectors": "Sending a malicious webpage URL to the legitimate admin.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to trick the admin user to click on a malicious crafted URL or webpage."
