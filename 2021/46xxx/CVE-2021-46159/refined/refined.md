- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of NEU files, leading to a write operation beyond the bounds of an allocated data structure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires user interaction, such as opening a malicious NEU file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a malicious NEU file and convince a user to open it.
