Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-46226:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a command injection vulnerability found in the `wget_test.asp` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands into the system through the `wget_test.asp` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary command execution on the affected device. This can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the device, control its functions, steal sensitive information, or potentially use the device as a bot in a larger network attack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is LAN-side, implying the attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device or have access through a compromised device on the LAN.
*   The specific attack involves injecting commands through the vulnerable `wget_test.asp` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be on the same LAN as the vulnerable device.
*   The attacker must be able to send commands/requests to the web interface of the device utilizing the vulnerable `wget_test.asp` function.
