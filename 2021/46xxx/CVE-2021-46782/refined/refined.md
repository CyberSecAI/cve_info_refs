- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize the `tab` parameter before outputting it within an HTML attribute in the admin dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable page. This can lead to various malicious actions, including session hijacking, cookie theft, and defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL containing the payload in the `tab` parameter and tricking a user into visiting it (e.g., through social engineering or malicious links).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a logged-in administrator user into accessing it.
