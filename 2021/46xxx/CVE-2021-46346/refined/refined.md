- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The issue arises from the `Date.prototype.setYear` function not invalidating the cached time zone adjustment (tza) when the year is set, causing an assertion failure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect caching of timezone adjustment in Date object leading to assertion failure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability leads to an internal assertion failure, causing the JerryScript engine to abort.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by using `Date.prototype.setYear` with specific year values.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within the JerryScript engine with carefully crafted date manipulation via `setYear`.
