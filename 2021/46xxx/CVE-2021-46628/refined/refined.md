Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of BMP images. This inadequate validation leads to a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability in BMP file parsing.
- Insufficient input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can potentially disclose sensitive information by reading beyond the buffer.
- Code Execution: By combining this vulnerability with other vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Opening a maliciously crafted BMP file.
- Visiting a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability by displaying/processing a malicious BMP file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious BMP file.
- The attacker needs to get the user to open the malicious file or visit a malicious webpage containing the malicious file.
- User interaction is required

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Bentley View and MicroStation
- Bentley has released an update to fix this vulnerability.
- This vulnerability is part of a larger set of out-of-bounds vulnerabilities related to BMP file parsing in Bentley products.
