Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46623:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of 3DS files within Bentley View.
- It stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the 3DS file, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The software attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer, which can lead to information disclosure.
- Inadequate validation of user-supplied data: The software does not properly check the data within the 3DS file, allowing malicious data to trigger the out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker can potentially read sensitive information from the application's memory due to the out-of-bounds read.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: By exploiting this vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious 3DS file: An attacker can craft a malicious 3DS file that triggers the out-of-bounds read when opened by a vulnerable application.
- User interaction required: The target user must open the malicious 3DS file or visit a malicious page to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create a malicious 3DS file: An attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted 3DS file containing data that will trigger the vulnerability.
- Social engineering:  The attacker needs to convince the victim to open the crafted 3DS file.

**Additional Information:**
- Bentley has released updates to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
- This CVE is associated with the ZDI-22-210 and ZDI-CAN-15453 identifiers from the Zero Day Initiative.
- This vulnerability is one of several fixed in the BE-2021-0004 advisory.
- The advisory states that versions of MicroStation and Bentley View prior to 10.16.02.* are affected, with 10.16.02.* and later containing the fix.

**CVSS Score:** 3.3 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) according to the ZDI advisory, however the Bentley advisory lists the score as 7.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). The difference is likely due to the inclusion of other related vulnerabilities in the Bentley score.
