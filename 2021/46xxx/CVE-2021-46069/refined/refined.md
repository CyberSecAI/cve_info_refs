Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the "Mechanic List" section of the Vehicle Service Management System. Specifically, user-provided input in the "Full Name & Contact" fields is not properly sanitized before being stored and rendered in the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary weakness is the ability to inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored within the system's database and executed when the affected page is viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of other users who access the "Mechanic List" section. This can lead to:
    - Cookie stealing
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the page
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Other malicious activities depending on the injected payload

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Mechanic List" section within the admin panel of the Vehicle Service Management System.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative access to the Vehicle Service Management System. Specifically, they need to be able to access the admin panel and have permissions to add or modify data in the "Mechanic List" section.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided payload `"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` demonstrates how an attacker can inject a script tag and execute arbitrary JavaScript code.
- The vulnerability is located in the Full Name & Contact input fields within the Mechanic List section.

**Mitigation:**
- The recommended mitigation is to sanitize all user inputs throughout the application. This includes encoding user-provided data to prevent the execution of malicious code within the application's pages.
