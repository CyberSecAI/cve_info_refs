- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL injection in the `eid` parameter of `account.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly sanitize user input (`eid` parameter) before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    -  An attacker can gain control of all accounts, including the administrator account.
    -  The attacker can use `load_file` to potentially interact with external domains/resources.
- **Attack vectors:**
    -  The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted GET request to `account.php`.
    -  Specifically, the `eid` parameter in the URL is used for injecting SQL payloads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application. No specific position within the network is mentioned.
