The provided content relates to CVE-2021-46495.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-use-after-free error in the `DeleteTreeValue` function within `src/jsiObj.c` at line 176. This occurs when the code attempts to access memory that has already been freed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-use-after-free vulnerability in `DeleteTreeValue` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The program crashes due to memory corruption, leading to a denial-of-service.
- AddressSanitizer (ASan) detects the heap-use-after-free.

**Attack vectors:**
- The provided code snippet demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability. Specifically the exploit is triggered by a crafted javascript code that leads to memory corruption during object deletion.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to execute crafted JavaScript code within the `jsish` environment to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker can be a user with the ability to execute jsish code.

**Additional notes:**
- The issue was found using AddressSanitizer (ASan), and the provided stack trace and ASan output show the sequence of function calls leading to the error, as well as the memory location of the freed memory.
- The issue was fixed by commit `779c601c6645353bab7a8d1acba2197ddf79d26f`.
