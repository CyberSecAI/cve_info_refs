DIR-878 Rev Ax F/W v1.30B06 Hotfix 02 :: (Non-US) DI-7200GV2 Rev. E1 F/W v21.04.09E1 :: CVE-2021-46226 thru CVE-2021-46233 :: Multiple Vulnerability

**Overview**

On January 6, 2021, a 3rd party security researcher reported the D-Link ((Non-US) DI-7200GV2 hardware revision E1 with firmware version 21.04.09E1 and DIR-878 hardware revision A with firmware version v1.30B08\_Hotfix\_02 with a number of potential vulnerabilities.

As soon as D-Link was made aware of the reported security issues, we had promptly started our investigation and began developing security patches. The 3rd party publically disclosed the issue prior to the patches being available on our standard 90 day security patch release schedule. We do not recommend security researches act in this manner as they expose end-users to further risks without patches being available from the manufacture.

D-Link takes the issues of network security and user privacy very seriously. We have a dedicated task force and product management team on call to address evolving security issues and implement appropriate security measures.
