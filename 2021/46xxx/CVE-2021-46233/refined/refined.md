Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46233:

**Summary:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2021-46233
*   **Vulnerability:** Command Injection
*   **Location:** LAN-Side, in the function `msp_info.htm`

**Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization or validation in the `msp_info.htm` function. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands that will be executed by the underlying operating system.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Command injection is the primary weakness. The web interface of the affected D-Link devices fails to properly sanitize input when processing user-provided data, making it vulnerable to malicious command execution.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful command injection exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device. This can lead to:
    *   Full compromise of the device.
    *   Data exfiltration
    *   Installation of malware.
    *   Denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the LAN-side interface of the device, meaning an attacker would need to have network access to the device. The specific mechanism or parameters through which the `msp_info.htm` function is exploited is not detailed.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be on the same LAN as the vulnerable device.
    *   The attacker would require some level of familiarity with the device's web interface and its parameters for exploiting the `msp_info.htm` function.

**Affected Products:**

*   DIR-878 (Hardware Revision A, Firmware v1.30B06 Hotfix 02 and below)
*   DI-7200GV2 (Hardware Revision E1, Firmware v21.04.09E1 and below)

**Fix Information**

*   For DIR-878, a fixed firmware version `v1.30B08 Hotfix_04` has been released.
*   For DI-7200GV2, a patch is under investigation and pending release.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that the issue was publicly disclosed by a third party before a patch was available.
*   D-Link recommends that users update their firmware to the latest available versions to address the vulnerability.
