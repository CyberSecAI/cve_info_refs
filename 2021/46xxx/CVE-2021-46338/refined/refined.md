```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from a recursive first property access within `Array.prototype.shift`. After a property is deleted, the previous call frames' function object or lexical environment become invalid memory references.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free due to incorrect handling of lexical environments during recursive property access.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can lead to a crash or unexpected behavior due to an internal assertion failure, indicating a memory corruption issue.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a JavaScript code snippet that exploits the recursive behavior of `Array.prototype.shift` with a getter function.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary Javascript code within the vulnerable environment (Jerryscript)."
