{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing directory traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Directory traversal vulnerability exists in the file download function, caused by insufficient path validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially gaining access to sensitive information.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can manipulate the path parameter in the file download request to include '../' sequences to access files outside of the intended directory.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated as an admin user and be able to access the file manager and download functionalities."
