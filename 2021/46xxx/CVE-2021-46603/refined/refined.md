The provided content relates to CVE-2021-46603.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length before copying it to a heap-based buffer when parsing J2K images.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Heap-based buffer overflow

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves a user opening a maliciously crafted J2K file within the affected software or visiting a malicious page that triggers the vulnerable code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to create a malicious J2K file. The user must then open this file using a vulnerable version of Bentley MicroStation CONNECT for the attack to be successful. User interaction is required, meaning the victim needs to open the malicious file for the vulnerability to be triggered.
