Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-46596

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing OBJ files in Bentley MicroStation and MicroStation-based applications. This leads to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The software reads past the end of an allocated buffer while processing a maliciously crafted OBJ file. This can lead to information disclosure or further exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially disclose sensitive information by triggering the out-of-bounds read.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** The vulnerability could be leveraged with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious OBJ file:** An attacker can craft a malicious OBJ file that triggers the vulnerability when opened by a vulnerable version of MicroStation or a MicroStation-based application.
*   **User Interaction:** The target user needs to open the malicious OBJ file or visit a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to create or deliver a specially crafted OBJ file to the victim.
*   The attacker relies on the user to open the malicious file or interact with a malicious page.

**Affected Products:**
*   Bentley MicroStation
*   Bentley View (and other MicroStation-based applications)

**Affected Versions:**
*   Versions prior to 10.16.02.\* for both MicroStation and Bentley View

**Mitigation:**
*   Update to version 10.16.02.\* or later of MicroStation and MicroStation-based applications.
*   Only open OBJ files from trusted sources.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
*   The ZDI advisory refers to the vulnerability as "Bentley MicroStation CONNECT OBJ File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure Vulnerability" and is identified as ZDI-22-183 and ZDI-CAN-15390.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 3.3 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).
