| Which fuzzer do you mean? If you mean Binaryen fuzzer, it prints a seed with which you can reproduce the error. You can report the bug with your version and the seed. If you are unsure what seed is, you can attach the whole error message from the fuzzer.  If you mean another fuzzer, that fuzzer can have a bug, but we don't have any idea, because it's not ours. |

| I use the genertated POC5 as a input to execute the program, the assertion is happen（POC5 is generated by the fuzzer, but the program is installed normally）:  ``` ./wasm-ctor-eval ../../../../POC5  wasm-ctor-eval: /home/zxq/CVE_testing/source/binaryen/src/wasm/wasm-binary.cpp:6500: void wasm::WasmBinaryBuilder::visitRethrow(wasm::Rethrow*): Assertion `curr->target != DELEGATE_CALLER_TARGET' failed. [1]    3409714 abort      ./wasm-ctor-eval ../../../../POC5   ```  If you think this problem is caused by unvalid input, please ignore it, the input is indeed malformed data.  Thank you. |

| POC5 is generated by the fuzzer, but the program is installed normally  Are you talking about the Binaryen fuzzer? If so please report the bug with the seed. If Binaryen fuzzer generated an invalid wasm file, it should have errored out with a meaningful error message, which contains the seed. |

| I looked at two of these now and opened quick PRs. Overall I think improving errors on invalid inputs is generally worthwhile, but definitely very low priority. Real users are extremely unlikely to be hit by these errors. This is just not where our main source of bugs is. So, yeah, I'm not sure it's worth filing these to be honest.  But we would be very interested in any *functional* bugs that you can find [@ZFeiXQ](https://github.com/ZFeiXQ) , that is, on valid inputs - things like a pass changing the behavior of the wasm, or a pass being nondeterministic, or infinite looping, etc.  Alternatively, invalid inputs that are generated by real-world tools (like if LLVM somehow emits a bad wasm file) would be very interesting as well. |
