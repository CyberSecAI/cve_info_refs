| Thank you for the report!  The crash occurs in after the test exits. The call to fxDeleteMachine crashes when calls the destructor of the timer created by `setInterval`.  ``` while (bSlot < cSlot) { 	if ((bSlot->kind == XS_HOST_KIND) && (bSlot->value.host.variant.destructor)) { 		if (bSlot->flag & XS_HOST_HOOKS_FLAG) { 			if (bSlot->value.host.variant.hooks->destructor) 				(*(bSlot->value.host.variant.hooks->destructor))(bSlot->value.host.data); 		} 		else 			(*(bSlot->value.host.variant.destructor))(bSlot->value.host.data); 	} 	bSlot++; } ```  This may be a bug in the `xst` tool rather than the XS engine. Either way, we'll fix that so it doesn't get in the way of testing. |
