Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in H.H.G multistore, which are not directly related to CVE-2021-46448, as the provided content contains vulnerabilities found by a user in the described software.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Certificate Validation Disabled:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The software disables certificate validation in `core/classes/class.afterbuy.php`.
    *   **Weaknesses:** This makes the software vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, as it will accept any certificate presented by the server it communicates with.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can intercept and modify communications between the application and other servers.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Network-based.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Needs to be positioned on the network path between the application and its server.
*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Improperly sanitized user inputs in several parameters.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Allows direct SQL query manipulation.
    *   **Impact:** Database data can be read, modified, or deleted.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** HTTP requests with malicious SQL payloads in the following parameters: `cID`, `agID`, `aagID`, `box_group_id`.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
*   **Unrestricted File Uploads:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of filtering for uploaded files in image upload functionalities.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Allows any file type to be uploaded.
    *   **Impact:** Can upload arbitrary files (e.g., PHP webshells), leading to remote code execution.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Any image upload location.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires access to the backend or an order creation that would allow file upload.
*   **Insecure Password Handling:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Using MD5 with a static salt for password storage.
    *   **Weaknesses:** MD5 is considered broken and susceptible to rainbow table attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to easily crack user passwords.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Database access required, or password hashes exposed in another manner.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Database access needed or if user data is leaked.
*   **Open Redirect:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application redirects users to a URL specified in the `goto` parameter without proper validation.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Allows redirection to an arbitrary URL.
    *   **Impact:** Phishing attacks or redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Attack Vector:** User interaction through crafted links.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to craft URLs.
*   **Path Traversal:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of the `path` parameter when requesting files via `simogeoFilemanager`.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Allows access to files and directories outside the intended scope.
    *   **Impact:** Can download sensitive files or enumerate the file system.
    *   **Attack Vector:** HTTP requests with directory traversal sequences in the `path` parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires access to the backend.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (Stored):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Unsanitized user input in the "state" field of an address.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Allows injecting malicious JavaScript that executes when viewing orders.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the backend user's browser, enabling further attacks like arbitrary file uploads through XSS.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious scripts into the state field when creating a new address.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Needs to be able to create a customer account and place an order.

**Additional Points:**

*   The software is considered end-of-life with no patches available.
*   Static salt is used for coupon codes.
*   Users can hide their accounts by setting invalid address id's.

**Conclusion:**
The provided content details multiple severe security vulnerabilities in HHG Multistore, including SQL injections, unrestricted file uploads, path traversal, and XSS. These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to gain full control over the system. The software is also using outdated and insecure practices, such as MD5 for password hashing and disabling certificate validation.
