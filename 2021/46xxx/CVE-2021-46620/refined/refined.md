Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of FBX files within Bentley MicroStation CONNECT. Specifically, it stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The lack of input validation leads to a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: Attackers can potentially disclose sensitive information due to the out-of-bounds read.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution:  The vulnerability can be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious FBX files: Attackers can craft malicious FBX files containing specially crafted data that triggers the out-of-bounds read during parsing.
- User interaction required: The attack requires user interaction, specifically, the user must open a malicious FBX file using the vulnerable software or visit a malicious page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted FBX file to the user of the vulnerable application. No special access to the target system is needed.

**Additional Notes:**

- The advisory mentions that Bentley has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
- The advisory also references two other related CVEs: CVE-2021-34886 and CVE-2021-46630, suggesting that they also involve similar vulnerabilities with FBX file parsing in Bentley products.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 3.3, with an attack vector of local, low complexity, no privileges needed, user interaction required, no change of scope, low confidentiality impact, no integrity impact, and no availability impact.
