Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46453:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is a command injection flaw present in the `SetStaticRouteSettings` function of the D-Link DIR-823-Pro router's firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Command Injection:** The `SetStaticRouteSettings` function does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system. This can lead to:
    * Complete compromise of the router.
    * Modification of router settings.
    * Installation of malware.
    * Data exfiltration.
    * Denial of service.
    * Use of the router as a bot in a botnet.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **LAN-side Attack:** The vulnerability is accessible from the local network (LAN) side. This means an attacker needs to have a presence on the same network as the vulnerable router.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker must be on the same local network as the D-Link DIR-823-Pro router with hardware revision Ax and firmware v1.0.2 or below.
* The attacker needs the ability to send crafted network requests to the router exploiting the `SetStaticRouteSettings` function.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vendor states that the device is EOL/EOS and recommends users retire and replace the device.
* This vulnerability is one of six related vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-46452 through CVE-2021-46457) affecting the same device and firmware version.
