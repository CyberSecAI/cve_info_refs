*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory leak due to improper resource management.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to out-of-bounds access, likely due to memory exhaustion or corruption after repeated memory leaks.
*  **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vector is not detailed. However, it would likely involve repeated operations that trigger the memory allocation within the `HW_KEYMASTER` module without subsequent freeing of that memory.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to trigger the memory allocation routines within the `HW_KEYMASTER` module on a device running the vulnerable software.
