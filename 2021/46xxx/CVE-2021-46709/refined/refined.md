- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application directly echoes user-controlled input from the `$_GET['newRows']` parameter into the `value` attribute of a hidden input field without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with the `newRows` parameter set to a payload containing JavaScript code, like `3'/> <script> alert(1) </script>'/>`. When a user accesses the crafted URL, the injected script will be executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs the ability to craft a malicious URL that is then accessed by a user of the vulnerable application.
