- **Root cause:** Lack of length check in the HW\_KEYMASTER module.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is a lack of length check which can lead to out-of-bounds access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can construct malicious data and cause out-of-bounds access.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability lies in the HW\_KEYMASTER module, specifically in how it handles data length. Maliciously crafted data is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted malicious data to the HW\_KEYMASTER module. The level of access required is not explicitly stated.
