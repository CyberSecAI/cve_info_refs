Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46457:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a command injection flaw present in the `ChgSambaUserSettings` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command injection vulnerability. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands by injecting malicious input into the affected function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the affected device, potentially leading to complete system compromise. This could include:
    - Data theft or manipulation
    - Malware installation
    - Denial of service
    - Full control of the device

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is LAN-side, meaning an attacker must have access to the local network where the vulnerable D-Link device is connected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same LAN as the vulnerable device.
- The attacker would need to send a malicious crafted request to the vulnerable `ChgSambaUserSettings` function, this could be done through the web interface if exposed on the lan or through other communication channels if present in the firmware of the device.

**Affected Products:**
- D-Link DIR-823-Pro hardware revision Ax with firmware version v1.0.2 and below (Non-US region).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor was notified of the vulnerability by a third-party researcher
- The vendor did not release a patch before public disclosure.
- The vendor recommends users to replace/retire the affected hardware.
- This vulnerability is one of a series of command injection vulnerabilities affecting this device (CVE-2021-46452 through CVE-2021-46457).
