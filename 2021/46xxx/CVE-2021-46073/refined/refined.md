Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-46073

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization within the "User List" section of the Vehicle Service Management System. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the "First Name" and "Last Name" fields when creating a new user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This means that malicious JavaScript code can be injected and stored within the application's database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code.
- When an administrator views the user list, the injected JavaScript code executes within their browser. This could lead to:
   - Cookie stealing, allowing the attacker to impersonate an administrator.
   - Account takeover, enabling the attacker to gain full control over the system.
   - Other malicious activities like redirecting the user to a phishing website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "User List" creation form in the admin panel of the Vehicle Service Management System.
- An attacker needs to have access to the admin panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to access the admin panel and the "User List" section.
- The attacker needs to be able to fill the "First Name" and "Last Name" fields with the malicious payload and save the new user.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided payload is: `"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`
- The vulnerability is located in the user creation process. Inputting the payload in the "First Name" or "Last Name" fields stores the payload. When the user list is loaded, the payload is executed within the administrator's browser.

**Mitigation:**
- The recommended mitigation is to sanitize all input fields throughout the application, preventing the execution of malicious JavaScript code.
