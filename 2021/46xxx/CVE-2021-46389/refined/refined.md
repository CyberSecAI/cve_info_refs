The provided content is related to commits that address issues in the iipsrv project, specifically commits `882925b295a80ec992063deffc2a3b0d803c3195` and `4ed59265fbbd636dc2fbbf325f8ea37ed300a6d9`. These commits are linked to issue #223, which is mentioned in the commit messages. The changesets address integer overflows when allocating memory and add checks to prevent crashes related to invalid tile requests.

**Commit 882925b295a80ec992063deffc2a3b0d803c3195:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflows when calculating memory allocation sizes for image tiles, leading to heap buffer overflow when allocating memory using `new`. There was also a missing check for `malloc` allocation failures.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Integer overflow vulnerability: using `int` type which can overflow when calculating the size of memory to be allocated for image tiles.
    * Missing check for `malloc` failures, if the memory allocation with `malloc` failed, there was no check and thus code can proceed with a `NULL` pointer.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Heap buffer overflows leading to crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:** By requesting large image tiles that result in large memory allocation sizes that overflow the `int` type used for width/height/channels calculations.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to influence parameters that control the size of image tiles requested.

**Fixes in this commit:**

*   The commit modifies `TileManager.cc` to verify that `malloc()` has correctly allocated memory using a null pointer check and throw a `std::bad_alloc` exception if memory allocation fails.
*   Numerical types in `RawTile.h`, `TileManager.cc`, `KakaduImage.cc`, `OpenJPEG.cc`, and `Transforms.cc` are updated to `std::size_t` when allocating memory via `new` to avoid integer overflows.

**Commit 4ed59265fbbd636dc2fbbf325f8ea37ed300a6d9:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing checks for image validity before accessing image data and missing validation of requested tile resolutions, which can lead to crashes.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Lack of checks to verify if image data has been set before accessing it
    *   Missing validation to ensure that requested tile resolution is within the valid range.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Crash of the application when accessing image data before it's set, or when requesting invalid tile resolutions.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted request with invalid resolutions or parameters before a proper image has been set.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send commands to the iipsrv service.

**Fixes in this commit:**

*   Adds verification that the image has been set in `SPECTRA.cc`
*   Adds a check on the validity of the requested tile resolution in `JTL.cc`

These changes address integer overflows, memory allocation errors, and missing image/resolution checks that could lead to crashes in the iipsrv application. The commits provide a detailed fix for the issues.
