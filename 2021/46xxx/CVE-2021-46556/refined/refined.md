- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A segmentation fault (SEGV) occurs in the `mjs_bcode_insert_offset` function within `src/mjs_bcode.c` at line 67. This appears to be related to a memory access issue, as indicated by the AddressSanitizer output, specifically a read memory access to an invalid address (0x00000000008c).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The code contains a bug that leads to a segmentation fault during bytecode manipulation, specifically while inserting an offset.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact of this vulnerability is a crash of the application. The AddressSanitizer output clearly indicates that the program receives a deadly signal (SIGSEGV) causing it to terminate abruptly.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by executing a specially crafted JavaScript code. The provided `poc.js` contains a complex expression utilizing JSON.stringify and JSON.parse that when executed, leads to the crash within the bytecode manipulation part of the interpreter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable mjs interpreter. This could be achieved through various means depending on how the interpreter is integrated into an application. The provided issue shows a local execution scenario as a demonstration of the bug.
