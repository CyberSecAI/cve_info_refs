The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the MCMS (MingSoft Content Management System).

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the direct concatenation of the `orderBy` parameter from user input into the SQL query in `IBaseDao.xml` without any sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the unsanitized usage of the orderBy parameter in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially manipulate the SQL queries to:
    - Extract sensitive data from the database.
    - Modify data in the database.
    - Potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands, depending on the database permissions.
- The specific impact could include data breaches, data manipulation, and complete compromise of the database server if the database user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `/queryData` route, where the `orderBy` parameter is received as part of the request.
- By manipulating the value of the `orderBy` parameter, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the `/queryData` route and control the `orderBy` parameter.
- Although not explicitly stated, this likely requires some access to the application, potentially even a logged-in user, given the described issue appears to be in the admin panel and the 'Content Risk Flag' mention.
