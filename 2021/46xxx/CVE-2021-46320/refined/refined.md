- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Reentrancy in initializer functions when invoked separately from contract creation (e.g., using minimal proxies) due to an exception made for multiple inheritance. This allows re-execution of initializer logic.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reentrancy vulnerability in initializer functions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Double initialization of a contract, leading to unexpected behavior.
- **Attack vectors**: Invoking an initializer function with a reentrant external call when the initializer is not executed as part of contract creation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to invoke the initializer function, and that initializer must make an untrusted external call which enables re-entry.
