- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unauthorized access to API endpoints due to a lack of proper authentication or authorization mechanisms. The application uses mock interfaces for development purposes, which are exposed in the frontend, leading to sensitive data leakage.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** Lack of authorization allows unauthenticated users to directly access sensitive data by accessing API endpoints like `/api/v1/users`.
    - **Information Disclosure:** The exposed API endpoints return sensitive information, such as user IDs, names, ages, phone numbers, and addresses.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive user data by directly querying the exposed API endpoints. This can lead to a privacy breach, identity theft, and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is accessing the exposed API endpoints directly, for example, through a `curl` request or a web browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to know the URL of the vulnerable API endpoint. No prior authentication or specific capabilities are required. An attacker can be located anywhere with network access to the vulnerable application.
