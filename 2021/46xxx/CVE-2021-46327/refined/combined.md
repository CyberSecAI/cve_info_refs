| When the testcase changed a little, there's a new crash during fuzzing. I'm not sure whether it's a duplicated issue or not. If its not, I'll open a new issue. Hope the info listed as follows will be helpful! Test case poc.js ```  ``` var size = 1000; var array1 = new Array(size);  function toStr() {     array1.splice(0, 2);     return array1.toString(); }  function JSEtest() {     for (var i = 0; i < size; i++) {         array1[i] = new Array(i);         array1.sort()[i].toString = toStr;     }     array1.sort(); }  JSEtest(); ```     ```   Execution & Output ``` $ ./moddable/build/bin/lin/debug/xst poc.js  AddressSanitizer:DEADLYSIGNAL ================================================================= ==39035==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address 0x0000000004c0 (pc 0x00000059c0a6 bp 0x7ffc9a80fa50 sp 0x7ffc9a80f730 T0) ==39035==The signal is caused by a READ memory access. ==39035==Hint: address points to the zero page.     #0 0x59c0a5 in fxCompareArrayItem /home/f1yfuzz/moddable/xs/sources/xsArray.c:350:18     #1 0x57dc9a in fx_Array_prototype_sort /home/f1yfuzz/moddable/xs/sources/xsArray.c:2235:14     #2 0x84f3ca in fxRunID /home/f1yfuzz/moddable/xs/sources/xsRun.c:842:7     #3 0x8ceaac in fxRunScript /home/f1yfuzz/moddable/xs/sources/xsRun.c:4766:4     #4 0xad3231 in fxRunProgramFile /home/f1yfuzz/moddable/xs/tools/xst.c:1387:2     #5 0xacfa83 in main /home/f1yfuzz/moddable/xs/tools/xst.c:281:8     #6 0x7f8d44116bf6 in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-S9d2JN/glibc-2.27/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:310     #7 0x42ddc9 in _start (/usr/local/bin/xst+0x42ddc9)  AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.

| Thanks! From a quick look, it is tough to say if these are the same cause or not – the tests and crash are quite similar but the crash is in a different place. We'll investigate and let you know. |

| This has been resolved in our most recent Moddable SDK update. There were changes to Array sorting and a change to xst to ensure a clean exit when the JavaScript stack overflow is detected. Thank you again for the report. |
