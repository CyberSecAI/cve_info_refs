The provided content is related to CVE-2021-46351.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The issue arises from the `Date.prototype.setYear` function in JerryScript not invalidating the cached time zone adjustment (tza) after the year is set.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect time zone adjustment calculation due to cached tza not being updated after the year is modified. This leads to an internal assertion failure.
- The `Date.prototype.setYear()` function doesn't invalidate the cached tza value

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability results in an internal assertion failure causing the program to crash with an `ICE: Assertion` error.
- The crash leads to a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted JavaScript code that utilizes `Date.prototype.setYear()` to trigger the assertion failure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within a JerryScript environment.
- No specific privilege is needed beyond the ability to execute code.

**Technical Details:**

- The issue was found in the `ecma_builtin_date_prototype_dispatch_routine` function, specifically at line 689 in `jerryscript/jerry-core/ecma/builtin-objects/ecma-builtin-date-prototype.c`.
- The assertion `local_tza == ecma_date_local_time_zone_adjustment (date_value)` fails.
- The provided PoC code demonstrates how to trigger the issue by creating a `Date` object, modifying its year via `setYear()`, then accessing the date parts.
- The bug was fixed by invalidating cached tza when Date.prototype.setYear is called, ensuring the timezone adjustment is recalculated when a date's year is changed via the `setYear()` method.
