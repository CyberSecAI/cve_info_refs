Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46667:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow in the `sql_lex.cc` file. This overflow occurs during the processing of SQL statements, specifically when dealing with integer values.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Integer overflow:** The core issue is an integer overflow, which can lead to unexpected behavior and memory corruption within the MariaDB server.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in a crash of the MariaDB server. This can lead to a denial-of-service condition, as the server becomes unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by crafting specific SQL statements that cause the integer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Ability to submit SQL queries:**  An attacker must be able to execute SQL queries against the MariaDB server. This could be done through a compromised application, a user with database access, or potentially through some form of SQL injection.

**Additional Details**

- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing.
- The issue affects MariaDB versions 10.4.18, 10.5.9 and 10.5.13 and is fixed in versions 10.2.41, 10.3.32, 10.4.22, 10.5.13, and 10.6.5.
- A simplified `fuzz.sql` file was created to reproduce the crash and is included in the issue report on Jira.
- The vulnerability is located in the Optimizer component of MariaDB.
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `select_lex->ref_pointer_array.size() % 5 == 0` assertion failure.
- The vulnerability is present in MariaDB server versions prior to 10.2.41, 10.3.32, 10.4.22, 10.5.13, and 10.6.5.
