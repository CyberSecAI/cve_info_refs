```
Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies within the `jsi_ArraySpliceCmd` function in `src/jsiArray.c` at line 1172, specifically due to insufficient input sanitization when handling the arguments of the `splice` command within the `jsish` Javascript interpreter.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Insufficient input sanitization leads to a segmentation fault (SEGV) when the `splice` command receives unexpected or invalid input, particularly when a non-numeric value is passed as an argument, leading to out-of-bounds memory access when dealing with array indices.

Impact of exploitation: A successful exploitation results in a segmentation fault, causing the program to crash. This can lead to a denial-of-service condition.

Attack vectors: The attack vector involves crafting a specific JavaScript program using the `jsish` interpreter. The crafted code uses the `splice` command with a non-numeric argument, causing the program to crash.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to execute a crafted JavaScript file with the `jsish` interpreter. This can be achieved by direct interaction with the `jsish` interpreter or by any method that allows execution of a javascript file through `jsish`.
