The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Online Car Rental System version 1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not sanitize user-supplied input when adding a new vehicle. Specifically, the `vehicalorcview` parameter is vulnerable to XSS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `vehicalorcview` parameter, which will be stored in the database. When a user views the vehicle details, the malicious script will be executed in their browser, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Stealing cookies.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript code.
- The attacker submits a POST request to `admin/post-avehical.php` including the malicious payload in the `vehicalorcview` parameter.
- The injected script is stored in the database.
- When a user navigates to the car rental page, the stored script is executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the application's admin panel, or have the ability to make a POST request to `admin/post-avehical.php` with malicious payloads.
- The attacker needs to know the parameter name (`vehicalorcview`) to inject the malicious script.
