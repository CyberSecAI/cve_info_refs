The content is related to CVE-2021-46337.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a failure in the JerryScript parser when resolving private identifiers. Specifically, the issue arises in the `parser_list_get` function within `js-parser-mem.c` where an assertion `page_p != NULL` fails. This suggests an issue with memory management or accessing an invalid memory location when handling private class fields/methods.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect memory access
- Assertion failure in parser list retrieval
- Potential for further exploitation due to memory access issues

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program termination due to assertion failure. The specific error output is: `ICE: Assertion 'page_p != NULL' failed at jerryscript/jerry-core/parser/js/js-parser-mem.c(parser_list_get):279. Error: ERR_FAILED_INTERNAL_ASSERTION [1] 36899 abort jerry poc.js`
- Denial of Service

**Attack vectors:**
- Execution of specially crafted JavaScript code that utilizes private class fields in a specific way that triggers the bug

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide malicious Javascript code to be parsed by JerryScript.
- No special privileges are required.
