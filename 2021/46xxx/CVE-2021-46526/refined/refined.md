- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A global buffer overflow occurs in the `snquote` function within `src/mjs_json.c`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The code attempts to write past the bounds of a globally allocated buffer. Specifically, it's writing past the `*.LC1` global variable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The overflow can lead to a crash due to memory corruption. The AddressSanitizer detected a global-buffer-overflow leading to program termination.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through crafted JavaScript code that uses `JSON.stringify`. The specific exploit uses `(JSON.stringify([1, 2, 3]))((JSON.parse - 10900)(JSON.stringify([1, 2, 3])));`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to execute arbitrary Javascript using the vulnerable `mjs` engine. This could be through a web browser or other application using the library.

The provided information gives the exact location of the overflow in source code file and the instruction that causes it, along with a sample exploit.
