Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of the FreeMarker template engine without proper security configurations, combined with insufficient validation during file operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1. **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** The application uses FreeMarker templates without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject malicious code into templates. The provided payload `<#assign value="freemarker.template.utility.Execute"?new()>${value("whoami")}` demonstrates the ability to execute arbitrary system commands.
2. **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The application allows deleting files based on user-supplied parameters, specifically `oldFileName`, without sufficient validation or authorization checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1. **SSTI:** Successful exploitation of the SSTI vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server. This can lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, and denial of service.
2. **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker can delete any file on the server that the application has access to, leading to data loss, application malfunction, or potentially denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
1. **SSTI:** The attacker injects the malicious payload into the template management settings through the administrative interface ("background - > system settings - > template management").
2. **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The attacker sends a request to the application with the `fileName` and `oldFileName` parameters. The `oldFileName` parameter specifies the file to delete. The example `fileName=x&oldFileName=file destination` shows how an attacker could trigger this.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1. **SSTI:**
    - The attacker needs access to the administrative interface of the application, specifically the section to manage templates. This implies the attacker would likely need administrative or high-privilege credentials.
2. **Arbitrary File Deletion:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application and needs to be able to provide the vulnerable parameters `fileName` and `oldFileName`. It isn't explicit if authentication is needed, so an unauthenticated attacker may also be able to trigger this if the file deletion functionality is exposed without proper auth checks.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in the `net/mingsoft/basic/action/TemplateAction.java` and `net/mingsoft/basic/util/BasicUtil.java` files.
- The code includes a suffix check which seems insufficient.
- The `GetRealTemplatePath` method is being used to derive the file path.
- The vulnerability was found in the MCMS project.
- The issue report includes screenshots of the vulnerable sections of the application and code.
