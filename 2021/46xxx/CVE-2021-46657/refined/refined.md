Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-46657:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

The content from `jira.mariadb.org` directly references CVE-2021-46657 as an issue link for the MariaDB crash bug (MDEV-25629). The advisory from `security.netapp.com` also lists CVE-2021-46657 as one of the vulnerabilities affecting MariaDB. Thus, the content is **RELEVANT**.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause of the vulnerability lies within the `get_sort_by_table()` function in MariaDB's optimizer, specifically when dealing with subqueries using `ORDER BY` clauses that reference outer tables (outer references).

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-  The vulnerability manifests as a crash in the `get_sort_by_table()` function of the MariaDB query optimizer.
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specific type of subquery that includes `ORDER BY` and `HAVING` clauses which uses outer references.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

-  The primary impact of this vulnerability is a **Denial of Service (DoS)**, leading to a crash of the MariaDB server. The severity is marked as "Critical" in the Jira ticket.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through crafted SQL queries, specifically those involving subqueries with `ORDER BY` and `HAVING` clauses that refer to outer tables.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to be able to execute SQL queries on the vulnerable MariaDB server.
-  The attacker requires the ability to create databases and tables, and to execute SQL queries against the database to trigger the crash. This could be achieved through having a valid database user account.
-  In some contexts, the attacker may need to have a low privilege account.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `jira.mariadb.org` content provides a specific test case (`fuzz.sql`) for reproducing the bug. It also provides an abortion report that contains the stack trace of the crash.
* The `security.netapp.com` advisory indicates that multiple NetApp products are potentially vulnerable due to the inclusion of MariaDB, and provides a list of affected products that have been identified.
* The vulnerability affects multiple versions of MariaDB, and the content provides the fixed versions, which include 10.6.2, 10.2.39, 10.3.30, 10.4.20, and 10.5.11.
* The `security.netapp.com` advisory assigns a CVSS score of 5.5 (MEDIUM) with a vector of "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H".  Note this score differs from the High score attributed to other related CVE's, that have remote vectors.
