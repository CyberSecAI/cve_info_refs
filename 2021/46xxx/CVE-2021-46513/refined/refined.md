Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- A global buffer overflow occurs in the `mjs_mk_string` function located in `mjs/src/mjs_string.c` at line 58, column 15.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- The primary vulnerability is a **global buffer overflow**. This occurs when the code attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundary of a global buffer.
- The specific location of the overflow is during the creation of a string within the `mjs_mk_string` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- The immediate impact is a crash due to the AddressSanitizer detecting the overflow, as shown in the provided output.
-  A global buffer overflow can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if the overflow overwrites critical data, function pointers, or return addresses.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is through a crafted JavaScript payload that uses `JSON.stringify` in a specific way. The provided `poc.js` file demonstrates how to trigger the overflow using a combination of `JSON.stringify` calls with specific inputs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within the vulnerable `mjs` environment.
- The provided `poc.js` demonstrates that the attacker needs to have knowledge of the specific inputs that cause the overflow.

**More detail than the official CVE description:**

- The provided content offers a significantly more granular view of the vulnerability than a placeholder CVE description. 
- It details the exact file and line number where the overflow occurs, the involved functions (`mjs_mk_string`, `mjs_op_json_stringify`), a specific test case (`poc.js`), and the output from AddressSanitizer, which precisely pinpoints the memory corruption.
- The content gives the exact location of the overflowing buffer in relation to other global variables.
