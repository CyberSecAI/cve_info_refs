- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-use-after-free vulnerability occurs in the `jsi_ValueCopyMove` function in `src/jsiValue.c` at line 245. This is triggered by a specific JavaScript code execution scenario that involves array manipulation and function calls.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core issue is a use-after-free condition. This means a memory location is freed and then accessed again. The vulnerability stems from the way the `jsish` JavaScript interpreter handles object references and garbage collection during complex operations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability leads to a crash of the `jsish` interpreter. In a more malicious context, this could potentially be exploited for denial-of-service or potentially code execution if an attacker could control the memory being reused after free
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specifically crafted javascript file that exploits the vulnerability when executed by the `jsish` interpreter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide malicious input to the `jsish` interpreter. This could involve supplying a malicious javascript file or controlling user input that gets evaluated.
