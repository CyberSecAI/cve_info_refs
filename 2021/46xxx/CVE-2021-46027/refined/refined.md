Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The application lacks Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the blog management section, specifically when adding blog tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The application does not validate the origin of requests to the `/admin/blogTags/add` endpoint. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, executes unintended actions on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can add arbitrary blog tags to the application through a CSRF attack by tricking an authenticated administrator into clicking a malicious link.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Link:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with a form that targets the vulnerable endpoint (`/admin/blogTags/add`).
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker sends the link to an authenticated administrator, possibly through email, instant messaging, or by posting it on a forum or social media.
*   **User Interaction:** When the administrator visits the attacker's page, the malicious form is submitted to the target application without the administrator's knowledge or consent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **External Access:** The attacker only needs external access to be able to craft the malicious webpage.
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs the capability to send the malicious link to an administrator and trick them into clicking it.
*   **No prior authentication on the target application needed:** The attacker only needs to trick an authenticated administrator to perform the action on the attacker's behalf.

**Additional Details (from the content):**
*   The vulnerability was reported on GitHub as issue #40 in the `wangl1989/mysiteforme` repository.
*   The vulnerable endpoint is `POST /admin/blogTags/add`.
*   The attacker provides a basic HTML PoC with a form containing a `name` parameter to add arbitrary tags.
*   The attacker provides a request example showing the lack of CSRF token.
