Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization when adding blog tags. The application accepts user-provided input for blog tags without filtering or encoding special characters, specifically HTML tags, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS. This occurs because the injected script is stored in the database and executed every time a user views the page containing the injected tag.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
- **Account Takeover/Data Theft:** An attacker could potentially steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, deface the website, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is accessible through the web interface of the application, specifically the "add blog tag" functionality in the blog management section.
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a POST request to `/admin/blogTags/add` with a malicious script injected in the "name" parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the blog management section.
- **Web Browser:** A standard web browser is sufficient to execute the attack.
- **Knowledge of Application:** The attacker needs knowledge of the target application's functionality to locate the vulnerable "add blog tag" feature.

**Additional details:**
The report includes the following information:
- **Affected Component:** `POST /admin/blogTags/add`
- **Vulnerable parameter:** `name`
- **Payload:**  `<script>alert("XSS")</script>` injected in the name parameter of the POST request
- **Screenshots:** Screenshots showing the successful XSS execution

The provided information clearly demonstrates the stored XSS vulnerability and provides the necessary details to understand how it can be exploited.
