The provided content is related to CVE-2021-46749.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Insufficient bounds checking in the AMD Secure Processor (ASP) during System Management Interface (SMI) mailbox checksum calculation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Out-of-bounds read vulnerability in SMI mailbox checksum calculation due to lack of proper bounds checking.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A data abort is triggered, potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered through the SMI mailbox interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to influence the SMI mailbox interface to trigger the out-of-bounds read. This often requires some form of privileged access or ability to load a malicious ABL/UApp or to compromise the SMM.

**Additional Details:**
The content provides specific AGESA versions that mitigate the vulnerability for various AMD processors and platforms.
The document also acknowledges that this vulnerability was internally reported.
