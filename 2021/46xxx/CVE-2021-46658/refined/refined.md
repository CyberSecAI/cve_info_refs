Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46658:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The provided content from `jira.mariadb.org` directly references `CVE-2021-46658` within the "Issue Links" section, confirming that the issue tracked by `MDEV-25630` is related to this CVE. The content from `mariadb.com` also lists `CVE-2021-46658` along with the affected MariaDB versions.  The content from `security.netapp.com` also lists CVE-2021-46658 as an affected vulnerability in their products. Therefore, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Analysis**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a crash related to the use of a window function in the left-hand expression of an `IN` subquery. This suggests a flaw in the query optimizer or the execution logic when handling specific combinations of window functions and subqueries.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  The primary weakness lies in the MariaDB query optimizer's handling of complex queries involving window functions within subqueries.  Specifically, the issue is with how it processes a window function used as the left operand of an `IN` operator within a subquery. This could point to an unhandled edge case that leads to a crash.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The impact of this vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, which results in an unexpected server crash and service disruption.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting specific SQL queries that include a window function in the left expression of an `IN` subquery.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs the ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries against a vulnerable MariaDB instance. This typically implies having some level of access to the database server, such as through a database client or an application that interacts with the database.
    *   The attacker doesn't need elevated privileges necessarily but does need the ability to execute crafted queries.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   The `jira.mariadb.org` content provides more technical detail by giving the specific MariaDB versions affected and how to repeat the bug with a `fuzz.sql` example, along with the abortion report, thus enabling reproduction and verification of the bug.
*   The `mariadb.com` content provides a high-level list of fixed CVEs within different MariaDB versions. It also offers a way to report security issues directly to MariaDB.
*   The `security.netapp.com` content confirms that multiple NetApp products are affected by this CVE due to their usage of MariaDB and that successful exploitation could lead to a DoS. They also provide the CVSS score for the vulnerability.
