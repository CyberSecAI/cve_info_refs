      "vulnerability": "The commit addresses a vulnerability in the X.509 certificate verification process. The verifier would sometimes discard an error on an unvalidated certificate chain if a verification callback was in use and instructed the verifier to continue unconditionally. This could lead to incorrect decisions in software, essentially bypassing authentication when it should have failed.",
