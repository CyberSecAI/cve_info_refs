Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-46652:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Bentley View parses DGN files. Specifically, the parsing process contains a flaw that allows for writing data past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: Crafted data within a DGN file can trigger a write operation beyond the allocated memory buffer. This is due to a flaw in parsing the file format.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: By exploiting this out-of-bounds write vulnerability, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, giving the attacker control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious DGN files: The attack vector involves using a specially crafted DGN file containing malicious data designed to trigger the out-of-bounds write vulnerability when opened by a vulnerable application.
- User Interaction: The user needs to open a malicious DGN file or visit a malicious page in order to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious DGN file.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious DGN file with a vulnerable version of Bentley View.
- No special privileges are required, as the vulnerability is triggered during normal file parsing.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
- The vulnerability affects Bentley View and MicroStation (mentioned in the Bentley advisory).
- The vulnerability is addressed in Bentley View and MicroStation versions 10.16.02.* and later.
- The vendor recommends updating to the latest versions and to only open DGN files from trusted sources.
