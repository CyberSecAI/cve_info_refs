| Simplified test case:  ``` function assertThrows() { 	throw new Error; }  Function.prototype[Symbol.hasInstance].call({}, { 	"getPrototypeOf": assertThrows }); ``` |

| We have a fix for this pending. It should be available next week.  The crash was because `Function.prototype[ @@hasInstance ]` didn't check to see if `this` was callable. In fixing that, we noticed that the steps for the implementation were incorrect for bound functions, which was a conformance issue. That will be fixed as well. Excellent discovery. Thank you! |
