Based on the provided information, both issues #767 and #748 are related to the same root cause and vulnerability in `fx_Function_prototype_hasInstance`. Issue #767 was identified as a duplicate of #748. The following information is based on the details provided for issue #748 as it has more detailed analysis.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `Function.prototype[@@hasInstance]` implementation did not check if `this` was callable, leading to a null pointer dereference when `this` was not a function.
- Additionally, the implementation had incorrect steps for bound functions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference vulnerability in `fx_Function_prototype_hasInstance` when `this` is not a function.
- Incorrect implementation of `Function.prototype[@@hasInstance]` for bound functions, which is a conformance issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The null pointer dereference leads to a segmentation fault (SEGV) causing the program to crash.
- The vulnerability can be triggered in both debug and release builds of the software.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by calling `Function.prototype[Symbol.hasInstance].call` with a non-callable object as the `this` value and an object with a `getPrototypeOf` property as an argument.
- Specifically, the provided test case used `Function.prototype[Symbol.hasInstance].call({}, { "getPrototypeOf": assertThrows });` where `{}` is not callable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code in an environment using the vulnerable Moddable XS engine.
- The attacker needs to craft a specific call to `Function.prototype[Symbol.hasInstance]` with specific arguments to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The fix implemented checks if `this` is callable before dereferencing it in `fx_Function_prototype_hasInstance`.
- The fix also corrects the implementation for bound functions to ensure proper conformance.
- The issue was found using AddressSanitizer, which detected the null pointer dereference.
