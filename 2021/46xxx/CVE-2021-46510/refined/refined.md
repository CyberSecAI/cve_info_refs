- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An assertion failure in the garbage collector (`gc_mark_string` function) of the mjs JavaScript engine. The assertion `s < mjs->owned_strings.buf + mjs->owned_strings.len` failed, indicating that the garbage collector is attempting to access memory outside of the bounds of the owned strings buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds memory access due to a flaw in the garbage collector logic when handling strings.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The assertion failure leads to an abort of the program, which constitutes a denial-of-service. It is possible this could be leveraged for more serious vulnerabilities such as RCE, but this was not demonstrated.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by executing a specific JavaScript code that involves string manipulation and garbage collection. The provided `poc.js` file demonstrates such a code snippet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code using the vulnerable `mjs` engine.
