- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a heap-use-after-free error in the `jsi_wswebsocketObjFree` function, located in `src/jsiWebSocket.c` at line 3190.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A heap-use-after-free vulnerability occurs when memory is accessed after it has been freed. In this case, a WebSocket object is freed, and then an attempt is made to access it.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution. The provided output shows a crash caused by AddressSanitizer detecting the use-after-free.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the use of the `WebSocket` object within the `jsish` environment, specifically when the garbage collection or object destruction occurs. The provided test case demonstrates this.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute `jsish` code, and be able to create and interact with `WebSocket` objects.

The provided content gives more specific details about the vulnerability, including the exact line of code where the issue arises, the memory address being accessed after being freed, and the call stack of the error.
