The provided content is related to CVE-2021-46348.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from setting `Object.prototype.__proto__` to a Proxy object that returns an array on `getPrototypeOf` calls, which leads to circular referencing in the prototype chain and ultimately triggers an assertion failure during garbage collection within JerryScript.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Circular prototype chain due to the ability to set `Object.prototype.__proto__` to a proxy.
- Assertion failure during garbage collection.
- Internal error `ERR_FAILED_INTERNAL_ASSERTION` and program termination due to the assertion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) due to program termination caused by the assertion failure.
- Potential for further exploitation due to the memory corruption issues.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through crafted JavaScript code that sets `Object.prototype.__proto__` to a proxy that creates a circular chain.
- The provided proof of concept code (`poc.js`) demonstrates how to trigger the issue.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute crafted JavaScript code within the vulnerable JerryScript environment.
