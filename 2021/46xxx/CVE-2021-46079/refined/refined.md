**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-46079

**Root Cause:** Unrestricted file upload vulnerability

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The application allows unrestricted file uploads in multiple locations.
*   Lack of proper input validation and sanitization on uploaded files.

    *   My Account (/admin/?page=user) - Avatar upload
    *   User List (/admin/?page=user/manage\_user) - Avatar upload
    *   Settings-System Logo (/admin/?page=system\_info) - System Logo upload
    *   Settings-Website Cover (/admin/?page=system\_info) - Website Cover upload
*   The uploaded file, when accessed, executes the embedded HTML.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have valid admin credentials to log in to the admin panel.
*   The attacker must be able to upload files through the web interface.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Sourcecodester Vehicle Service Management System 1.0
