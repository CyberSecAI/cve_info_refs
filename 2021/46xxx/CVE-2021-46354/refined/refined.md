The provided content is related to CVE-2021-46354.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecure external service interaction within Thinfinity VirtualUI. The application can be induced to interact with an arbitrary external service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is the core vulnerability.
- The application allows user-controlled input (`destAddr`) to influence the destination of server-side requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious actor can trigger the vulnerable server to send requests to arbitrary external endpoints.
- This can be used to:
    - Filtrate the real IP address of the webserver, even if it's behind a CDN or other security layers.
    - Increase the attack surface by probing or interacting with other internal systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP request to the application.
- The attacker crafts a malicious request that includes a `destAddr` parameter, specifying the external endpoint they want the server to interact with.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Thinfinity VirtualUI server.
- The attacker does not require prior authentication or any special privileges.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `destAddr`.
- The vulnerable versions mentioned are: VirtualUI version 2.1.28.0, 2.1.32.1 and 2.5.26.2.
- The specific endpoint is not explicitly stated, but it involves the `cmd` parameter (e.g., `.../cmd?cmd=connect...`).
- The attacker can specify the target domain in the `destAddr` parameter.
- Example HTTP request: `https://example.com/cmd?cmd=connect&wscompression=true&destAddr=domain.com&scraper=fmx&screenWidth=1918&screenHeight=934&fitmode=0&argumentsp=&orientation=0&browserWidth=1918&browserHeight=872&supportCur=true&id=null&devicePixelRatio=1&isMobile=false&isLandscape=true&supportsFullScreen=true&webapp=false`
