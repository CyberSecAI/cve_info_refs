The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in MCMS, an open-source CMS project. However, the CVE ID `CVE-2021-46037` is not mentioned in the content, nor is any specific vulnerability described by this CVE referenced.
The identified vulnerabilities are:

**1. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root cause:** Insufficient input sanitization in the `/ms/template/unzip.do` endpoint.
*   **Weakness:** The application reflects user-supplied input in the response without proper encoding, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, and other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted request to the `/ms/template/unzip.do` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `fileUrl` parameter.
*   **Required capabilities:** The attacker needs to convince a user to click on a malicious link.

**2. Authorized File Upload to Remote Code Execution (RCE)**
*   **Root Cause:** The application allows authorized users to upload files to the server without sufficient validation.
*   **Weakness:** The application does not properly sanitize uploaded files, allowing an attacker to upload malicious files that can be executed by the server.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*  **Attack Vector:** Uploading a malicious file via the `/ms/file/uploadTemplate.do` endpoint.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Attacker needs valid login credentials.

**3. Unauthorized File Upload to RCE**
*   **Root cause:** The application allows unauthenticated users to upload files through the `/file/upload` endpoint.
*   **Weakness:** The application lacks proper authentication and authorization for file uploads, allowing an attacker to bypass security controls. Additionally, the application filters `.jsp` files, but fails to prevent `.jspx` uploads, which are also executable in Tomcat.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can upload arbitrary code and execute it on the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to the `/file/upload.do` endpoint with a malicious `.jspx` file.
*   **Required Capabilities:** No authentication is required.

**4. Authorized File Delete**
*  **Root Cause:** The application does not validate the file path during delete operations
*   **Weakness:** The application allows authorized users to delete arbitrary files.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server.
*  **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted GET request to the `/ms/template/unZip.do` endpoint with a malicious `fileUrl` parameter.
*  **Required Capabilities:** Attacker needs valid login credentials.

These vulnerabilities provide attackers with various attack vectors, including XSS, unauthorized file upload leading to RCE and authorized file deletion.
