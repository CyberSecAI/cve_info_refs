The provided content relates to a crash in the `mjs` JavaScript engine, specifically a segmentation fault (SEGV) at `src/mjs_exec.c:823` within the `mjs_execute` function. This crash is triggered by a crafted JavaScript code snippet. Although the provided content does not explicitly state a CVE is assigned it is a detailed bug report and a strong candidate for one.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A crafted JavaScript code snippet involving nested `splice` calls on an array causes a segmentation fault during execution within the `mjs` JavaScript engine's execution logic.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A memory access violation, likely a null pointer dereference, caused by the engine's handling of the nested splice calls.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability leads to a crash of the JavaScript engine (segfault), potentially causing a denial of service.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is execution of specially crafted JavaScript code, specifically using nested `splice` array operations which cause a memory access violation.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to supply and execute the malicious javascript code with the vulnerable `mjs` engine.

The provided content gives more details than what would typically be available in a CVE description, including the specific line of code causing the crash, the stack trace, and a proof of concept javascript file.
