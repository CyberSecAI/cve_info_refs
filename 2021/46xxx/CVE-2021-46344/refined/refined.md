The content is related to CVE-2021-46344.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by an assertion failure in the `parser_parse_object_initializer` function within the JerryScript engine. This occurs when the parser encounters a rest element in an object destructuring pattern, but the scanner info required to properly handle the rest element is not available due to an invalid destructuring pattern.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is the lack of proper handling for rest elements in destructuring patterns when scanner info is missing, leading to an assertion failure. This exposes an internal assert in debug builds, which can be triggered using a crafted javascript code.

**Impact of exploitation:** The immediate impact is a crash of the JerryScript engine due to the assertion failure. This could lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the execution of specially crafted JavaScript code containing an object destructuring pattern with a rest element that triggers the assertion.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within an environment running the vulnerable version of JerryScript.
