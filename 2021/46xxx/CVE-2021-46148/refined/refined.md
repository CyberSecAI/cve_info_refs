Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stemmed from the fact that the `electionadmin` user group on testwiki, which was introduced to facilitate testing of the SecurePoll extension, inadvertently granted users access to Personal Identifiable Information (PII) of voters. This occurred because members of the `electionadmin` group, when also designated as admins of a specific election, could view voter IP addresses and user agents. The issue was exacerbated by the fact that testwiki bureaucrats could grant users this group membership, effectively allowing users without the necessary NDA to access PII.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The `electionadmin` group granted access to PII without a specific check to ensure the user was authorized to view such information.
*   **Overly Broad Permissions:** Bureaucrats on testwiki had the ability to grant the `electionadmin` group membership, extending the potential for unauthorized access.
*   **Lack of Explicit Right:** The SecurePoll extension didn't have a specific right that clearly indicated access to PII, which made the implication less obvious.
*   **Missing Logging:** There was no logging of access to private information via SecurePoll.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Unauthorized users could view the IP addresses and user agents of voters, potentially leading to deanonymization.
*   **Privacy Violation:** Accessing PII of voters without proper authorization is a violation of user privacy.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A user could be granted the `electionadmin` group membership by a testwiki bureaucrat, without the need for an NDA or special authorization.
*   **Direct Access:** A user with the `electionadmin` group membership and election admin status could directly access the voter PII via the SecurePoll interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Testwiki Account:** The attacker needed an account on testwiki.
*   **`electionadmin` Group Membership:** The attacker needed to be a member of the `electionadmin` user group, which could be granted by bureaucrats.
*   **Election Admin Status:** The attacker had to be added as an admin to a particular election to view its voter PII.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was addressed by:

1.  **Removing `electionadmin` group from testwiki:** Immediately removing the problematic user group from testwiki to prevent further access.
2.  **Introducing `securepoll-view-voter-pii` Right:** A new user right, `securepoll-view-voter-pii`, was introduced, which is now required to view voter PII. This right is separate from the `electionadmin` group membership.
3.  **Patching SecurePoll:** The SecurePoll extension was patched to enforce the new `securepoll-view-voter-pii` right.
4.  **Granting the new right on votewiki:** Election admins on votewiki were granted the `securepoll-view-voter-pii` right.
5.  **Code Review:** Patches were reviewed and merged to different branches of the SecurePoll extension.
6.  **Cosmetic Fix:** The order of columns in the voter list was restored to the original layout.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was discovered by internal users who alerted the appropriate teams, and a security patch was quickly deployed.
*   The team also discussed the need to audit user rights that grant access to PII and the creation of a process for becoming an election admin on testwiki.
*   There were discussions of alternative solutions, such as hosting SecurePoll on a Cloud VPS to circumvent the testwiki access management issues.
*   The incident highlighted the importance of clear communication about the permissions granted by user groups and rights, especially those that involve access to PII.
