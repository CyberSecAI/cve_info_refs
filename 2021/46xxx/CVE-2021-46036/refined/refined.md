The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in MCMS, an open-source CMS project. These vulnerabilities include reflected XSS, authorized file upload to RCE, unauthorized file upload to RCE, and authorized file delete.

**1. Reflected XSS**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of user-supplied input in the `/ms/template/unzip.do` path. Specifically, the `fileUrl` parameter is not sanitized before being reflected in the response.
*   **Weakness:**  Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or defacement.
*  **Attack Vector:** The attacker sends a crafted URL with a malicious payload in the `fileUrl` parameter to a victim. When the victim visits the URL, the malicious script is executed in their browser.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to get the victim to click a crafted URL.

**2. Authorized File Upload to RCE**

*   **Root Cause:** The application allows authorized users to upload files via the `/ms/file/uploadTemplate.do` path.
*   **Weakness:**  Unrestricted file upload.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker with valid user credentials can upload a malicious file, like a JSPX webshell, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker with valid user credentials uploads a malicious file via the `/ms/file/uploadTemplate.do` path.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs valid user credentials to access the upload functionality.

**3. Unauthorized File Upload to RCE**

*   **Root Cause:** The application allows unauthorized users to upload files via the `/file/upload.do` path. The system filters `.jsp` files but fails to filter other executable files like `.jspx`, allowing for bypass of the file extension block list.
*   **Weakness:**  Unrestricted file upload due to insufficient file extension validation/filtering.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can upload a malicious file (e.g., a JSPX webshell) without any authentication, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends a POST request to `/file/upload.do` with a malicious JSPX file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker requires network access to the server but does not require authentication.

**4. Authorized File Delete**

*   **Root Cause:** The application allows authorized users to delete files using a request to the `/ms/template/unZip.do` path.
*   **Weakness:** Insecure direct object reference.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can potentially delete arbitrary files by manipulating the `fileUrl` parameter.
*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker sends a GET request to `/ms/template/unZip.do` with a crafted `fileUrl` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs valid user credentials to access the delete functionality.
