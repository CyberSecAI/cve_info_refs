| Hi folks,  An interesting crash was found while fuzz testing of the mesh2poly binary which can be triggered via a malformed mesh file. Although the below malformed file only crashes the program as-is, it could potentially be crafted further and create a security issue where these kinds of files would be able compromise the process's memory through taking advantage of affordances given by memory corruption. It's recommend to harden the code to prevent these kinds of bugs as it could greatly mitigate such this issue and even future bugs.  **crash.mesh** (create file from scratch, no magic bytes necessary)  ``` echo -ne `perl -e 'print "B" x 2176'` > test.mesh  ```  **debug log**  ``` (gdb) r test.mesh /tmp/empty.mesh The program being debugged has been started already.

| An interesting crash was found while fuzz testing of the mesh2poly binary which can be triggered via a malformed mesh file. Although the below malformed file only crashes the program as-is, it could potentially be crafted further and create a security issue where these kinds of files would be able compromise the process's memory through taking advantage of affordances given by memory corruption. It's recommend to harden the code to prevent these kinds of bugs as it could greatly mitigate such this issue and even future bugs.  Hi, thanks for pointing that out. I protected all string reading with a maximum string size smaller than my buffer size. Your fuzz testing is now correctly handled. Regards, Loïc |
