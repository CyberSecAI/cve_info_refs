Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-46067

**Root Cause:** Insufficient validation of file uploads within the Vehicle Service Management System, allowing an attacker to upload a malicious HTML file containing JavaScript code that steals cookies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system allows users to upload files, including HTML files, without proper validation. This allows an attacker to upload a file containing malicious JavaScript.
*   **Cookie Stealing (via XSS):** The malicious HTML file contains JavaScript that uses `document.cookie` to access session cookies and sends them to an attacker-controlled server (using a webhook). This is a form of reflected cross-site scripting, triggered by opening the uploaded file in a browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Full Account Takeover:** By stealing the `PHPSESSID` cookie, an attacker can impersonate a legitimate user and gain full access to the application, including administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a specially crafted HTML file through the avatar upload function (My Account, User List, Settings)
*   **Web Browser:** The victim's browser executes the uploaded HTML/JavaScript, sending the victim's cookies to the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to the application:** The attacker must be able to log in to the admin panel of the Vehicle Service Management System.
*   **Ability to upload files:** The attacker needs the ability to upload files to the avatar or logo/cover photo upload feature.
*   **Webhook Server:** The attacker needs a server to receive the stolen cookies (in the example it is using webhook.site).

**Specific Vulnerable Locations**
The vulnerability can be exploited via the following application features:
1.  **My Account (/admin/?page=user):** Uploading the malicious HTML file as an avatar.
2.  **User List (/admin/?page=user/manage\_user):** Uploading the malicious HTML file as an avatar when creating a new user.
3.  **Settings-System Logo (/admin/?page=system\_info):** Uploading the malicious HTML file as the system logo.
4.  **Settings-Website Cover (/admin/?page=system\_info):** Uploading the malicious HTML file as the website cover.

**Mitigation:**
The provided text recommends:
*   **File Upload Validation:** Validate file uploads to prevent uploading of executable files like HTML.
*   **Secondary Session Checks:** Implement secondary checks in session management to detect and prevent session hijacking.

**Additional Notes:**
* The exploit uses `onerror` event handler on an image element to execute the Javascript, which is a common technique for XSS attacks.
* The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the Vehicle Service Management System.
* The attacker utilizes a third-party webhook service (`webhook.site`) to receive the stolen cookies.
* The vulnerability is rated as a **9.8 CRITICAL** severity.
