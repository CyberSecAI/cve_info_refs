The provided content describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in mblog version 3.5.0 and earlier.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application lacks proper CSRF protection in the background article management, specifically when deleting articles.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability in the `/admin/post/delete` endpoint.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick an administrator into deleting articles by clicking a malicious link.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious link is crafted and sent to the administrator, exploiting the lack of CSRF protection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted link to an authenticated administrator. They also must know the structure of the URL to delete an article, namely the endpoint and the `id` parameter. The administrator needs to be logged into the mblog application for the attack to succeed.
