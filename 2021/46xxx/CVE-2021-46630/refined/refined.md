Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of FBX files within Bentley View. This lack of validation leads to a read operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, where the software attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer when processing a specially crafted FBX file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exploiting the out-of-bounds read can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from the application's memory.
*   **Potential Code Execution:** The advisory indicates that this vulnerability, in conjunction with other vulnerabilities, could be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious FBX File:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious FBX file.
*   **User Interaction:** The target user must open the malicious FBX file using an affected version of Bentley View.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted FBX file.
*   The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious FBX file.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Bentley View versions prior to 10.16.02.*
*   Bentley released a fix in version 10.16.02.* and later.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
