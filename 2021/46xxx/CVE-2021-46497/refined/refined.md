The provided content describes a heap-use-after-free vulnerability in the `jsish` project, specifically in the `jsi_UserObjDelete` function at `src/jsiUserObj.c:32`.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A use-after-free condition occurs when the code attempts to access memory that has already been freed. The issue is specifically triggered within the `jsi_UserObjDelete` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-use-after-free.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability can lead to a crash due to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution. In the provided crash output, the program terminates with an AddressSanitizer error.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves calling certain functions or operations in a way that triggers the vulnerability. In this instance, the provided test case utilizes a combination of `WebSocket(new Object())` and `(Number)('wrong')` within try/catch blocks to expose the issue.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to execute specially crafted JavaScript code within the `jsish` environment.

The provided content gives more specific detail than a generic CVE description might, including the specific line of code where the error occurs, the call stack leading to the crash, and a sample test case.
