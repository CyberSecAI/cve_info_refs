The provided content is related to a bug report for JerryScript, specifically issue #4935. The issue arises from an assertion failure related to invalid CESU-8 string encoding.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the incorrect handling of UTF-8 encoded strings that are not valid CESU-8. The parser expects UTF-8 characters in the basic multilingual plane to be encoded with 3 bytes, but it encounters a 4-byte sequence instead, which it misinterprets during the conversion to CESU-8.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   Improper input validation of UTF-8 strings during conversion to CESU-8.
-   Assertion failure instead of a user-friendly error message.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   Program termination due to the assertion failure
-  Denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
-  Providing a crafted JavaScript string with invalid UTF-8 encoding that doesn't match the expected CESU-8. Specifically, providing a 4-byte UTF-8 sequence where a 3-byte sequence is expected.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide Javascript code to be processed by JerryScript, which contains a malformed UTF-8 string.
