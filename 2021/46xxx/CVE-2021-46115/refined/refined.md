Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-46115

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an insecure template upload functionality within the JPress backend. Although there is some filtering, it's insufficient to prevent exploitation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Template Upload:** The JPress backend allows users to upload templates, and this functionality does not adequately sanitize or validate the uploaded files.
*   **Fastjson Deserialization Vulnerability:** The exploit leverages `fastjson` to deserialize a malicious payload. This payload abuses `com.alibaba.fastjson.parser.ParserConfig` and `javax.script.ScriptEngineManager` to achieve remote code execution.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The filtering mechanisms in place do not block the malicious use of `fastjson` to load and execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting JPress. This can lead to complete compromise of the server and the JPress application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Template Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious template file (.html or similar) containing the crafted payload to the JPress backend.
*   **Access to JPress Backend:** The attacker needs to have access to the JPress admin panel to upload the malicious template file. The github issue mentions that this was done using a weak password

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the JPress Admin Panel:** The attacker must have administrative or at least the necessary privileges to upload a new template.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Payloads:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a payload that abuses fastjson to execute arbitrary code using `ScriptEngineManager`.

**Technical Details of Exploit**

The attacker uploads a template containing the following payload using fastjson:
```
#set(x=com.alibaba.fastjson.parser.ParserConfig::getGlobalInstance())
#(x.setAutoTypeSupport(true))
#(x.addAccept("javax.script.ScriptEngineManager"))
#set(x=com.alibaba.fastjson.JSON::parse('{"@type":"javax.script.ScriptEngineManager"}'))
#set(e=x.getEngineByName("js"))
#(e.eval('java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec("calc")'))
```
This code uses the `fastjson` library to create a `ScriptEngineManager` which can be used to execute arbitrary javascript code. The payload shown in the example executes the command calc (calculator), proving that code execution is possible.

**Mitigation**

The github issue states this vulnerability was resolved in the latest version.
