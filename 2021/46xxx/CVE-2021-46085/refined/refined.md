{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure Permissions vulnerability exists in OneBlog which allows low-level administrators to delete higher-level administrators beyond their authority by manipulating the 'ids' parameter in the POST request to `/user/remove`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure Permissions, Lack of proper access control, Insufficient validation of user roles and permissions before deletion.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Low-level administrators can delete high-level administrators, including the highest authority administrators, leading to potential disruption of service, unauthorized access, and data loss. Attackers could also delete any user including themselves.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `/user/remove` endpoint with a modified `ids` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have a low-level administrator account to log in to the system and access the user management page. They can then use the browser or tools like Burp Suite to craft the malicious request."
