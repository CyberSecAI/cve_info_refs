Any administrator can add, delete, modify and query the data of other administrator users by modifying the IDS value）  [Attack Type] Remote  [Vulnerability details]  first, prepare two test accounts with different levels.

This is a logical vulnerability because the default secondary rule of the system is that you cannot delete yourself)  The first step is to log in to the background with root123 account and enter user management.

Here, I modify the value of IDS to the value of the currently logged in user.
