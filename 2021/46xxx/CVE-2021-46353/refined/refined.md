Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46353:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is related to an "Unauthenticated Information Leakage via Error Message." This suggests that the device leaks sensitive information through error messages that are accessible without authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The primary weakness is the exposure of potentially sensitive data through error messages.
*   **Lack of Proper Error Handling:** The device's error handling mechanisms are not properly configured to avoid disclosing internal system details.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** This vulnerability is exploitable without requiring prior authentication, making it easier to exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information that could be valuable for further attacks.
*   This information could potentially expose configuration details or internal workings of the device.
*   The leaked information could be used to launch more targeted attacks on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack can be carried out by sending specially crafted requests to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the device or have the ability to reach the device through the network.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by multiple researchers, as mentioned in the announcement.
*   A patch (v1.10WWB09_Beta) has been released to address this vulnerability and other issues.
*   The affected models are D-Link DIR-X1860 with all Ax hardware revisions running firmware version 1.03 and below.
