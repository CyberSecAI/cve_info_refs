The provided content contains details about a vulnerability in MCMS, a content management system, specifically an unauthorized file upload vulnerability. This vulnerability is described in the context of a Gitee issue report and is related to CVE-2021-46386 based on the associated issue number being mentioned.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an unprotected file upload endpoint in `net.mingsoft.basic.action.web.FileAction#upload`. This endpoint lacks proper authorization checks.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The `upload` method only restricts files with `.jsp` and `.exe` extensions, allowing other file types, including executable files like `.jspx`, to be uploaded.
    *   **Lack of Authorization:** The file upload endpoint is accessible without authentication, meaning anyone can use it to upload files.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can upload malicious files, such as a JSPX webshell, to the server. If the application is deployed in a Tomcat environment (or a similar servlet container), the attacker can then execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to full compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the `/file/upload` endpoint, which can be accessed through HTTP requests.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. They need to be able to craft an HTTP request to send a malicious file.

The attacker would have to:

1. Access the `/file/upload` endpoint without authorization.
2.  Upload a malicious file, such as a jspx webshell, taking advantage of the insufficient file extension blacklist.
3.  Access the malicious file that is now stored on the server.
