- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper ICMP packet processing in Huawei routers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Traffic hijacking due to insufficient handling of ICMP packets.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to packet hijacking by attackers, potentially allowing them to intercept and manipulate network traffic.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker on the LAN constructs and sends malicious ICMP packets to the victim router.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have network access within the same LAN as the vulnerable router.
