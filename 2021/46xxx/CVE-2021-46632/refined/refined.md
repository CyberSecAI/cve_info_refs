Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing JP2 image files. Specifically, the issue lies in how Bentley View handles JP2 image data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:**  The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, where the software attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer, when parsing maliciously crafted JP2 files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read sensitive information from the application's memory.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The advisory mentions that this vulnerability could be used with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious JP2 Files:** The attack vector involves specially crafted JP2 image files.
*   **User Interaction:** The target user must open a malicious JP2 file using a vulnerable version of Bentley View or visit a malicious page to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to create or obtain a maliciously crafted JP2 file.
*   The attacker must then trick a user into opening this malicious JP2 file with the vulnerable software or visit a page that uses such a file.
