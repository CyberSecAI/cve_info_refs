- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL injection vulnerability in the `id` parameter of the `view_room` page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly sanitize user input when constructing SQL queries, leading to SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to complete account takeover, including administrative accounts.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is accessible through a GET request, by manipulating the `id` parameter of the `view_room` page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. They do not necessarily need to be authenticated.

The provided content gives a detailed description of how the vulnerability can be exploited using the `load_file` function to trigger an interaction with an external domain, confirming the successful injection. It also provides a sample SQL injection payload and links to proof-of-concept exploit information, which is more detailed than the official CVE description (PLACEHOLDER).
