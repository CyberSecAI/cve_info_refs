{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A heap-use-after-free vulnerability occurs due to incorrect reference counting when accessing properties of a JavaScript object, specifically after modifying the prototype of Function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Heap-use-after-free"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can lead to a crash of the application due to memory corruption. It could potentially be leveraged for arbitrary code execution in more complex scenarios.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Crafting specific JavaScript code that modifies the Function prototype and then accesses properties of bound functions."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code in the vulnerable environment."
