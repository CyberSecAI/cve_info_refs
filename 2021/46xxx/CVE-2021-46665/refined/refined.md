Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46665:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is located in `sql/sql_parse.cc` within MariaDB, and it is triggered by incorrect expectations regarding `used_tables`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core issue lies in how MariaDB handles table usage during SQL parsing, leading to a crash.
- The code in `sql_parse.cc` makes incorrect assumptions related to `used_tables`, which is a data structure tracking table references in a query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is an application crash within MariaDB. This will render the database server unavailable for queries until it is restarted, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted SQL query. Specifically, a query that leads to unexpected behavior in how the parser evaluates used tables.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs the ability to submit SQL queries to the MariaDB server. This could be achieved through:
    - Direct access to a database client.
    - SQL injection vulnerabilities in applications connected to the database.
    - Ability to execute queries, regardless of privileges, would be sufficient for exploiting this vulnerability.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing, an automated testing technique.
*   The vulnerability is related to, but distinct from, another crash (MDEV-25634) in the `sql_prepare.cc` file.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is present in MariaDB versions 10.2.43, 10.3.34, 10.4.24, 10.5.15, 10.6.7 and 10.7.3.
*   The vulnerability has a "Blocker" priority in the MariaDB bug tracker.
*   The issue was also identified within Fedora and patched in Fedora 34 and 35 with updates to `mariadb` version 10.5.15-1.fc34 and 10.5.15-1.fc35 respectively.
*   NetApp products using vulnerable versions of MariaDB are also affected.
