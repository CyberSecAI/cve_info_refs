  "CVE-2021-46314": {
    "Description": "There is command injection in HNAP1/control/SetNetworkTomographySettings.php of D-Link Router DIR-846 DIR846A1_FW100A43.bin && DIR846enFW100A53DLA-Retail.bin, and backticks can be used for command injection when judging whether it is a reasonable domain name.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper input sanitization when validating the domain name in the `tomography_ping_address` parameter of the `/HNAP1/SetNetworkTomographySettings` endpoint. The application fails to properly neutralize special characters (backticks) allowing for command injection.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Command Injection",
       "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the router, which can lead to a variety of malicious actions, such as complete device compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service. The provided example demonstrates that the router will reboot upon successful exploitation.",
    "Attack vectors": "HTTP POST request to the `/HNAP1/` endpoint, specifically targeting the `SetNetworkTomographySettings` action. The `tomography_ping_address` parameter is the injection point.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This typically requires network access to the router's LAN (Local Area Network)."
