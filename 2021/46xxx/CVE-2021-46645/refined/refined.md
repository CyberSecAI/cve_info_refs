Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-46645:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the parsing of BMP image files within Bentley MicroStation CONNECT. Specifically, crafted data within a BMP image can cause a write operation beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The software attempts to write data to a memory location outside of the allocated buffer for the BMP image, leading to potential memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running the vulnerable software. This means that the attacker can gain control over the application and, potentially, the system itself.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious BMP file: The attacker crafts a malicious BMP image file.
- User Interaction: The user must open the crafted BMP file using a vulnerable version of Bentley MicroStation CONNECT. This can be through visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious BMP file to the user of the vulnerable software, and the user must open the file.
- No special privileges are needed.
