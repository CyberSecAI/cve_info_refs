Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46668:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is triggered by certain long `SELECT DISTINCT` statements. The specific cause appears to be related to how MariaDB handles a large number of `BLOB` fields in a `SELECT DISTINCT` operation.  The fuzzer-generated SQL, while not provided, highlights this issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Crash:** The primary weakness is a crash or abortion in the MariaDB server (mysqld). This leads to a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Improper Handling of Blobs**: The crash occurs specifically when using "thousands\_blob\_fields" in a `SELECT DISTINCT` query. This suggests improper handling of large data sets within that specific query context.
*   **Memory Corruption**: While not explicitly stated, a crash often suggests some form of memory corruption due to improper data handling

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the MariaDB server to crash, rendering it unavailable.
*  **Data Inconsistency:** In a worst-case scenario, crashes could potentially lead to data inconsistencies in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker with the ability to execute SQL queries against the MariaDB server could craft a malicious `SELECT DISTINCT` statement, including a large number of BLOB fields to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Malicious Application:** An application with a database connection could deliberately execute the problematic query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Database Access:** The attacker needs access to the MariaDB server, be it via network or direct access.
*   **SQL Execution Privileges:** The attacker requires the ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the MariaDB server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must know the specifics required to construct a query triggering this crash.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as a "Blocker" priority bug.
*   It affects versions 10.5.9, and older EOL versions (10.2, 10.3, and 10.4).
*   The fix was applied to versions 10.5.15, 10.6.7, and 10.7.3.
*   The bug was discovered using a fuzzing tool.
*   A simplified `fuzz.sql` file was provided to reproduce the issue
*   A related bug, MDEV-24238 is also mentioned.
* The vulnerability is fixed by the mentioned Fedora updates for multiple versions

This information provides a good technical understanding of the vulnerability, the attack vectors and also how it can be exploited and mitigated.
