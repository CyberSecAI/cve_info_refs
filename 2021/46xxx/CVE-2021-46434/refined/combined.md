| Subject of the issue When a user login, the application returns different results depending on whether the account is correct that allowed an attacker to determine if a given username was valid. Your environment EMQ X 3.x Steps to reproduce The problem lies in the "/api /v3/auth" interface  If you log in using an existing account and the Password is incorrect, "Password Error" is displayed. [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35076979/150079509-0059e80a-26dd-48a2-b4ae-814eb82a107c.png)  and "Username Not Found" is displayed when you log in using a non-existent account.

| Hi [@GYWF](https://github.com/GYWF) !  Thank you for your report!  That version of EMQ X (3.x) is no longer supported. Fortunately, on the latest 4.3.11 (`/api/v4/auth`), that issue is now resolved. Not only you have to be already authenticated to use this API, but the return is the same for both non-existent users and wrong passwords:  ``` $ curl -su 'admin:public' -XPOST http://localhost:8081/api/v4/auth -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "wrongpass"}' | jq . {   "message": "Username/Password error" }  $ curl -su 'admin:public' -XPOST http://localhost:8081/api/v4/auth -d '{"username": "wronguser", "password": "somepass"}' | jq .  {   "message": "Username/Password error" } ```  Please, feel free to open another issue if you find similar problems in the current versions! |
