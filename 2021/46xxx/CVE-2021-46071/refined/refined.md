Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-46071

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the "Category Name" field within the "Category List" section of the Vehicle Service Management System admin panel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores user-supplied data (malicious JavaScript code) without sanitization, allowing it to be executed when the data is later retrieved and displayed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application. This code could potentially:
    - Steal user cookies, potentially leading to account hijacking.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to access the admin panel of the vulnerable application, typically through the web interface.
- **Input Injection:** The attack involves injecting a malicious JavaScript payload into the "Category Name" input field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel of the Vehicle Service Management System.
- The attacker must be able to log in as an administrative user (or have sufficient privileges) to access the Category List section and add new categories.
- The attacker needs basic understanding of XSS attacks and JavaScript.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable Application:** Vehicle Service Management System version 1.0.
- **Vulnerable Component:** The 'Category List' section within the admin panel.
- **Injection Point:**  The 'Category Name' input field.
- **Payload Example:** `" <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`
