| ZZCMS2021\_sqlinject\_1PoC by rerce&rpsateZZCMS the lastest version download page : <http://www.zzcms.net/about/6.html>  software link: <https://github.com/Boomingjacob/ZZCMS/raw/main/zzcms2021.zip> Environmental requirements PHP version > = 4.3.0  Mysql version>=4.0.0 vulnerability code: in file admin/ad\_manage.php line20:  [微信图片_20220119222533](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78201553/150150186-e4557536-5be8-49ad-9004-62f6fa9c7315.png)  As shown in the picture above, parameter b is directly assigned to $b.  [微信图片_20220119222527](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78201553/150150191-f8d4d737-c277-47a8-af3a-07652da96b95.png)  Then, $b is directly spliced into the SQL statement in line 57, which leads to the SQL injection vulnerability.  POC:   1. First log in to the administrator account 2. Visit <http://ip/admin/ad_manage.php?b=A%27%20%26%26%20sleep(5)%23> and intercept with burp. 3. You can see that the delay is 5s.
