The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in ZZCMS2021.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the direct inclusion of the user-controlled parameter `$b` into a SQL query without any sanitization or proper escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the unsanitized user input in the `admin/ad_manage.php` file. Specifically, the `b` parameter is directly used in the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
- In this specific case, the Proof of Concept (PoC) shows a time-based SQL injection where the attacker can force a delay in the server response by injecting a `sleep()` function into the SQL query. This allows an attacker to verify the SQL injection vulnerability is exploitable.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessible through the `ad_manage.php` file located in the `/admin` directory.
- The attack vector is the `b` parameter present in the URL query string.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker can craft a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameter `b`. The PoC demonstrates this via: `http://ip/admin/ad_manage.php?b=A%27%20%26%26%20sleep(5)%23`
