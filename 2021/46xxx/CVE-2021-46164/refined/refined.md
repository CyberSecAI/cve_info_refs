The provided content describes vulnerabilities in the Reports module of ManageEngine Endpoint Central. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

1.  **RCE via Reports module:** Unrestricted access to the Reports module allowed users to execute commands, leading to potential Remote Code Execution (RCE).
2.  **File Path Error:** Incorrect file paths during product startup.
3.  **Sensitive data exposure:** The reports page allowed users to view sensitive database information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:**  Users with complete access to the Reports module could execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Improper File Path Handling:** The software had an error related to file paths during startup.
*   **Lack of Data Sanitization/Access Restrictions:** The report module was not properly preventing users from accessing sensitive database information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Possible instability:** The file path error may have caused issues during startup of the product

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Reports module:** Attackers could use the vulnerable Reports module to execute commands that could lead to RCE.
*   **Product Startup:**  The incorrect file path issue could be exploited during product startup.
*   **Reports Page:** Attackers could access the reports page to view sensitive database tables.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to have access to the ManageEngine Endpoint Central instance.
*   The attacker would need a user account with complete access to the Reports module to exploit the RCE vulnerability and view database data, and simply an account with access to reports to view the sensitive tables.

**Mitigation:**

*   Access to the Reports module has been downgraded to "Read-Only" for all users.
*   The file path error during product startup was fixed using a properly defined path for the invoked executable.
*   Users are now restricted from accessing sensitive database tables through the reports page.

**Note:** The vulnerability is not applicable to the cloud edition of Endpoint Central.
