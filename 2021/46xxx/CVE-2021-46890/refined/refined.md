Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-46890:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Incomplete read and write permission verification in the GPU module.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of read and write permissions within the GPU module.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect service confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This suggests a significant impact, potentially leading to data breaches, system manipulation, or denial-of-service conditions.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability exists within the GPU module of the device's operating system, specifically EMUI 12.0.0. The attack vector would likely involve manipulating GPU related operations to trigger the insufficient permission check.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would likely need the ability to execute code or interact with the vulnerable GPU module. It can be assumed that the attacker is running in a user-space or compromised kernel space environment to interact with the GPU.
