Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in insufficient access controls within the "Reports" module of ManageEngine Endpoint Central. Specifically, users with full access to the Reports module could execute commands that led to Remote Code Execution (RCE) and view sensitive data in the database, and an improperly defined file path caused issues during product startup.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Users with full access to the Reports module could inject and execute commands leading to RCE.
2.  **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The Reports module allowed users to view sensitive data stored in the database.
3. **File Path Error:** An error occurred during product startup due to an incorrect file path for an executable file within batch files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **RCE:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to gain control of the affected system, potentially leading to data breaches, malware installation, and further network compromise.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Access to sensitive data could lead to privacy violations and compromise of business operations.
*   **Product Instability:** Incorrect file path error could cause product malfunction during startup.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the Reports module within the Endpoint Central web interface.
*   An attacker would need an account with access to the Reports module to exploit the vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a valid user account with sufficient privileges to access the Reports module in the affected Endpoint Central installation.
*   The attacker must be able to access the web interface of the Endpoint Central application to exploit the vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities were addressed in Endpoint Central build 10.0.662, released on 03-May-2021.
*   The document credits Tom Ellson for discovering the vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerability is not applicable to the cloud edition of Endpoint Central.
*   The fix involves downgrading the access level of all users to read-only for the Reports module, correcting the file path error, and restricting the access to sensitive database tables.
