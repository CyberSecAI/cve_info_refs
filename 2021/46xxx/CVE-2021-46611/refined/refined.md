Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-46611:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing JP2 image files within Bentley MicroStation and MicroStation-based applications. This results in a read operation past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability. Specifically, the software reads beyond the allocated memory buffer when processing a maliciously crafted JP2 file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  The primary impact is information disclosure due to the out-of-bounds read. An attacker can potentially obtain sensitive information from the application's memory space.
- The advisory from the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) explicitly mentions that this vulnerability, in conjunction with other vulnerabilities, can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- The Bentley advisory indicates that exploiting the vulnerability could lead to code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves opening a maliciously crafted JP2 file using a vulnerable version of MicroStation or a MicroStation-based application.
-  The ZDI advisory also mentions that user interaction is required - the target must either open a malicious file or visit a malicious webpage.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to create or have access to a malicious JP2 file.
- They need to convince a user of a vulnerable application to open the crafted JP2 file.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
- The ZDI advisory identifies this issue as ZDI-22-198 and ZDI-CAN-15405.
- Bentley has released a software update to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS v3.1 score of 7.8 by Bentley (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) and a CVSS v3.0 score of 3.3 by ZDI (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N). The differences in severity score likely reflect that ZDI focused on the out-of-bounds read aspect while Bentley considers the possibility of arbitrary code execution.

This content provides more detail than a basic CVE description by explaining the specific weakness (out-of-bounds read), the file format involved (JP2), the attack vector (malicious file), and the potential for code execution.
