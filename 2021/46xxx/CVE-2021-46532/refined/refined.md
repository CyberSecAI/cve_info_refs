The provided content describes a crash in the `mjs` JavaScript engine, specifically a segmentation fault (SEGV) within the `src/mjs_exec.c` file at line 347, in the `exec_expr` function. This issue was reported by user `hope-fly`.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause appears to be related to how the `mjs` engine handles specific operations involving `NaN`, `undefined`, and potentially object property assignments within loops. The provided test cases demonstrate that assigning values to properties of built-in objects like `isNaN` and `JSON.stringify` along with operations involving `undefined`, followed by setting `length` property to `undefined`, leads to a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption due to incorrect handling of object property assignments, especially when dealing with built-in objects like `isNaN` and `JSON.stringify`.
- Inconsistent handling of `undefined` values in arithmetic and assignment operations.
- Improper handling of `length` property when it is assigned `undefined`, leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service due to the application crashing.
- Potential for memory corruption, which could lead to other exploitable conditions if the engine were integrated into a larger system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation is achieved by providing crafted JavaScript code to the `mjs` engine that triggers the vulnerable conditions described above.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute malicious JavaScript code on the `mjs` engine. This could be achieved in scenarios where the engine is used to parse and execute JavaScript from potentially untrusted sources.
