Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization of the `$this->uri->segment(3)` parameter within the `cszcms\controllers\Member.php#viewUser` function. This parameter, which is user-controlled, is directly used in a SQL query without proper filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a boolean-based SQL injection. The attacker can inject SQL code through the URI segment, allowing them to manipulate the database queries.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not filter or sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the URI segment, before using it in a database query.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can extract sensitive information from the database by crafting specific SQL injection payloads. In this case, the attacker is using `length(database())` to infer the database name length.
- **Potential for further compromise:** With successful SQL injection, an attacker could gain more control over the database which could lead to further exploitation such as data modification, or even full system compromise depending on the database permissions and the application.

**Attack vectors:**

- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL request that includes malicious SQL code in the URI segment. Specifically, the attack exploits the `/member/viewUser/` endpoint by appending a malicious SQL payload as the third URI segment.
- **User Interaction:**  The vulnerability requires the user to be logged in, indicating that the attack is only possible on authenticated users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a registered and logged-in user of the application to access the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Knowledge of application structure:** The attacker needs to know the structure of the vulnerable URL endpoint to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Basic SQL knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL syntax and common functions to create appropriate injection payloads.
