Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46463:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a type confusion bug in how njs (the NGINX JavaScript engine) handles promises. Specifically, the `njs_promise_perform_then()` function, which implements `PerformPromiseThen()`, incorrectly assumes that its first argument is always a promise instance. This assumption is violated because the functions corresponding to `Promise.prototype.then()` and `Promise.resolve()` incorrectly verify their arguments.
*   The code was incorrectly identifying a promise by checking if an object was a `Promise` or had a `Promise` object in its prototype chain. This is wrong because internal slots are not inherited according to the specification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Type Confusion:** The core weakness is a type confusion error. The code expects a promise object but might receive a different object type, which leads to unexpected behavior.
*   **Incorrect Argument Verification:** Functions such as `Promise.prototype.then()` and `Promise.resolve()` incorrectly verify their arguments, allowing non-promise objects to be processed as promises.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure, Data Modification, or Denial of Service:** The NetApp advisory states that successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or denial of service (DoS). The specific impact might depend on how the type confusion manifests.
*  The github commit message says: "Previously, the internal function njs_promise_perform_then() which implements PerformPromiseThen() expects its first argument to always be a promise instance. This assertion might be invalid because the functions corresponding to Promise.prototype.then() and Promise.resolve() incorrectly verified their arguments."

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based, indicated by the CVSS vector `AV:N` (Network).
* An attacker could trigger the vulnerability by crafting malicious input that exploits the incorrect argument verification in the JavaScript code which makes use of the NGINX `njs` module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** An attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability, indicated by `PR:N` (None).
*   **No User Interaction Required:** The attack can be performed without user interaction, indicated by `UI:N` (None).
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected service, `AV:N`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves correcting the argument verification in `njs_promise_resolve()` and `njs_promise_prototype_then()` to properly identify promise objects.
*   The provided GitHub commit includes test cases (`promise_prototype_reject_type_confusion.t.js` and `promise_prototype_then_type_confusion.t.js`) that highlight the type confusion problem.
*   The NetApp advisory states that the vulnerability affects NetApp Cloud Backup OST Plug-in (formerly AltaVault OST Plug-in).
*   There are no workarounds available.
*   NetApp has assigned this issue the advisory ID NTAP-20220303-0007.

**CVSS Score:**

*   The provided CVSS score is 9.8 (CRITICAL) with a vector of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`. This indicates a highly critical vulnerability with a high likelihood of exploitation resulting in high impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
