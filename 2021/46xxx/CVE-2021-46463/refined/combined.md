```
Previously, the internal function njs_promise_perform_then() which
implements PerformPromiseThen() expects its first argument to always be
a promise instance.  This assertion might be invalid because the
functions corresponding to Promise.prototype.then() and
Promise.resolve() incorrectly verified their arguments.

Specifically, the functions recognized their first argument as promise
if it was an object which was an Promise or had Promise object in its
prototype chain.  The later condition is not correct because internal
slots are not inherited according to the spec.

This closes [#447](https://github.com/nginx/njs/issues/447) issue in Github.
