Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-46795:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   A Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability exists.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a race condition between the time of check and the time of use of memory addresses by the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) OS.
*   A compromised BIOS is required to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability allows for reading memory out of bounds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The vulnerability could potentially result in a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is a compromised BIOS which can manipulate memory addresses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have compromised the system's BIOS.
*   The attacker needs the capability to cause the TEE OS to read memory out of bounds.
