Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-46705:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `grub2-once` script in the `grub2` package uses a fixed filename `/var/tmp/grub2-cleanup-once` for a temporary file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Handling:** The script uses a hardcoded path in `/var/tmp`, which is a world-writable directory. An unprivileged user can create a symbolic link with that filename pointing to an arbitrary file.
*   **Arbitrary File Truncation:** When the `grub2-once` script runs, it opens the file for writing (using `>`), which will truncate the file the symlink is pointing to, if it exists.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Truncation:** An unprivileged user can exploit this vulnerability to truncate arbitrary files on the system by creating a symlink to the desired file. This could lead to denial-of-service by deleting important files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any unprivileged user with local access to the system.
*   **Symbolic Link Creation:** The attacker needs to create a symlink with the filename `/var/tmp/grub2-cleanup-once` pointing to the target file before the `grub2-once` script is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unprivileged User:** The attacker must have the ability to log in to the system as a normal user.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker requires write access in `/var/tmp`, which is typically world-writable.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to create the symlink before `grub2-once` is executed, but this is usually not a concern as the file is created and closed in the script itself.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced by recent changes in openSUSE.
*   The fix involved moving the temporary file creation to `/var/lib/misc` to avoid the possibility of symlink attacks.
*   The bug was initially reported as an embargoed issue before becoming public.
