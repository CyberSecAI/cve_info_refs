- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization of the `code` parameter in the `/rsms/` node application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. In this specific case, the attacker was able to make the system interact with an external domain by using the `load_file` function and can gain administrator account control.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `/rsms/` endpoint, by manipulating the `code` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No other specific capabilities or position are mentioned.
