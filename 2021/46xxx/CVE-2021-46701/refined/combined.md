| Explanation Some time ago, there was fix for allowing only chrome extension to connect to server (PreMiD app), but I noticed that I can still access server by just selecting transport as `websocket`. It works on localhost and can be done on websites. It allows to receive and emit events to socket. Related to [#501](https://github.com/PreMiD/PreMiD/pull/501) Steps to reproduce  * Go to <https://ririxidev.github.io/index.html> * Open Console * You should get two things from app:   + Version   + Discord User   and PreMiD app should open file dialog to "select local presence" Code to access socket ``` const socket = io("ws://localhost:3020", { transports: ["websocket"] });  socket.on("connect", io => { 		console.log("Sending event getVersion"); 		socket.emit("getVersion"); 		console.log("Sending event selectLocalPresence"); 		socket.emit("selectLocalPresence"); 	});  socket.on("receiveVersion", version => { 		console.log(`App version: ${version}`); 	});  socket.on("discordUser", user => { 		console.log(`Discord user: ${user}`); 	}); ```  Tested on latest PreMiD app (2.2.0) |

| Fixed CORS, just check if there is origin header 🤷‍♀️, like before. This code has been removed in v2.2.0 for no reason when there was update to socket.io v3.  ``` io = new socketIo.Server(server, { 			serveClient: false, 			allowEIO3: true, 			allowRequest: (req, callback) => { 				const noOriginHeader = req.headers.origin === undefined; 				callback(null, noOriginHeader); 			} 		}); ```  Fixed in [#791](https://github.com/PreMiD/PreMiD/pull/791) |
