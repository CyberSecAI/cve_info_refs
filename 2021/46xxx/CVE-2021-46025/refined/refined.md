Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization when adding a tag in the OneBlog application's backend. Specifically, the application does not sanitize the 'description' parameter when a new tag is added via the `/tag/add` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. This occurs because the application saves the unsanitized `<script>alert("xss")</script>` payload in the database. When the tag description is displayed to other users or in the application, the script executes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the context of the victim's browser.
- **Potential Account Compromise:**  An attacker could potentially use this XSS to perform actions on behalf of a user, steal cookies, redirect to malicious websites, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is conducted remotely via HTTP requests.
- **Endpoint:** The vulnerable endpoint is `POST /tag/add`.
- **Parameter:** The malicious payload is injected via the `description` parameter in the POST request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be authenticated as an administrator or a user with access to the "add tag" functionality in the backend.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Knowledge of the Application:** The attacker needs to know the specific POST endpoint and parameter used to add new tags.
