## Description

![@paragonie-security](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15914520?u=dcacc5545a2b31c3b989c42523a7cc30c1638a72&v=4&size=48)[paragonie-security](https://github.com/paragonie-security)opened [on Aug 4, 2021](https://github.com/firebase/php-jwt/issues/351#issue-959906029)

This is a follow-up to the [HS256/RS256 Type Confusion attack](https://auth0.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/) against the JWT protocol.

Now, firebase/php-jwt attempts to side-step this risk by forcing the user to hard-code the algorithms they wish to support.

[php-jwt/src/JWT.php](https://github.com/firebase/php-jwt/blob/d2113d9b2e0e349796e72d2a63cf9319100382d2/src/JWT.php#L103-L108)

|  | if (!\in\_array($header->alg, $allowed\_algs)) { |
|  | throw new UnexpectedValueException('Algorithm not allowed'); |
|  | } |

If `$key` is an array, and `$header` contains a `kid` field, the key used to verify a token is determined by the `kid` header.

### Reintroducing the Vulnerability

**EDIT: 2021-08-11** - This example is a bit misleading. See the attached Proof of Concept file instead. [php-jwt-poc.zip](https://github.com/firebase/php-jwt/files/6966712/php-jwt-poc.zip)

---

Let's say you're a service that wants to check `HS256` tokens against one key type and `RS256` tokens against another. Your `HS256` key has `{"kid":"gandalf0"}`, while your `RS256` public key has `{"kid":"legolas1"}`.

You might call php-jwt like so:

```
<?php
$validated = JWT::decode(
    $attackerControlledString,
    [
        'galdalf0' => '256-bit key goes here',
        'legolas1' => 'RSA public key goes here'
    ],
    ['RS256', 'HS256']
);
```

If anyone ever sets up JWT like this:

***Congratulations!** you've just reintroduced the critical vulnerability in your usage of the app.*

All you have to do is set `{"alg":"HS256","kid":"legolas1"}` and use the SHA256 hash of the RSA public key as an HMAC key, and you can mint tokens all day long.

### Another Way To Setup This Vulnerability

Let's say you have two different endpoints that only each accept one JWT signature algorithm.

* `/oauth` only allows `RS256` tokens
* `/rpc` only allows `HS256` tokens

This is clearly a safer usage of the firebase/php-jwt library than the previous canned example.

Suppose you have a universal array that your application uses that maps keys--as is common with PHP frameworks.

```
<?php
return [
        'galdalf0' => '256-bit key goes here',
        'legolas1' => 'RSA public key goes here'
    ];
```

In this setup, once again, you've introduced a critical vulnerability into your application.

All an attacker needs to do is target your `/rpc` endpoint and swap the Key ID from `gandalf0` to `legolas1` and they can mint tokens.

## What's going on here?

The fundamental problem is that the keys passed to firebase/php-jwt are just strings. This flies in the face of cryptography engineering best practices: [A key should always be considered to be the raw key material **alongside its parameter choices**](https://twitter.com/SchmiegSophie/status/1264567198091079681).

### Is this a security vulnerability?

This is not a vulnerability in the firebase/php-jwt library. It is, however, a very sharp edge that an unsuspecting developer could cut themselves on.

Cryptography should be easy to use, hard to misuse, and secure by default.

Whether the JOSE authors want to acknowledge it or not, what they published was a cryptographic protocol--one that fails to live up to these tenets. It's worth noting that [PASETO](https://github.com/paseto-standard/paseto-spec) mitigates this in its specification, so library authors don't have to even worry about it.

~~Any application that uses this library *in the way described above* has a critical vulnerability, so it may be prudent to publish a security advisory and/or obtain a CVE identifier.~~ **Update**: This was assigned **[CVE-2021-46743](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8xf4-w7qw-pjjw "CVE-2021-46743")**

The good news is: This can be easily fixed.

The bad news is: It constitutes a backwards compatibility break.

## How to Fix This Library

If you were to update the API to require keys to be a `Keyring` object, which maps a string KeyID (`kid`) to a `JWTKey` object--and that `JWTKey` object had a hard-coded algorithm that it could be used with--then this issue would be easily avoided.

### Pseudocode

```
<?php
class JWTKey {
    protected string $alg;
    protected string $keyMaterial;
    public function __construct(string $keyMaterial, string $alg) {}
    public function isValidFor(string $headerAlg): bool
    {
         return hash_equals($this->alg, $headerAlg);
    }
    public function getKeyMaterial(): string
    {
         return $this->keyMaterial;
    }
    public function __toString()
    {
        return $this->keyMaterial;
    }
}
```

```
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);
final class Keyring implements ArrayAccess {
    /** @var array<string, JWTKey> $mapping */
    private array $mapping;

    public function mapKeyId(string $keyId, JWTKey $key): self
    {
         $this->mapping[$keyId] = $key;
         return $this;
    }

    public offsetExists($offset): bool {
        return array_key_exists($offset, $this->mapping);
    }
    public offsetGet($offset): JWTKey {
        return $this->mapping[$offset];
    }
    public offsetSet($offset, $value): void {
         $this->mapKeyId($offset, $value);
    }
    public offsetUnset(mixed $offset): void {
         unset($this->mapping[$offset]);
    }
}
```

```
-     public static function decode($jwt, $key, array $allowed_algs = array())
+     public static function decode($jwt, JWTKey|Keyring $key, array $allowed_algs = array())
```

```
-         if (\is_array($key) || $key instanceof \ArrayAccess) {
+         if ($key instanceof Keyring) {
              if (isset($header->kid)) {
```

```
+         if (!$key->isValidFor($header->alg)) {
+             throw new UnexpectedValueException('This key cannot be used with ' . $header->alg);
+         }
          // Check the signature
          if (!static::verify("$headb64.$bodyb64", $sig, $key, $header->alg)) {
```

Edited to clarify the value of a security advisory and/or CVE to ensure users of this library remain safe against attack.

## Package

## Affected versions

< 6.0.0

## Patched versions

6.0.0

## Description

In Firebase PHP-JWT before 6.0.0, an algorithm-confusion issue (e.g., RS256 / HS256) exists via the kid (aka Key ID) header, when multiple types of keys are loaded in a key ring. This allows an attacker to forge tokens that validate under the incorrect key. NOTE: this provides a straightforward way to use the PHP-JWT library unsafely, but might not be considered a vulnerability in the library itself.
