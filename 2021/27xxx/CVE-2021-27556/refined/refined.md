The provided content is a blog post detailing multiple vulnerabilities in ZenTao CMS, one of which is assigned CVE-2021-27556.

**CVE-2021-27556**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists due to a leftover code block in the `cron` module that allows execution of shell commands if the cron job type is set to 'system'. Although the user interface doesn't allow setting the type to 'system', the backend code doesn't prevent it if modified via a direct request.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Unrestricted modification of `zt_cron` table parameters: The code responsible for updating cron jobs allows arbitrary updates to fields in the `zt_cron` table, even if those options are not exposed in the user interface.
    *   Unremoved 'system' type execution path: The code still contains a path that executes shell commands if the `type` parameter of a cron job is set to `system`, despite it not being available via the user interface.
    *   Lack of input validation: The `command` field of the cron job is executed without any validation, allowing for arbitrary shell command execution.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with administrative access can execute arbitrary shell commands on the server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    1.  An attacker intercepts the request to create or update a cron job via burp suite or a similar proxy.
    2.  The attacker modifies the request to set the `type` parameter to `system`.
    3. The attacker sets the `command` parameter to the desired system command.
    4. The cron job executes on the schedule, executing the malicious command.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Administrative access to the ZenTao CMS application to access the Cron management functionality.

**Additional Vulnerabilities Mentioned**

The blog post also mentions two other related vulnerabilities in ZenTao CMS:

*   **CVE-2021-27557 (CSRF):** The application lacks CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious form and execute actions on behalf of an authenticated user. In this case the attacker can force an admin user to update a cronjob and set the type to `system`.
*   **CVE-2021-27558 (XSS):** The application has reflected XSS vulnerabilities, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the context of the application. This vulnerability can be combined with the CSRF to create a one click attack chain.

These vulnerabilities can be chained together: An attacker can use XSS to deliver a CSRF payload, which can modify the cron job settings, which results in remote code execution. This allows for RCE starting from just a normal user by escalating privileges.
