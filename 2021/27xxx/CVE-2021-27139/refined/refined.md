Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27139:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of CVE-2021-27139 is an information leak vulnerability in the HTTP server of FiberHome HG6245D routers. The `/info.asp` page exposes sensitive device information without requiring authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Pre-authentication Information Leak:** The web interface at `/info.asp` reveals sensitive information (Software Version, ONU State, LOID, IP Address, WAN Mac, etc.) without requiring any authentication.
-   **Predictable MAC Address:** The MAC address of the `br0` interface (LAN) is easily predictable from the WAN MAC address, making it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   An attacker can obtain sensitive information about the device.
-   The leaked WAN MAC address is used as a key for a telnet backdoor, allowing unauthorized access to the CLI.
-   The leaked LOID is used for FTTH connections which may help attacker to impersonate the device.
-  The leaked information can be used to further compromise the device using other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send a request to the device's web server. This can be done from the LAN or from the WAN through IPv6 due to the lack of IPv6 firewall rules.
-   **HTTP Request:**  The attacker sends an HTTP GET request to `https://<target_ip>/info.asp`. Javascript must be disabled to avoid redirect.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker must have network connectivity to the router's web interface (either via LAN or IPv6 on WAN).
-   No prior authentication or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.
