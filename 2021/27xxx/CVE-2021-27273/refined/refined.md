Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-27273:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `SettingConfigController` class of the NETGEAR ProSAFE Network Management System.
*   The system fails to properly validate a user-supplied string (specifically the `fileName` parameter) before using it in a system call.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The lack of proper validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system call. This is a classic command injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **SYSTEM Level Access:** The injected code executes within the context of the `SYSTEM` user, granting the attacker full control of the system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   **HTTP request:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `fileName` parameter, which is likely sent via an HTTP request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authentication (Bypassable):** While the vulnerability requires authentication, the advisory notes that the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. This suggests that an attacker does not require valid credentials.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target system to send the malicious request.

**Summary:**
CVE-2021-27273 is a critical vulnerability that allows for remote code execution on the NETGEAR ProSAFE Network Management System due to a lack of proper input validation, specifically in the handling of the `fileName` parameter within the `SettingConfigController` class. This can lead to complete system compromise.

The provided information is consistent with and adds details to the CVE description by providing the vulnerable class (`SettingConfigController`) and the specific parameter (`fileName`) involved. It also mentions the bypassable nature of the authentication mechanism.
