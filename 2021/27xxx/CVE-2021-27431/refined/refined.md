Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-27431:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Integer wrap-around in the `osRtxMemoryAlloc` function (a local malloc equivalent) within ARM CMSIS-RTOS2.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the memory allocation logic, where an integer wrap-around during size calculations can lead to allocating a smaller-than-expected memory buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation can lead to arbitrary memory allocation. This can result in:
    - Unexpected behavior like a crash.
    - Potential for code injection/execution by overwriting memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, with low complexity, and does not require user interaction

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without any prior authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities found across various Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) and supporting libraries, known as "BadAlloc".
- The document provides a CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 with a vector string of AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L for this specific vulnerability.
- Mitigation involves updating ARM CMSIS-RTOS2 to a version after 2.1.3.
