Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is an **Improper Authorization** flaw within the CEM Systems AC2000 software. Specifically, the application fails to perform an adequate authorization check for functions that require a verified user identity. This occurs under specific conditions when Single Sign-On (SSO) is implemented and the AC2000 Application Programming Interface (API) is installed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-285: Improper Authorization** - The application does not correctly verify if a user has the necessary permissions before allowing access to certain functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to access the system without proper authorization. The impact includes:
    - **Confidentiality:** High - Unauthorized access can expose sensitive data within the system.
    - **Integrity:** Low - An attacker might be able to make unauthorized modifications to the system.
    - **Availability:** None - The vulnerability does not directly impact the system's availability

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack is not difficult to execute

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to the system.
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior system privileges or credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability does not require any interaction from the victim user.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- CEM Systems AC2000 versions 10.1 through 10.5.
- Only applies to users who have implemented Single Sign-On (SSO) and have installed the AC2000 Application Programming Interface (API).

**Mitigation:**
- Apply the official patch provided by Johnson Controls.
- The fix is included in Version 10.5 Server Feature Pack 2, Version 10.6, and all future releases.
- Users should contact a CEM support team to access the patch.
- Minimize network exposure for all control system devices.
- Locate control system networks behind firewalls.
- Use secure methods such as VPNs when remote access is required.
