## ICONICS GENESIS64 DWG File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure Vulnerability

### ZDI-21-1238ZDI-CAN-14065

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-27040](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-27040) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 3.3, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | ICONICS |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | GENESIS64 |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of ICONICS GENESIS64. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DWG files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated data structure. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | ICONICS has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

## Autodesk Trust Center

### Security advisory

Advisories are used to communicate information related to vulnerabilities identified with Autodesk® products and services. This includes any fixes or workarounds that are applicable to the affected product.

## Vulnerabilities in the Autodesk® AutoCAD® family of products

---

**Autodesk ID:** ADSK-SA-2021-0004

**Product, Service, Component:** Autodesk® AutoCAD®, Advance Steel and Civil 3D

**Impact:** Out-of-bound Read, Out-of-bound Write, Write-what-where Condition

**Severity:** High

**Original Publish:** 17/06/2021

**Last Revised:**27/08/2021

| Severity | CVSS Score | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Low | 0.1 - 3.9 | A vulnerability where scope and impact of exploitation is restricted and the ability to exploit is extremely difficult. |
| Medium | 4.0 - 6.9 | A vulnerability where exploitation is mitigated by factors such as difficulty to exploit, default configuration or ease of identification. |
| High | 7.0 - 8.9 | A vulnerability, which if exploited, would directly impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of user's data or processing resources. |
| Critical | 9.0 - 10 | A vulnerability, which if exploited, would allow remote execution of malicious code without user action. |

### Summary

Applications and Services that utilize Autodesk AutoCAD products are affected by Out-of-bound Read, Out-of-bound Write, and Memory Corruption vulnerabilities. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary code execution.

### Description

The details of the vulnerabilities are as follows:

1. CVE-2021-27040 - A maliciously crafted DWG file can be forced to read beyond allocated boundaries when parsing the DWG file. This vulnerability can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
2. CVE-2021-27041 - A maliciously crafted DWG file can be used to write beyond the allocated buffer while parsing DWG files. This vulnerability can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
3. CVE-2021-27042 - A maliciously crafted DWG file can be used to write beyond the allocated buffer while parsing DWG files. The vulnerability exists because the application fails to handle a crafted DWG file, which causes an unhandled exception. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.
4. CVE-2021-27043 - An Arbitrary Address Write issue in the Autodesk DWG application can allow a malicious user to leverage the application to write in unexpected paths. In order to exploit this the attacker would need the victim to enable full page heap in the application.

### Recommendations

Users of the 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 versions of Autodesk® Advance Steel, Autodesk® Civil 3D, AutoCAD®, AutoCAD® LT, and AutoCAD-based specialized toolsets listed in the table above should install the latest AutoCAD®, AutoCAD LT 2019-2022 Updates via the Autodesk Desktop App, or the [Accounts Portal.](https://manage.autodesk.com/) Customers using previous versions that no longer qualify for full support should plan to upgrade to a supported version as soon as possible to avoid downtime and potential security vulnerabilities. Visit the [Autodesk Knowledge Network](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/customer-service/account-management/users-software/previous-versions) for more information about previous version support.Note: Users of the specialized toolsets need to install either the AutoCAD update(s) listed above or a more recent product version. These security fixes are not included in the updates specific to individual toolsets.

## ICONICS GENESIS64 DWG File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure Vulnerability

### ZDI-21-1236ZDI-CAN-14060

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-27040](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-27040) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 3.3, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | ICONICS |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | GENESIS64 |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of ICONICS GENESIS64. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DWG files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated data structure. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | ICONICS has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2021-06-25 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2021-10-28 - Coordinated public release of advisory |
