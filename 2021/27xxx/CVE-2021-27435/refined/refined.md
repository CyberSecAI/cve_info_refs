  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-27435",
    "description": "ARM mbed product Version 6.3.0 is vulnerable to integer wrap-around in malloc_wrapper function, which can lead to arbitrary memory allocation, resulting in unexpected behavior such as a crash or a remote code injection/execution.",
    "affected_products": [
      "ARM mbed OS, Version 6.3.0"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow or wraparound in the `malloc_wrapper` function.",
    "vulnerability": "Integer wrap-around leading to arbitrary memory allocation.",
    "impact": "Unexpected behavior such as a crash or remote code injection/execution.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited by triggering the vulnerable `malloc_wrapper` function in a way that leads to an integer overflow during size calculation.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "No specific capabilities are mentioned beyond being able to trigger the vulnerable function. The CISA advisory states that the vulnerability is exploitable remotely with low attack complexity.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow when calculating the size of the allocation, causing a small amount of memory to be allocated. This can then cause a heap-based buffer overflow when the user tries to write more data than allocated.  This could lead to remote code execution."
