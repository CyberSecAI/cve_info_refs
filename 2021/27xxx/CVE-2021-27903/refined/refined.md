{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation when setting the file system path for Local volumes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
       "Remote Code Execution (RCE)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or disrupt normal application behavior by setting the Local volume's file system path to a system directory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Control panel access",
       "Manipulating input to volume settings"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have the ability to create or modify Local volumes via the control panel."
  },
    "additional_details": "The fix ensures that Local volume paths cannot point to a system directory (e.g., templates or vendor folders), protecting against unauthorized file system access."
