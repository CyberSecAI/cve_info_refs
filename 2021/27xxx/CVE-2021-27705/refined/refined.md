The provided content describes a buffer overflow vulnerability in Tenda G1 and G3 routers.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `formQOSRuleDel` function where the `qosIndex` parameter is directly copied to a stack-based local variable using `strcpy`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow: The `strcpy` operation does not perform bounds checking, allowing an attacker to overwrite data beyond the allocated buffer size.
- Stack overflow: The overflow occurs on the stack, enabling the attacker to potentially overwrite the function's return address.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: By overwriting the return address, an attacker can redirect execution to their own injected code.
- Device compromise: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain full control over the affected router.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted GET request: The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted GET request to the router.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the router.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter: The attacker needs to know that the `qosIndex` parameter is vulnerable.
- Ability to craft overflow payload: The attacker needs to craft a payload containing malicious code and overwrite the return address.
