## SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer JT File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-21-312ZDI-CAN-12433

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-27587](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-27587) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | SAP |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JT files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write before the start of an allocated data structure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |
