The provided content contains detailed information about multiple vulnerabilities in FiberHome HG6245D routers. This includes CVE-2021-27164, which is related to hardcoded credentials in the HTTP server.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2021-27164 is the presence of hardcoded credentials embedded within the web server's binary (`webs`). These credentials can be used to gain unauthorized access to the device's web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The primary weakness is the inclusion of multiple hardcoded usernames and passwords directly within the firmware's web server binary. These credentials are for different ISPs.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** There's no proper input validation to prevent the use of these credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can use these hardcoded credentials to log in to the web interface.
*   **Device Control:** After logging in, an attacker can gain complete control of the router, modify settings, and potentially gain further access to the network.
*   **Telnet Access:** These credentials, used with `https://ip/fh`, will open access to the CLI telnet on port 23/tcp

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker can attempt to login to the web interface using hardcoded credentials after network access is gained.
*   **Web Interface:** The attack is performed through the web login interface of the router.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the routerâ€™s web interface (either LAN or WAN via IPv6).
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know about the hardcoded credentials vulnerability and the associated credentials.
