        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper authorization checks when creating snapshots, allowing anonymous users to perform this action.",

        "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS) is the stated impact of exploiting this vulnerability.",
        "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is network-based, as it involves an anonymous user creating snapshots.",
