Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27665:

**Summary:**

This CVE relates to an integer overflow vulnerability in Johnson Controls' exacqVision Server (32-bit version). Successful exploitation could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Details:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The root cause is an integer overflow vulnerability present in the exacqVision Server software. Specifically, this occurs in the 32-bit version of the software.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The core vulnerability is an integer overflow (CWE-190). This type of flaw happens when an arithmetic operation results in a value that exceeds the maximum size that can be stored in the allocated memory space, leading to unexpected behavior, such as a crash or other vulnerability.

*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   The primary impact of a successful exploit is a denial-of-service (DoS).
    *   The vulnerability allows an attacker to cause the exacqVision Server to become unavailable, disrupting video surveillance services.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via network access.
    *   The attack complexity is considered low, indicating that exploitation does not require significant technical skills or special conditions.
    *   The attack does not require authentication. This means an attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing valid credentials.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted scripts over the network to the exacqVision Server.
    *   No prior authentication is required, meaning the attacker doesn't need to have legitimate access to the system to perform the attack.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products**:  The vulnerability specifically affects exacqVision Server 32-bit versions 21.06.11.0 and prior.
*   **Mitigation**: Johnson Controls recommends upgrading to exacqVision Server 32-bit Version 21.09, or upgrading to exacqVision Server 64-bit, as well as following best practice security guidelines.
*   **Vendor Advisory**: Johnson Controls released a Product Security Advisory JCI-PSA-2021-18v1, which provides additional details and mitigation guidance.
*  **Researcher**: Tenable Research reported the vulnerability.
*   **CVSS Score**:  The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).
