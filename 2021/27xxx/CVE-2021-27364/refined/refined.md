Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2021-27364:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The core issue lies in the lack of proper access control on the iSCSI initiator's NETLINK socket within the Linux kernel. The `iscsi_if_recv_msg()` function, responsible for receiving messages on this socket, does not enforce sufficient checks on the user's privileges before processing the commands sent.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:**  The primary weakness is the ability of any user to connect to the iSCSI NETLINK socket and send commands to the kernel, bypassing intended security restrictions.
*  **Missing Privilege Checks:** The `iscsi_if_recv_msg()` function should have checked if the user sending the messages had `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` or similar administrative capabilities.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** While not the primary focus of this CVE, the related CVE-2021-27365 highlights that the subsystem also doesn't properly limit the lengths of parameters sent via the NETLINK interface

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A non-root user can send commands to the kernel via the NETLINK socket that disrupts the iSCSI subsystem. For instance, they can terminate active iSCSI sessions.
*  **Privilege Escalation:** Coupled with other vulnerabilities like CVE-2021-27363 (information leak of the transport handle), this could enable non-root users to achieve privilege escalation by allowing more control of kernel subsystems.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local access to the system. An attacker needs to have shell access to the machine where the vulnerable iSCSI initiator is running.
*   **NETLINK Socket:**  Attackers exploit the exposed NETLINK socket, sending malicious commands directly to the kernel to trigger the vulnerability.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker requires local user access to the machine running the vulnerable iSCSI initiator.
*  **No root privilege required:** The vulnerability can be triggered by an unprivileged user.
*   **Knowledge of iSCSI:**  To fully exploit the vulnerability for more impactful results, they might need some knowledge about the iscsi protocol.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was present in kernel source since the introduction of open-iscsi and all kernel version that include this code are vulnerable until a fix was applied.
*  The combination of CVE-2021-27363 and CVE-2021-27364 enables non-root users to disconnect iSCSI sessions which are running on the target machine.
*  The fix enforces a `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` check before messages on the NETLINK socket are processed and blocks unauthorized access to iscsi transport handles through sysfs.
