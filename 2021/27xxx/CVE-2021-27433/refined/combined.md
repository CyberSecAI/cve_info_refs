Google PSIRT will assign a CVE. CVSS score will be calculated when a CVE has been assigned.

#### 4.2.22    [INTEGER OVERFLOW OR WRAPAROUND CWE-190](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

Micrium OS Versions 5.10.1 and prior are vulnerable to integer wrap-around in functions Mem\_DynPoolCreate, Mem\_DynPoolCreateHW and Mem\_PoolCreate. This unverified memory assignment can lead to arbitrary memory allocation, resulting in unexpected behavior such as very small blocks of memory being allocated instead of very large ones.

[CVE-2021-27411](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-27411) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H)).

#### 4.2.23    [INTEGER OVERFLOW OR WRAPAROUND CWE-190](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

Micrium uC/OS: uC/LIB Versions 1.38.xx, 1.39.00 are vulnerable to integer wrap-around in functions Mem\_DynPoolCreate, Mem\_DynPoolCreateHW and Mem\_PoolCreate. This unverified memory assignment can lead to arbitrary memory allocation, resulting in unexpected behavior such as very small blocks of memory being allocated instead of very large ones.

[CVE-2021-26706](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-26706) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H)).

#### 4.2.24    [INTEGER OVERFLOW OR WRAPAROUND CWE-190](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

Zephyr Project RTOS versions prior to 2.5 are vulnerable to integer wrap-around sys\_mem\_pool\_alloc function, which can lead to arbitrary memory allocation resulting in unexpected behavior such as a crash or code execution.

[CVE-2020-13603](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-13603) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:P/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Apply available vendor updates.
* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

### Summary of changes

Backport of [#14407](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/pull/14407)

Add a check that the combined size of the buffer to allocate and `alloc_info_t` does not exceed the maximum integer value representable by `size_t`.

#### Impact of changes

#### Migration actions required

### Documentation

None.

---

### Pull request type

```
[x] Patch update (Bug fix / Target update / Docs update / Test update / Refactor)
[] Feature update (New feature / Functionality change / New API)
[] Major update (Breaking change E.g. Return code change / API behaviour change)

```

---

### Test results

```
[] No Tests required for this change (E.g docs only update)
[x] Covered by existing mbed-os tests (Greentea or Unittest)
[x] Tests / results supplied as part of this PR

```

Manual check: `malloc(SIZE_MAX)` now fails as expected.

| I locally checked on a K64F - the TLS socket test failures have nothing to do with this PR. It also fails on mbed-os-5.15.6 - did it pass during the previous release? Does this test also exist in the mbed-os-6.x.x release workflow? If it did pass last time, the failures could be related to the server this test suite talks to? |
