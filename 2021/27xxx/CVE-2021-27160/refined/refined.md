Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27160:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the presence of **hardcoded credentials** within the HTTP server (webs binary) of FiberHome HG6245D routers. These credentials are used for authentication to various parts of the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The web daemon contains numerous hardcoded username/password combinations for various ISPs and purposes. This includes a default admin/password, and other user accounts with weak or easily guessable passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can use the hardcoded credentials to gain unauthorized access to the web management interface.
*   **CLI Telnet Access:** Successful login to the web interface using these credentials will allow an attacker to enable the CLI telnet server on port 23/tcp, providing further access to the router.
*   **Full System Control:** Combined with other vulnerabilities, this can lead to a complete compromise of the device including achieving root shell access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** Attacker accesses the web management interface (`https://target/fh`) and attempts to log in with the hardcoded credentials.
*   **Network Access:** This attack can be performed from the LAN or WAN via IPv6 due to lack of firewall.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface (either from LAN or WAN).
*   **Knowledge of Hardcoded Credentials:** The attacker needs to be aware of the hardcoded username/password combinations, which are publicly available via the provided research.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided document lists multiple hardcoded credentials including those for `user`, `f~i!b@e#r$h%o^m\*esuperadmin`, `admin`, `telecomadmin`, and many more. Some credentials include default passwords for specific ISPs.
*   This vulnerability is part of a larger collection of security flaws in FiberHome routers.
