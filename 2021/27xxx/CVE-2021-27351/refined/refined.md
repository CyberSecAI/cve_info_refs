Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27351:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an insufficient session expiration mechanism in the Telegram application. Specifically, the "Terminate Session" feature failed to properly invalidate a recently active session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Session Termination:** The application does not effectively terminate sessions when requested, allowing them to remain active even after a user attempts to end them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a **security bypass**. An attacker could potentially maintain access to a user's account even after the user has attempted to terminate the session. The content does not provide specifics on what level of access is retained.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Telegram application's session management functionality itself.
- This vulnerability affects both the Telegram Desktop application (on Windows and UNIX systems) and the Android application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to have a prior active session on a victim's account that is targeted to be terminated.
- The attacker could potentially exploit this on the user's device, or if the attacker has obtained access to the user's session information through other means.
- The attacker may need to maintain the session while the victim is attempting to terminate it from a different device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The gentoo advisory specifies that the vulnerability affects Telegram Desktop versions prior to 2.4.11 and telegram-desktop-bin prior to 2.4.11
- The 0ffsecninja content specifies the vulnerability affects Telegram Android up to version 7.2.1 and Telegram Desktop (Windows/Unix) up to version 2.4.7.
- Both sources agree it is related to insufficient session termination.
- The vulnerability is rated as "low" severity and "remotely exploitable" by gentoo.
