Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed in the referenced commits:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a path traversal issue. It seems that the application was not properly sanitizing or validating file paths, allowing an attacker to potentially access files outside of the intended directories.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal: The application did not correctly handle user-provided input that contained path traversal sequences like `../`, which allows access to parent directories and potentially any file on the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized File Access: An attacker could potentially read sensitive files on the server, including configuration files, source code, or data.
- Data Breach: Access to sensitive files could lead to a data breach and compromise of the application and its users.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: In certain scenarios, path traversal vulnerabilities could be chained with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- User-provided input: The vulnerability was likely triggered through user-provided input that was used to construct file paths. This could be through URL parameters, form data, or any other user-controlled input.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Basic web application interaction: An attacker would need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- Knowledge of the application's file structure (though this may be discovered through exploitation).
- No elevated privileges would be needed as the exploitation occurs by manipulating file path parameters to access system files.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix for the path traversal vulnerability was implemented in the `src/Utils/PathCanonicalize.php` file.
- The commit message "[security] Don't allow Path Traversal" indicates that the fix was specifically targeted to prevent path traversal attacks.
- The vulnerability was identified and reported by Silvia VÃ¤li from Clarified Security.

The content provides more details about the vulnerability than what is usually available in a standard CVE description, it clarifies that the vulnerability was a Path Traversal and the fix was applied to the `src/Utils/PathCanonicalize.php` file.
