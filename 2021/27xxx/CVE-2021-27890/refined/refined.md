{
  "CVE-2021-27890": {
    "Root cause": "Improper escaping of theme properties included in theme XML files when used in SQL queries.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "SQL injection (CWE-89)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code and compromise the underlying server.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Importing a maliciously crafted theme by a forum administrator with the 'Can manage themes?' permission.",
      "Using the 'Export Theme' or 'Duplicate Theme' features in the Admin Control Panel by a forum administrator.",
      "A user visiting a forum page for which the vulnerable theme has been set."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious theme file. If the attacker can get an administrator to import the theme or trigger usage of the theme through the Admin CP's 'Export Theme' or 'Duplicate Theme' feature, the attacker could exploit the vulnerability. Alternatively, the attacker can compromise a user and set the theme for that user, such that when they visit a page, the vulnerability is triggered."
