- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The DNS client in Nucleus NET does not properly randomize UDP port numbers used in DNS requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficiently random values are used for UDP port numbers in DNS requests (CWE-330). This makes it easier to predict the source port.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can poison the DNS cache or spoof DNS resolving by predicting the port number and injecting malicious DNS responses.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is network-based and can be exploited remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious DNS responses into the network to perform DNS cache poisoning or spoofing. No special access or privileges are required.
