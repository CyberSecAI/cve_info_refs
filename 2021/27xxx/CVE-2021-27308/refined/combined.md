| **Vulnerable parameter**: redirect  **XSS sample Payload**: '"()%26%25<ScRiPt%20>alert(document.cookie)</ScRiPt>  **Steps to reproduce the vulnerability(POC)**: 1- Goto 4images admin panel page (demo instance:<https://localhost/4images/admin/index.php>) 2- Enter the credentials , Turn on the intercept and click on "Login" 3- copy paste the XSS payload after `redirect=./../admin/index.php%3Fsessionid=xxxxxPASTEPAYLOADHERE` 4-Forward the request and you can see XSS is triggered.  **Video POC**: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/12T39ZCqpbdz29gKptIdPnNHy1Nudr9Cs/view?usp=sharing>  **Impact**: With the help of xss attacker can perform social engineering on users by redirecting them from a real website to a fake ones. Attacker can steal their cookies leading to account takeover and download malware on their system, and there are many more attacking scenarios a skilled attacker can perform with XSS. |
