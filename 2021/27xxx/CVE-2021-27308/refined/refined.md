The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in 4images v1.8, as reported in GitHub issue #3.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `redirect` parameter of the admin panel login page, which is not properly sanitized allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Social engineering attacks by redirecting users to fake websites.
- Stealing user cookies, potentially leading to account takeover.
- Downloading and executing malware on user systems.
- Various other malicious activities that can be performed through XSS.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `redirect` parameter and convinces a user to click on it after logging in.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to manipulate the redirect URL after a successful login attempt to the admin panel. This could be achieved through MITM or other means.
- Basic understanding of HTTP requests and the ability to modify parameters in URLs or through a proxy.
