# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| Hi, there.  I find there is use after free issue in multithread processing in stream.c in the newest master branch [597be1f](https://github.com/ckolivas/lrzip/commit/597be1ffbdf11c8a07386f71be0a280581fe24da). The reason is that the buffer is unchecked during a multithread stream read. Here is the detailed explanation:  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7632714/92203219-3725c400-eeb3-11ea-8520-ccce9b80d410.png)  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7632714/92203316-69cfbc80-eeb3-11ea-84bc-ac875b78fc22.png)  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7632714/92203380-9edc0f00-eeb3-11ea-93be-1a17382d4a9b.png)  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7632714/92203465-ccc15380-eeb3-11ea-91ae-6fd175f20f80.png)  The high-level reason is similar to issue [#164](https://github.com/ckolivas/lrzip/issues/164), but the program behavior/path is different.  To reproduce, run  ``` lrzip -t uaf-stream546.lrz  ```  **Since it is a problem in the multithread program, you might need to run this command multiple times to trigger.**  POC (unzip first): [uaf-stream546.lrz.zip](https://github.com/ckolivas/lrzip/files/5172892/uaf-stream546.lrz.zip)  Here is the output from the terminal:  ``` Decompressing...

                 CVE-2022-26291
Debian Bug     : 888506 990583

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in lrzip, a
compression program. Invalid pointers, use-after-free and infinite
loops would allow attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
other unspecified impact via a crafted compressed file.

CVE-2018-5786

    There is an infinite loop and application hang in the get_fileinfo
    function (lrzip.c). Remote attackers could leverage this
    vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted lrz file.

CVE-2020-25467

    A null pointer dereference was discovered lzo_decompress_buf in
    stream.c which allows an attacker to cause a denial of service
    (DOS) via a crafted compressed file.

CVE-2021-27345

    A null pointer dereference was discovered in ucompthread in
    stream.c which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS)
    via a crafted compressed file.

CVE-2021-27347

    Use after free in lzma_decompress_buf function in stream.c in
    allows attackers to cause Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted
    compressed file.

CVE-2022-26291

    lrzip was discovered to contain a multiple concurrency
    use-after-free between the functions zpaq_decompress_buf() and
    clear_rulist(). This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a
    Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted lrz file.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
0.631-1+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your lrzip packages.
