- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists within the `AvastSvc.exe` module, where an attacker can create a directory junction that the service will then process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper handling of directory junctions by the Avast service allows an attacker to manipulate the service into deleting arbitrary directories.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition by deleting arbitrary directories on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is local and requires the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. The specific attack involves creating a directory junction that `AvastSvc.exe` then processes, leading to arbitrary directory deletion.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code with low privileges on the target system.
