# NULL dereference on memory allocation error (src/ flb\_avro) #3044

## Description

![@raminfp](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10054759?u=da73bdc0093c9bf2471a0e7c61c656fe9966be2a&v=4&size=48)[raminfp](https://github.com/raminfp)opened [on Feb 9, 2021](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/issues/3044#issue-804266845)
## Bug Report

**Describe the bug**

NULL dereference (value returned by flb\_malloc is not checked) after memory allocation error (flb\_malloc is wrapper on malloc returning NULL on unsuccessful allocation).

In most cases this issue will lead to crash via segmentation fault.

**Vulnerable Code**

```
flb_sds_t flb_msgpack_raw_to_avro_sds(const void *in_buf, size_t in_size, struct flb_avro_fields *ctx)
{
    msgpack_unpacked result;
    msgpack_object *root;

    size_t avro_buffer_size = in_size * 3;
    char *out_buff = flb_malloc(avro_buffer_size);

    .... SKIP.....

   flb_debug("before avro_writer_memory\n");
    awriter = avro_writer_memory(out_buff, avro_buffer_size);
    if (awriter == NULL) {
```

**To Reproduce**

Problem was identified by source code review.

**Expected behavior**

Memory allocation errors should be handled by checking value returned by flb\_malloc().

**Your Environment**

* Version used:

  Current "master" branch

**Additional context**

See following recommendations for details:

### @yongtang **[yongtang](/yongtang)** commented [Feb 9, 2021](#issue-804888123)

This is a follow up on PR [#3045](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/pull/3045). While [#3045](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/pull/3045) fixed the potential SIGSERV

issue caused by memory allocation error in flb\_avro, after searching/reviewing

it looks like src/http\_server/api/v1/metrics.c also consists of several

similar issues.

This PR adds proper check to prevent the potential SIGSERV issues.
