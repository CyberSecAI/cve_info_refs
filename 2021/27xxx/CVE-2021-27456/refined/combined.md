## Philips Product Security **Designed-In**

In recognition of the critical role security plays across today’s interconnected digital ecosystem, Philips is committed to the articulation and execution of a comprehensive security plan that assures the safety of patient, personal, and business data. We have updated our Product Security Statement to reflect the rapidly changing security environment and our response to provide designed-in security with our products to meet the latest challenges.

        [Product Security Statement (PDF) (2.27MB)](https://www.philips.com/c-dam/b2bhc/master/About-Us/customer-support/cyber-security-position-paper.pdf "Product Security Statement (opens in a new window)")                [![product security download (.pdf) file](/c-dam/corporate/security/master/mh01/cybersecurity-paper-thumb.png "(opens in a new window)")       2.27 MB](/c-dam/b2bhc/master/About-Us/customer-support/cyber-security-position-paper.download.pdf "product security download (.pdf) file")
### Security status

Philips Product Security Status documents have product-specific vulnerability updates and security-related information such as supported anti-virus software, OS security features, and remote service.

Each product has its own table and the products are separated by modality, i.e. Informatics, Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance, etc. The Status Documents list known software vulnerabilities, the current status, and Recommended Customer Action.

Revised tables are posted regularly with the latest available information.

### Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security

 As part of our commitment to product security and customer service, Philips Healthcare supplies our customers with information to help assess and address the vulnerabilities and risks associated with products that maintain or transmit ePHI.

Specifically, Philips Healthcare is using the Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security (MDS²) to provide security information about its products.

The MDS² contains product specific security information such as:

* Maintaining, storing, and transmitting ePHI
* Data back-up and removable media capabilities
* Installing security patches and anti-virus software
* Remote service access
* Audit logs of ePHI access including: Viewing; creating, modifying, and deleting records; importing/exporting

The MDS², a universal reporting form which allows Philips Healthcare to supply its customers with model-specific information, is endorsed by the American College of Clinical Engineering (ACCE), ECRI (formerly the Emergency Care Research Institute), the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), and the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS).

The form also contains security practice recommendations and explanatory notes from the manufacturer as well as detailed.

        [Form](https://philips.mizecx.com/cc?tabid=867 "Form (opens in a new window)")
### Customers must register for access.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Philips has identified the following guidance and mitigations:

* Users should operate all Philips deployed and supported Gemini PET/CT systems within Philips authorized specifications, including Philips approved software, software configuration, system services, and security configuration.
* Philips also recommends users implement a comprehensive, multi-layered strategy to protect systems from internal and external security threats, including restricting physical access of the scanner and removable media to only authorized personnel to reduce the risk of physical access by an unauthorized user.
* Patient health related information recorded on removable media may become accessible to unauthorized individuals despite the application of the anonymize function, which could create a security risk.

Users with questions regarding their specific installations of the Gemini PET/CT Family should contact a Philips service support team. Philips contact information is available at <https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/solutions/customer-service-solutions> or 1-800-722-9377
