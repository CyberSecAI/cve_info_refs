- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  The *Additional User Groups* ID numbers are saved in the Admin Control Panel without proper validation. This data is then used in SQL queries without sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability (CWE-89).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can perform an SQL injection, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. The CVSS score indicates high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting malicious input to the "Additional User Groups" ID field in the Admin Control Panel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrative privileges (PR:H) to access the Admin Control Panel and modify the affected settings.
