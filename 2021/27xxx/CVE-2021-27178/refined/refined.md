Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27178:

**Verification:**

The content directly references CVE-2021-27178 as one of the vulnerabilities found in FiberHome HG6245D routers, specifically related to passwords stored in clear text within the nvram.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is the practice of storing sensitive information, specifically passwords, in the non-volatile RAM (NVRAM) without any encryption or obfuscation.
*   **Weakness:** The weakness lies in the insecure storage of credentials in the NVRAM, making them easily accessible.
*   **Impact:** An attacker who gains access to the device's NVRAM can extract sensitive credentials, including Wi-Fi passwords, potentially leading to unauthorized access to networks and services.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Physical Access:** An attacker with physical access to the device might be able to extract the NVRAM contents.
    *   **Remote Access:** An attacker who has already compromised the device through other vulnerabilities (like those listed in the document), could gain access to the NVRAM.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker would need to have some level of access to the device, either physical or remote. Remote access could be achieved through exploiting other vulnerabilities present in the device.
    *   The attacker needs the ability to execute commands on the device or otherwise access the NVRAM data.

**Technical Details:**
The content explicitly states "Some passwords are stored in clear-text in nvram" and then provides an example of how `nvram show` reveals sensitive data such as Wi-Fi passwords (`wl0.1_key`, `wl0.1_wpa_psk`, `wl0_wpa_psk`, etc.).

This extracted information confirms the vulnerability as described.
