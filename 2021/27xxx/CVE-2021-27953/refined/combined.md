# Remote Denial of Service of ecobee3 lite – Level Nine Group

Unranked

**Advisory ID:**

L9-15-163

**First Published:**

June, 28th, 2021

**Last Updated:**

January, 22nd, 2024

**Version:**

4.5.81.200

**Category:**

Null Dereference

**Vendor:**

ecobee

**Product:**

ecobee3 lite

## Risk Summary

A threat actor sharing the same network as the Ecobee3 can craft a malicious HTTP request which will cause the device to crash and reboot.

## Technical Details

The Wireless Access Configuration (WAC) server used to connect the ecobee3 device to the WiFi networking using an Apple device crashes when a specially crafted web request is received.

#### POST request

![POST request](data:image/svg+xml...)![POST request](https://www.datocms-assets.com/26611/1624920916-1postrequest.png)

A threat actor can send a POST request to the endpoint http://

:1200/config and omit the ‘Content-Type’ header which causes the ‘HKProcessConfig==>memcpy’ function to read from the address space 0x00000000 causing the main application (idtm) to crash. Once a crash has occurred the ‘watchdog’ will cause the device to reset.

#### Normal operations
