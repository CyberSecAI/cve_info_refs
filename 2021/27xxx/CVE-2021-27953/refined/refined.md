The provided content is related to CVE-2021-27953 and describes a vulnerability in the ecobee3 lite device.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A null dereference vulnerability exists in the Wireless Access Configuration (WAC) server of the ecobee3 lite. The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted POST request is sent to the `/config` endpoint without the `Content-Type` header.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null dereference: The absence of the 'Content-Type' header in the POST request leads to the `memcpy` function within `HKProcessConfig` attempting to read from address space 0x00000000, causing a crash.
- Lack of proper input validation: The server doesn't handle the missing `Content-Type` header correctly, leading to the null dereference.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Exploiting this vulnerability causes the ecobee3 lite device to crash and reboot, disrupting its normal operation.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based: The attack is carried out by sending a malicious HTTP POST request over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable ecobee3 lite device.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the device's IP address on port 1200.
