- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `subscript_next` and `subscript_prev` wrappers in the `yottadb` crate could pass a pointer to freed memory to the underlying `ydb_subscript_next_st` and `ydb_subscript_prev_st` functions if the variable and subscripts did not have enough memory allocated on the first call. This occurs when a key is reallocated to accommodate a larger value, but the pointer to the old memory is retained.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free vulnerability due to incorrect pointer management during memory reallocation. Specifically, the pointer to the memory is not updated after reallocation and is used after the original memory is freed.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The use-after-free vulnerability can lead to memory corruption, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other unpredictable behavior.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by calling `sub_next_self_st` or `sub_prev_self_st` after a key has been reallocated to accommodate a larger value. This is achieved through API usage within the application that utilizes yottadb.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to control the input to the yottadb API in a way that causes the reallocation to occur, this would most likely be a user of the yottadb crate. No specific privileges are needed. Network access to the application would be required to exploit remotely.
