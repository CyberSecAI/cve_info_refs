Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-27169:

**CVE-2021-27169: Telnet server (CLI) - Hardcoded credentials**

*   **Root Cause:** The telnet CLI server running on port 23/tcp has multiple hardcoded credentials.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Hardcoded credentials for login.
    *   Specific hardcoded credentials exist for different ISPs.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the device's CLI interface with administrative privileges.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network access to the telnet server on port 23/tcp.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs network connectivity to the device on port 23/tcp, either from the LAN or WAN (if IPv6 is used or if firewall rules are bypassed).
    *   The attacker needs to know or guess the hardcoded credentials.

**Specific Hardcoded Credentials:**

*   `gpon`/`gpon`
*   `enable`: `gpon`
*   `admin` / 4 hexadecimal chars generated in `init_3bb_password()`
*   `rdsadmin` / `6GFJdY4aAuUKJjdtSn7d`
*   `gepon`/`gepon` (from another Fiberhome device firmware)

**Additional Details:**

*   The content provides the specific function `addDefualLoginAndUser()` from the `libci_adaptation_layer.so` library which contains these hardcoded credentials.
*   The telnet service on port 23/tcp is protected by firewall rules by default, but those can be bypassed, allowing for remote exploitation.
*   The research also highlights the use of similar code bases across various Fiberhome devices and firmware.
*   The content indicates that these backdoors are suspected to be intentionally placed by the vendor.
