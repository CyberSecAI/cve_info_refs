Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2019-19318, CVE-2019-19813, CVE-2019-19816

    "Team bobfuzzer" reported bugs in Btrfs that could lead to a
    use-after-free or heap buffer overflow, and could be triggered by
    crafted filesystem images.  A user permitted to mount and access
    arbitrary filesystems could use these to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-27815

    A flaw was reported in the JFS filesystem code allowing a local
    attacker with the ability to set extended attributes to cause a
    denial of service.

CVE-2020-27825

    Adam 'pi3' Zabrocki reported a use-after-free flaw in the ftrace
    ring buffer resizing logic due to a race condition, which could
    result in denial of service or information leak.

CVE-2020-28374

    David Disseldorp discovered that the LIO SCSI target implementation
    performed insufficient checking in certain XCOPY requests. An
    attacker with access to a LUN and knowledge of Unit Serial Number
    assignments can take advantage of this flaw to read and write to any
    LIO backstore, regardless of the SCSI transport settings.

CVE-2020-29568 (XSA-349)

    Michael Kurth and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported that frontends can
    trigger OOM in backends by updating a watched path.

CVE-2020-29569 (XSA-350)

    Olivier Benjamin and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported a use-after-free
    flaw which can be triggered by a block frontend in Linux blkback. A
    misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by continuously
    connecting / disconnecting a block frontend.

CVE-2020-29660

    Jann Horn reported a locking inconsistency issue in the tty
    subsystem which may allow a local attacker to mount a
    read-after-free attack against TIOCGSID.

CVE-2020-29661

    Jann Horn reported a locking issue in the tty subsystem which can
    result in a use-after-free. A local attacker can take advantage of
    this flaw for memory corruption or privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-36158

    A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the mwifiex WiFi driver
    which could result in denial of service or the execution of
    arbitrary code via a long SSID value.

CVE-2021-3178

    吴异 reported an information leak in the NFSv3 server.  When only
    a subdirectory of a filesystem volume is exported, an NFS client
    listing the exported directory would obtain a file handle to the
    parent directory, allowing it to access files that were not meant
    to be exported.

    Even after this update, it is still possible for NFSv3 clients to
    guess valid file handles and access files outside an exported
    subdirectory, unless the "subtree_check" export option is enabled.
    It is recommended that you do not use that option but only export
    whole filesystem volumes.

CVE-2021-3347

    It was discovered that PI futexes have a kernel stack use-after-free
    during fault handling. An unprivileged user could use this flaw to
    crash the kernel (resulting in denial of service) or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365)

    Olivier Benjamin, Norbert Manthey, Martin Mazein, and Jan
    H. Schönherr discovered that the Xen block backend driver
    (xen-blkback) did not handle grant mapping errors correctly.  A
    malicious guest could exploit this bug to cause a denial of
    service (crash), or possibly an information leak or privilege
    escalation, within the domain running the backend, which is
    typically dom0.

CVE-2021-26931 (XSA-362), CVE-2021-26932 (XSA-361), CVE-2021-28038 (XSA-367)

    Jan Beulich discovered that the Xen support code and various Xen
    backend drivers did not handle grant mapping errors correctly.  A
    malicious guest could exploit these bugs to cause a denial of
    service (crash) within the domain running the backend, which is
    typically dom0.

CVE-2021-27363

    Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
    properly restrict access to transport handle attributes in sysfs.
    On a system acting as an iSCSI initiator, this is an information
    leak to local users and makes it easier to exploit CVE-2021-27364.

CVE-2021-27364

    Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
    properly restrict access to its netlink management interface.  On
    a system acting as an iSCSI initiator, a local user could use
    these to cause a denial of service (disconnection of storage) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-27365

    Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
    correctly limit the lengths of parameters or "passthrough PDUs"
    sent through its netlink management interface.  On a system acting
    as an iSCSI initiator, a local user could use these to leak the
    contents of kernel memory, to cause a denial of service (kernel
    memory corruption or crash), and probably for privilege
    escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.258-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

scsi: iscsi: Ensure sysfs attributes are limited to PAGE\_SIZEAs the iSCSI parameters are exported back through sysfs, it should be
enforcing that they never are more than PAGE\_SIZE (which should be more
than enough) before accepting updates through netlink.
Change all iSCSI sysfs attributes to use sysfs\_emit().

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 419 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2809080.1).

### Affected Products and Patch Information

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 38 new security patches for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  30 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html#FMW)

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security updates are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the Critical Patch Update October 2021 to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update October 2021 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2796575.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2796575.1).

Debian Bug     : 983595

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service, or information leaks.

CVE-2020-27170, CVE-2020-27171

    Piotr Krysiuk discovered flaws in the BPF subsystem's checks for
    information leaks through speculative execution.  A local user
    could use these to obtain sensitive information from kernel
    memory.

CVE-2021-3348

    ADlab of venustech discovered a race condition in the nbd block
    driver that can lead to a use-after-free.  A local user with
    access to an nbd block device could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-3428

    Wolfgang Frisch reported a potential integer overflow in the
    ext4 filesystem driver.  A user permitted to mount arbitrary
    filesystem images could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365)

    Olivier Benjamin, Norbert Manthey, Martin Mazein, and Jan
    H. Schönherr discovered that the Xen block backend driver
    (xen-blkback) did not handle grant mapping errors correctly.  A
    malicious guest could exploit this bug to cause a denial of
    service (crash), or possibly an information leak or privilege
    escalation, within the domain running the backend, which is
    typically dom0.

CVE-2021-26931 (XSA-362), CVE-2021-26932 (XSA-361), CVE-2021-28038 (XSA-367)

    Jan Beulich discovered that the Xen support code and various Xen
    backend drivers did not handle grant mapping errors correctly.  A
    malicious guest could exploit these bugs to cause a denial of
    service (crash) within the domain running the backend, which is
    typically dom0.

CVE-2021-27363

    Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
    properly restrict access to transport handle attributes in sysfs.
    On a system acting as an iSCSI initiator, this is an information
    leak to local users and makes it easier to exploit CVE-2021-27364.

CVE-2021-27364

    Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
    properly restrict access to its netlink management interface.  On
    a system acting as an iSCSI initiator, a local user could use
    these to cause a denial of service (disconnection of storage) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-27365

    Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
    correctly limit the lengths of parameters or "passthrough PDUs"
    sent through its netlink management interface.  On a system acting
    as an iSCSI initiator, a local user could use these to leak the
    contents of kernel memory, to cause a denial of service (kernel
    memory corruption or crash), and probably for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-28660

    It was discovered that the rtl8188eu WiFi driver did not correctly
    limit the length of SSIDs copied into scan results.  An attacker
    within WiFi range could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to execute code on a
    vulnerable system.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.181-1~deb9u1.  This update additionally fixes Debian bug
#983595, and includes many more bug fixes from stable updates
4.19.172-4.19.181 inclusive.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.19 packages.

For the detailed security status of linux-4.19 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux-4.19>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

scsi: iscsi: Verify lengths on passthrough PDUsOpen-iSCSI sends passthrough PDUs over netlink, but the kernel should be
verifying that the provided PDU header and data lengths fall within the
netlink message to prevent accessing beyond that in memory.

# Introduction

## Dusting off a few new (old) vulns

Have you ever been casually perusing the source code of the Linux
kernel and thought to yourself "Wait a minute, that can’t be right"?
That’s the position we found ourselves in when we found three bugs in a
forgotten corner of the mainline Linux kernel that turned out to be
about 15 years old. Unlike most things that we find gathering dust,
these bugs turned out to still be good, and one turned out to be useable
as a Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) in multiple Linux environments.

## Who you calling SCSI?

The particular subsystem in question is the SCSI (Small Computer
System Interface) data transport, which is a standard for transferring
data made for connecting computers with peripheral devices, originally
via a physical cable, like hard drives. SCSI is a venerable standard
originally published in 1986 and was the go-to for server setups, and
iSCSI is basically SCSI over TCP. SCSI is still in use today, especially
if you’re dealing with certain storage situations, but how does this
become an attack surface on a default Linux system?

Through the magic of extensive package dependencies, rdma-core is one
of the packages that ends up being installed in any of the RHEL or
CentOS base environments that include a GUI (Workstation, Server with
GUI, and Virtualization Host), as well as Fedora Workstations.
Additionally, rdma-core could be installed on other distributions,
including Ubuntu and Debian, due to its use as a dependency for many
other packages (see Figure 1). On Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS and earlier, this was installed by default.

[![List of packages that depend on rdma-core on a default install of RHEL 8.3](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-075BetVCYMM/YEq0ciLpRqI/AAAAAAAABgE/3q_Me2S6cCoeM-gLiCgFbfNP3hzFLB_lwCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/dependencies.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-075BetVCYMM/YEq0ciLpRqI/AAAAAAAABgE/3q_Me2S6cCoeM-gLiCgFbfNP3hzFLB_lwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1916/dependencies.png)List of packages that depend on rdma-core on a default install of RHEL 8.3

RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) is a technology for
high-throughput, low-latency networking whose application to data
transfer and storage seems obvious. There are several implementations,
but the only one that’s relevant in the current discussion is
Infiniband, found in the ib\_iser kernel module.

If you’re thinking "wait, is all of this just automatically up and
running even if I don’t use SCSI or iSCSI?", that’s great because that
line of questioning would lead to you to the concept of on-demand kernel
module loading and an attack vector that’s been around for a long time.

## Automatic Module Loading, a.k.a. On-demand crufty kernel code

In an effort to be helpful and improve compatibility, the Linux
kernel can load kernel modules on-demand if particular code notices some
functionality is needed and can be loaded, like support for uncommon
protocol families. This is helpful, but it also opens up the attack
surface for local attackers because it allows unprivileged users to load
obscure kernel modules which they can then exploit. Public knowledge of
this has been around for over a decade, with grsecurity’s
GRKERNSEC\_MODHARDEN being introduced as a defense against this sort of
thing in 2009. Jon Oberheide’s tongue-in-cheek named [public exploit](https://jon.oberheide.org/files/i-can-haz-modharden.c) in 2010 made it plain that this was an issue, though Dan Rosenberg’s suggested patch [in 2010](https://lkml.org/lkml/2010/11/7/212)
implementing a sysctl option wasn’t adopted. There have been other
mitigations that have become available in the last few years, but
support for them varies between Linux distributions.

## So you’re telling me there are bugs?

One of the nice parts about having source code is you could just be
scanning visually and certain things might pop out and pique your
interest, making you want to pull the thread on them. The first bug we
found is like that. Seeing a bare sprintf means a buffer copy with no
length, which means its game over if it’s attacker-controlled data and
no previous length validation (see Figure 2).
So while there’s a fair number of indirections and macros, and you have
to jump through a number of files to follow the thread of execution,
the main bug is a simple buffer overflow because sprintf was used. This
is also an indication of a lack of security-conscious programming
practices that was prevalent at the time this code was developed, as the
other bugs show.

Overflows, overflows everywhere

The second bug is similar: using a kernel address as a handle.
Clearly a leftover from when there wasn’t any effort to keep the kernel
from leaking pointers, but nowadays it’s a handy Kernel Address Space
Layout Randomization (KASLR) bypass, as it points to a structure full of
pointers. And the final bug is simply failure to validate data from
userland, which is a classic kernel programming issue.

# Bug Identification

## Linux Kernel Heap Buffer Overflow

* Vulnerability Type: Heap Buffer Overflow
* Location: iscsi\_host\_get\_param() in `drivers/scsi/libiscsi.c`
* Affected Versions: Tested on RHEL 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3
* Impact: LPE, Information Leak, Denial of Service (DoS)
* CVE Number: CVE-2021-27365

The first vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the iSCSI
subsystem. The vulnerability is triggered by setting an iSCSI string
attribute to a value larger than one page, and then trying to read it.
Internally, a sprintf call (line 3397 in `drivers/scsi/libiscsi.c`
in the kernel-4.18.0-240.el8 source code) is used on the user-supplied
value with a buffer of a single page that is used for the seq file that
backs the iscsi attribute. More specifically, an unprivileged user can
send netlink messages to the iSCSI subsystem (in `drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c`) which sets attributes related to the iSCSI connection, such as hostname, username, etc, via the helper functions in `drivers/scsi/libiscsi.c`.
These attributes are only limited in size by the maximum length of a
netlink message (either 2\*\*32 or 2\*\*16 depending on the specific code
processing the message). The sysfs and seqfs subsystem can then be used
to read these attributes, however it will only allocate a buffer of
PAGE\_SIZE (single\_open in `fs/seq_file.c`, called when the sysfs file is opened). This bug was first introduced in 2006 (see `drivers/scsi/libiscsi.c`,
commits a54a52caad and fd7255f51a) when the iSCSI subsystem was being
developed. However, the kstrdup/sprintf pattern used in the bug has been
expanded to cover a larger number of fields since the initial commit.

## Linux Kernel Pointer Leak to Userspace

* Vulnerability Type: Kernel Pointer Leak
* Location: show\_transport\_handle() in drivers/scsi/scsi\_transport\_iscsi.c
* Affected Versions: Tested on RHEL 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3
* Impact: Information Leak
* CVE Number: CVE-2021-27363

In addition to the heap overflow vulnerability, GRIMM discovered a
kernel pointer leak that can be used to determine the address of the
iscsi\_transport structure. When an iSCSI transport is registered with
the iSCSI subsystem, the transport’s ”handle“ is available to
unprivileged users via the sysfs file system, at `/sys/class/iscsi_transport/$TRANSPORT_NAME/handle`. When read, the show\_transport\_handle function (in `drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c`)
is called, which leaks the handle. This handle is actually the pointer
to an iscsi\_transport struct in the kernel module’s global variables.

## Linux Kernel Out-of-Bounds Read

* Vulnerability Type: Out-of-Bounds Read
* Location: iscsi\_if\_recv\_msg() in drivers/scsi/scsi\_transport\_iscsi.c
* Affected Versions: Tested on RHEL 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3
* Impact: Information Leak, DoS
* CVE Number: CVE-2021-27364

The final vulnerability is an out-of-bounds kernel read in the libiscsi module (`drivers/scsi/libiscsi.c`). This bug is triggered via a call to send\_pdu (lines 3747-3750 in `drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c`
in the kernel-4.18.0-240.el8 source code). Similar to the first
vulnerability, an unprivileged user can craft netlink messages that
specify buffer sizes that the driver fails to validate, causing a
controllable out-of-bounds read. There are multiple user-controlled
values that are not validated, including the calculation of the size of
the preceding header, allowing for a read of up to 8192 bytes at a
controllable 32-bit offset from the original heap buffer.

# Technical Analysis

## Exploit

GRIMM developed [a Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit](https://github.com/grimm-co/NotQuite0DayFriday/tree/trunk/2021.03.12-linux-iscsi) that demonstrates the use of the first two vulnerabilities.

In its current state, the PoC has support for the `4.18.0-147.8.1.el8_1.x86_64`, `4.18.0-193.14.3.el8_2.x86_64`, and `4.18.0-240.el8.x86_64`
releases of the Linux kernel. Other versions of the Linux kernel are
also vulnerable, but symbol addresses and structure offsets will need to
be gathered before they can be exploited. See the `symbols.c`, `symbols.h`, and `utilities/get_symbols.sh`
script for a semi-automated symbol gathering approach. Testing was
performed against RHEL 8.1 through 8.3, but other Linux distributions
using the same underlying kernel images are vulnerable as well.

### KASLR Leak

Before we can start modifying kernel structures and changing function
pointers, we’ve got to bypass KASLR. Linux randomizes the base address
of the kernel to hinder the exploitation process. However, due to
numerous sources of local information leak, KASLR [can often be bypassed](https://forums.grsecurity.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=3367)
by a local user. This exploit is no exception, as it includes two separate information leaks which enable it to bypass KASLR.

The first information leak comes from a non-null terminated heap buffer. When an iSCSI string attribute is set via the `iscsi_switch_str_param` function (shown below), the `kstrdup` function is called on the user provided input (in `new_val_buf`).
However, the buffer containing the user input is not initialized upon
allocation, and the kernel does not enforce that the user’s input is
NULL terminated. As a result, the `kstrdup` function will
copy any non-NULL bytes after the client input, which can later be
retrieved by reading back the attribute. The exploit abuses this
information leak by specifying a string of 656 bytes, which results in
the address of the `netlink_sock_destruct` being included in the `kstrdup`’ed
string. Later, the exploit reads back the attribute set here, and
obtains the address of this function. By then subtracting off the base
address of the `netlink_sock_destruct`, the exploit can calculate the kernel slide. The allocation which sets the `netlink_sock_destruct` function pointer is performed in the `__netlink_create` function (`net/netlink/af_netlink.c`) as a natural side effect of sending a netlink message.

```
int iscsi_switch_str_param(char **param, char *new_val_buf)
{
  char *new_val;

  if (*param) {
    if (!strcmp(*param, new_val_buf))
      return 0;
  }

  new_val = kstrdup(new_val_buf, GFP_NOIO);
  if (!new_val)
    return -ENOMEM;

  kfree(*param);
  *param = new_val;
  return 0;
}
```

The second information leak obtains the address of the target module’s `iscsi_transport`
structure via the second vulnerability. This structure defines the
transport’s operations, i.e. how it handles each of the various iSCSI
requests. As this structure is within the target kernel module’s global
region, we can use this information leak to obtain the address of its
kernel module (and thus any other variables within it).

### Obtaining a Kernel Write Primitive

The Linux kernel heap’s SLUB allocator maintains a cache of objects
of the same size (in powers of 2). Each free object in this cache
contains a pointer to the next free item in the cache (at offset 0 in
the free item). The exploit uses the heap overflow to modify the
freelist pointer at the beginning of the adjacent slab. By redirecting
this pointer, we can choose where the kernel will make an allocation. By
carefully choosing the allocation location and controlling the
allocations in this cache, the exploit obtains a limited kernel write
primitive. As explained in the next section, the exploit uses this
controlled write to modify the iscsi\_transport struct.

In order to obtain the desired heap layout, the exploit utilizes heap grooming via POSIX message [queue messages](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mq_overview.7.html).
The exploit operates on the 4096 kmalloc cache, which is a
comparatively low-traffic cache. As such, abusing the freelist to
redirect it to an arbitrary location is unlikely to cause issues.
Message queue messages were selected as the ideal heap grooming
allocation as they can be easily allocated/freed from userland, and
their contents and size can be mostly controlled from userland.

The exploit takes the following steps to obtain a kernel write primitive from the heap overflow:

1. Send a large number of message queue messages to ourselves, but
   do not receive them. This will cause the kernel to create the associated
   message queue structures in the kernel, flooding the 4096 kmalloc
   cache.
2. Receive a number of the message queue messages. This will cause
   the kernel to free the kernel message queue structures. If successful,
   the resulting 4096 kmalloc cache will contain a number of free items in a
   row, such as shown in the image (1) below.
3. The exploit triggers the overflow. The overflow allocation will
   take one of the cache’s free entries and overflow the next freelist
   pointer for the adjacent free item, as shown in (2) and (3) in the image
   below. The exploit uses the overflow to redirect the next freelist
   pointer to point at the `ib_iser` module’s `iscsi_transport` struct.
4. After the overflow, the exploit sends more message queue messages
   in order to reallocate the modified free item. The kernel will traverse
   the freelist and return an allocation at our modified freelist pointer,
   as shown in (4) in the image below.

[![Heap Grooming and Overflow Cache Layout](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2bau99gCf3A/YEq1HQ7nyzI/AAAAAAAABgU/yHR7MPVrhdYxnmUnudiUxkl0w7vofQG8ACLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/overflow.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2bau99gCf3A/YEq1HQ7nyzI/AAAAAAAABgU/yHR7MPVrhdYxnmUnudiUxkl0w7vofQG8ACLcBGAsYHQ/s691/overflow.png)

Heap Grooming and Overflow Cache Layout

While this approach does allow the exploit to write to kernel memory
at a controlled location, it does have a few caveats. The selected
location must start with a NULL pointer. Otherwise, the item’s
allocation will attempt to link the pointer at this value into the
freelist. Subsequent allocations will then use this pointer causing
memory corruption and likely a kernel panic. Additionally, the kernel
message queue structures include a header of 0x30 bytes before the user
controlled message body. As such, the exploit cannot control first 0x30
bytes that it writes.

### Target Selection and Exploitation

With KASLR bypassed and the ability to write to arbitrary content to
kernel memory, the next task is to use these primitives to obtain
stronger kernel read/write primitives and escalate privileges. In order
to do this, the exploit aims the arbitrary write at the `ib_iser` module’s `iscsi_transport`
structure. As shown below, this structure contains a number of iSCSI
netlink message handling function pointers, which the iSCSI subsystem
calls with partially user controlled parameters. By modifying these
function pointers, the exploit can call arbitrary functions with a few
user controlled parameters.

```
struct iscsi_transport {
  ...
  int (*alloc_pdu) (struct iscsi_task *task, uint8_t opcode);
  int (*xmit_pdu) (struct iscsi_task *task);
  ...
  int (*set_path) (struct Scsi_Host *shost, struct iscsi_path *params);
  int (*set_iface_param) (struct Scsi_Host *shost, void *data,
    uint32_t len);
  int (*send_ping) (struct Scsi_Host *shost, uint32_t iface_num,
    uint32_t iface_type, uint32_t payload_size,
    uint32_t pid, struct sockaddr *dst_addr);
  int (*set_chap) (struct Scsi_Host *shost, void *data, int len);
  int (*new_flashnode) (struct Scsi_Host *shost, const char *buf,
    int len);
  int (*del_flashnode) (struct iscsi_bus_flash_session *fnode_sess);
  ...
};
```
#### Obtaining a Stable Kernel Read/Write Primitive

The exploit modifies the `iscsi_transport` struct function pointers as shown in the below figure. After the modifications, the `send_ping` and `set_chap` function pointers point to the [`seq_buf_to_user`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.0/source/lib/seq_buf.c#L301) and [`seq_buf_putmem`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.0/source/lib/seq_buf.c#L188) functions. The exploit uses these functions to obtain a stable kernel read and write primitive. These functions take a `seq_buf` structure, buffer, and length as parameters, and then read or write to kernel memory respectively. The passed in `seq_buf`
defines where these functions will read from memory or write to memory.
However, as can be seen in the struct definition above, the overwritten
function pointers will pass a `Scsi_Host` struct as the first parameter, rather than the `seq_buf` that our exploit needs to provide. A simple workaround for this issue is to modify the `Scsi_Host` struct associated with our connection to resemble a `seq_buf` struct. As the beginning of the `Scsi_Host` struct does not contain any necessary values for the exploited functionality, the exploit uses the modified `set_iface_param` function pointer to call `memcpy` and overwrite the `Scsi_Host` struct. Afterwards, the `seq_buf_to_user` and `seq_buf_putmem` functions can be called to read or write kernel memory.

The exploit then uses the kernel read and write primitives to remove
the overlapping freelist region from the 4096 kmalloc cache and fix some
memory corruption that occurred as result of the overlapping
allocations.

#### Privilege Escalation

With the ability to call arbitrary functions and read/write kernel
memory, root privileges can be obtained in several different ways. The
exploit obtains privileged code execution by calling the kernel [`run_cmd`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.11.4/source/kernel/reboot.c#L424) function via a chained call to `param_array_free`. This kernel function takes a command to run and executes it as root in the `kernel_t` SELinux context. The exploit calls this function with a pointer to the `/tmp/a.sh` string in the `iscsi_transport`
struct, causing it to run the post-escalation payload. As neither the
privileged escalation or kernel read/write primitives directly
dereference or execute memory in userland from the kernel, the exploit
is able to bypass Supervisor Mode Execution Prevention (SMEP),
Supervisor Mode Access Prevention (SMAP), and Kernel Page Table
Isolation (KPTI).

While this exploit works on some Linux distributions, its technique
will not work on others. Other Linux distributions protect the free list
pointers in the heap to prevent exploitation (`CONFIG_SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED`).
This exploit takes advantage of the fact that some distributions do not
include this config option. The exploit will need to be reworked using
an alternative technique for this bug to be used to exploit a Linux
distribution with this option enabled.

## Testing

To test the provided PoC exploit, ensure you have a compatible RHEL
and kernel version. You can check your release version with cat `/etc/redhat-release`
and kernel version with uname -r, but the exploit will also detect and
warn if you are on an unsupported version. Install the required packages
and build the exploit, then copy the post-escalation script and run the
exploit:

```
$ sudo yum install -y make gcc
$ make
$ cp a.sh /tmp/
$ chmod +x /tmp/a.sh
$ ./exploit
```

The exploit concludes by running a script at a hardcoded location (`/tmp/a.sh`) as root. The repository includes a demonstration script which creates a file owned by root in `/tmp`.
The exploit is not 100% reliable, so may require multiple runs.
Possible error conditions include warnings such as “Failed to detect
kernel slide” and “Failed to overwrite iscsi\_transport struct (read
0x0)”, and kernel panics. Output from a successful run is shown below:

```
$ ./exploit
Got iscsi iser transport handle 0xffffffffc0e1a040
KERNEL_BASE=0xffffffff98600000
Setting up target heap buffer
Triggering overflow
Allocating controlled objects
Cleaning up
Running escalation payload
Success
```

Due to the way the PoC is written, additional attempts to run either
the same PoC or the send\_pdu\_oob PoC will fail gracefully (until the
system is restarted).

```
$ ls -l /tmp/proof
-rwsrwxrwx. 1 root root 14 Jan 14 10:09 /tmp/proof
```

A PoC for the third vulnerability was developed as well. The
send\_pdu\_oob PoC supplies a static large offset which causes a wild read
into (likely) unmapped kernel memory, which causes the kernel to panic.
The compiled PoC should be run with root privileges. Since the size and
offset of the data read are both controlled, this PoC could be adapted
to create an information leak by only leaking a small amount of
information beyond the original heap buffer. The primary restriction on
the usefulness of this bug is that the leaked data is not returned
directly to the user, but is stored in another buffer to be sent as part
of a later operation. It’s likely an attacker could design a dummy
iSCSI target to receive the leaked information, but that is beyond the
scope of this PoC.

# Impact

Due to the non-deterministic nature of heap overflows, the first
vulnerability could be used as an unreliable, local DoS. However, when
combined with an information leak, this vulnerability can be further
exploited as a LPE that allows an attacker to escalate from an
unprivileged user account to root. A separate information leak is not
necessary, though, since this vulnerability can be used to leak kernel
memory as well. The second vulnerability (kernel pointer leak) is less
impactful and could only serve as a potential information leak.
Similarly, the third vulnerability (out-of-bounds read) is also limited
to functioning as a potential information leak or even an unreliable
local DoS.

## Affected Systems

In order for these bugs to be exposed to userland, the
scsi\_transport\_iscsi kernel module must be loaded. This module is
automatically loaded when a socket call that creates a `NETLINK_ISCSI`
socket is performed. Additionally, at least one iSCSI transport must be
registered with the iSCSI subsystem. The ib\_iser transport module will
be loaded automatically in some configurations when an unprivileged user
creates a `NETLINK_RDMA` socket. Figure 5 shows a flowchart which helps to determine if you are impacted by this vulnerability.

[![Impact Flowchart](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7-vAGL2CyEg/YEq1Xud9ViI/AAAAAAAABgg/b6P9Vcpc4YYpeQhFdNK79aLAsytMldcUACLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/vuln_flowchart.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7-vAGL2CyEg/YEq1Xud9ViI/AAAAAAAABgg/b6P9Vcpc4YYpeQhFdNK79aLAsytMldcUACLcBGAsYHQ/s687/vuln_flowchart.png)Impact Flowchart

On CentOS 8, RHEL 8, and Fedora systems, unprivileged users can
automatically load the required modules if the rdma-core package is
installed. This package is a dependency of several popular packages, and
as such is included in a large number of systems. The following CentOS 8
and RHEL 8 Base Environments include this package in their initial
installation:

* Server with Graphical User Interface (GUI)
* Workstation
* Virtualized Host

The following CentOS 8 and RHEL 8 Base Environments do NOT include
this package in their initial installation, but it can be installed
afterwards via yum:

* Server
* Minimal Install
* Custom OS

The package is installed in the base install of Fedora 31 Workstation, but not Fedora 31 Server.

On Debian and Ubuntu systems, the rdma-core package will only
automatically load the two required kernel modules if the RDMA hardware
is available. As such, the vulnerability is much more limited in scope.

# Conclusions

The vulnerabilities discussed above are from a very old driver in the
Linux kernel. This driver became more visible due to a fairly new
technology (RDMA) and default behavior based on compatibility instead of
risk. The Linux kernel loads modules either because new hardware is
detected or because a kernel function detects that a module is missing.
The latter implicit autoload case is more likely to be abused and is
easily triggered by an attacker, enabling them to increase the attack
surface of the kernel.

In the context of these specific vulnerabilities, the presence of
loaded kernel modules relating to the iSCSI subsystem on machines that
don’t have attached iSCSI devices is a potential indicator of
compromise. An even greater indicator is the presence of the following
log message in a host’s system logs:

```
  localhost kernel: fill_read_buffer: dev_attr_show+0x0/0x40 returned bad count
```

While this message does not guarantee that the vulnerabilities
described in this report have been exploited, it does indicate that some
kind of buffer overflow has occurred.

This risk vector has been known for years, and there are several
defenses against module autoloading including grsecurity’s MODHARDEN and
the eventual mainstream implementation of modules\_autoload\_mode, the
modules\_disabled sysctl variable, distributions blacklisting particular
protocol families, and the use of machine-specific module blacklists.
These are separate options that can be used in a defense-in-depth
strategy, where server administrators and developers can take both
reactive and proactive measures.

The bottom line is that this is still a real problem area for the
Linux kernel because of the tension between compatibility and security.
Administrators and operators need to understand the risks, their
defensive options, and how to apply those options in order to
effectively protect their systems.

# GRIMM’s Private Vulnerability Disclosure (PVD) Program

GRIMM’s Private Vulnerability Disclosure (PVD) program is a
subscription-based vulnerability intelligence feed. This high-impact
feed serves as a direct pipeline from GRIMM’s vulnerability researchers
to its subscribers, facilitating the delivery of actionable intelligence
on 0-day threats as they are discovered by GRIMM. We created the PVD
program to allow defenders to get ahead of the curve, rather than always
having to react to events outside of their control.

The goal of this program is to provide value to subscribers in the following forms:

* Advanced notice of 0-days prior to public
  disclosure. This affords subscribers time to get mitigations in place
  before the information is publicly available.
* In-depth, technical documentation of each vulnerability.
* PoC vulnerability exploitation code for:

  + Verifying specific configurations are vulnerable
  + Testing defenses to determine their effectiveness in practice
  + Training

    - Blue teams on writing robust mitigations and detections
    - Red teams on the art of exploitation
* A list of any indicators of compromise
* A list of actionable mitigations that can be put in place to reduce the risk associated with each vulnerability.

The research is done entirely by GRIMM, and the software and hardware
selected by us is based on extensive threat modeling and our team’s
deep background in reverse engineering and vulnerability research.
Requests to look into specific software or hardware are welcome, however
we can not guarantee the priority of such requests. In addition to
publishing our research to subscribers, GRIMM also privately discloses
each vulnerability to its corresponding vendor(s) in an effort to help
patch the underlying issues.

At GRIMM, we do a lot of vulnerability and binary analysis research. As such, we often seek to automate some of the analysis steps and ease the burden on the individual researcher. One task which can be very mundane and time consuming for certain types of programs (C++, firmware, etc), is identifying structures' fields and applying the structure types to the corresponding functions within the decompiler. Thus, this summer we gave one of our interns,  Alex Lin , the task of developing a Ghidra plugin to automatically identify a binary's structs and mark up the decompilation accordingly. Alex's writeup below describes the results of the project, GEARSHIFT, which automates struct identification of function parameters by symbolically interpreting Ghidra's P-Code to determine how each parameter is accessed.

Netgear R7000 SOHO Device Exploitation After a long day of hard research, it’s fun to relax, kick back, and do something easy. While modern software development processes have vastly improved the quality of commercial software as compared to 10-15 years ago, consumer network devices have largely been left behind. Thus, when it’s time for some quick fun and a nice confidence boost, I like to analyze Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) devices. This blog describes one such session of auditing the Netgear R7000 router , analyzing the resulting vulnerability, and the exploit development process that followed. The write-up and code for the vulnerability described in this blog post can be found in our NotQuite0DayFriday repository. Initial Analysis The first step when analyzing a SOHO device is to obtain the firmware. Thankfully, Netgear’s support website hosts all of the firmwares for the R7000.

Message-ID: <20210306083924.GC26482@suse.de>

Subject: Linux iscsi security fixes

Hi,

The iscsi developers have just published 3 security fixes to Linux Kernel mainline git.

Reported-by: Adam Nichols <adam@...mm-co.com>

(I think) the researcher had requested CVEs, the kernel devs however ommitted them from the commits.

CVE-2021-27365: iscsi_host_get_param() allows sysfs params larger than 4k

	The linux kernel iscsi initiator code allows initiator/target parameters to be negotiated than can be longer than 4k, since no limit is imposed. But when these values are displayed via sysfs, the sysfs subsystem limits that output to 4k, so the memory above that gets leaked.

	<https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1182715>
	<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=ec98ea7070e94cc25a422ec97d1421e28d97b7ee>
	<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=f9dbdf97a5bd92b1a49cee3d591b55b11fd7a6d5>

	(not sure if both directly associated, but both fix the same class of issues)

(2 fixes in 1 upstream commit, just in 2 seperate hunks:)

CVE-2021-27363: kernel-source: show_transport_handle() shows iSCSI transport handle to non-root users

	The iscsi initiator kernel subsystem makes the transport handle available via sysfs so that the iscsid daemon can access it, but it makes this visible to all users, making it possible for non-root users to attack the iscsi subsystem using this knowledge, particularly together with CVE-2021-27364, which allows non-root users to user the netlink socket to talk to the iscsi kernel subsystem.

	<https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1182716>
	<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=688e8128b7a92df982709a4137ea4588d16f24aa>

CVE-2021-27364: kernel-source: iscsi_if_recv_msg() allows non-root users to connect and send commands
	This vulnerability allows any user to connect to the iscsi NETLINK socket and send commands to the kernel, such as "end a session", which is not good.

	Together with CVE-2021-27363, this allows non-root bad actors to end sessions arbitrarily. (See bsc#1182716).

Ciao, Marcus
