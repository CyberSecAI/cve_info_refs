{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The HTTP server has a backdoor API that allows enabling telnet access.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Backdoor in the HTTP server",
      "Lack of input validation on the 'key' parameter (uses only the last 6 characters of the mac address)",
        "Insecure firewall rules allowing access to the telnet server after enabling the backdoor",
        "Lack of authentication or authorization for the backdoor API"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass firewall rules and gain access to the CLI telnet server on the device, enabling further exploitation, such as privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP request to the `/telnet` API with the 'enable' parameter set to 1 and the 'key' parameter set to the last 6 characters of the BR0 mac address"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know or be able to deduce the last 6 characters of the BR0 MAC address. This information can be obtained by accessing the `/info.asp` page of the web server without authentication, or by making an educated guess based on the WAN MAC address, which is typically similar."
