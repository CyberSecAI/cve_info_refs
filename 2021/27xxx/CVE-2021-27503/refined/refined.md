Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-27503

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of hard-coded secrets for encryption at the application layer in the communication protocol between the Ypsomed mylife App and mylife Cloud. This means the encryption keys are static and embedded within the application, rather than being dynamically generated or securely stored.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798):** The application relies on hardcoded secrets for encryption, making the encryption mechanism easily compromised.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Tampering:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to tamper with messages transmitted between the Ypsomed mylife App and mylife Cloud. This could potentially involve modifying health data or other sensitive information.
- **Data Exposure:** Although not explicitly stated, with the ability to tamper, there is a potential for the attacker to intercept and potentially decrypt the messages which could lead to exposure of sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-middle (MitM) Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable via man-in-the-middle attacks. An attacker positioned between the application and the cloud can intercept and modify encrypted traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Interception:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept network traffic between the Ypsomed mylife App and mylife Cloud. This typically involves being on the same network or having control over routing.
- **Understanding of Protocol:** A basic understanding of the communication protocol is required to identify the encrypted data and how to modify it.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the application layer encryption of the communication protocol between the Ypsomed mylife App and mylife Cloud
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 5.4 with a vector string of (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).
- Affected products are all versions of Ypsomed mylife Cloud prior to 1.7.2, and all versions of the Ypsomed mylife App prior to 1.7.5.
- The report was made by Julian Suleder, Linda Huischen, and Nils Emmerich of ERNW Research GmbH and Dr. Oliver Matula of Enno Rey Netzwerke GmbH (ERNW) in the context of the BSI project ManiMed.
