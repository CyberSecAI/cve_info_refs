The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied value before it is dereferenced as a pointer within the `win32kfull.sys` driver. In one specific case, a NULL pointer dereference occurs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Untrusted pointer dereference.
- Improper input validation
- NULL pointer dereference (in one case)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attack.
- An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- The attacker must be able to execute low-privileged code.
