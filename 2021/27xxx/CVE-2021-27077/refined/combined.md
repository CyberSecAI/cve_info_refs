# Advisory Details

April 29th, 2021
## Microsoft Windows win32kfull MulFillPath Untrusted Pointer Dereference Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

### ZDI-21-498ZDI-CAN-12573

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-27077](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-27077) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Windows |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the win32kfull.sys driver. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied value prior to dereferencing it as a pointer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2020-12-23 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2021-04-29 - Coordinated public release of advisory |
