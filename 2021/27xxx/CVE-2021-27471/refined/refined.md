{
  "CVE-2021-27471": {
    "Root cause": "The parsing mechanism in Connected Components Workbench that processes certain file types does not sanitize file paths.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal (CWE-22)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can craft malicious files that, when opened by Connected Components Workbench, can traverse the file system, overwrite existing files, and create new files with the same permissions as the software.",
    "Attack vectors": "Malicious files opened by the software.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious file. User interaction is required for exploitation, meaning the user must open the crafted file within the software.",
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability can lead to overwriting of existing files or creation of new files with the software's privileges, potentially allowing further malicious actions."
