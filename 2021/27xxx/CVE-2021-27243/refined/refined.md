Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-27243

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability exists within the Toolgate component of Parallels Desktop.
*   The root cause is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, leading to an integer overflow before allocating a buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Integer overflow.
*   Insufficient input validation.
*   Privilege escalation vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor. This means an attacker could gain full control over the virtual machine and potentially the host system.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Local access is required. An attacker must first have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   An attacker needs to execute low-privileged code within the guest operating system.

**Additional Details:**
* Parallels has released an update to address the vulnerability, according to the advisory.
* The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2020-09-30.
* The coordinated public release of the advisory was on 2021-02-24.

**More Detail than CVE:**
The provided content gives more specific details than the typical CVE description would, such as the affected component (Toolgate) and the root cause of the vulnerability (integer overflow due to lack of proper input validation). The provided content also specifies the need for initial low-privileged code execution on the target system.
