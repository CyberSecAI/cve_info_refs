- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of contact's first and last names when rendering the contact's details page. These fields are used in a context that allows execution of javascript when hovering over the "Campaigns" button in the action drop down.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unsanitized user input. Specifically, inline JavaScript can be injected through the contact's first or last name.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to inject malicious JavaScript code into the first or last name fields of a contact. This can be done through the UI, API, 3rd party syncing, forms, or any other method that allows modifying contact information. The vulnerability is then triggered when viewing a contact's details page and hovering over the "Campaigns" button in the action drop-down menu.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to modify contact information. The user needs to interact with the malicious content by viewing the contact and hovering over the button.
