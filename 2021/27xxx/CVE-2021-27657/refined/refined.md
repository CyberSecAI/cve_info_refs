    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "Improper privilege management in Metasys servers, engines, and tools.",
      "Weaknesses": "The software does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges, leading to an unintended sphere of control for authenticated users.",
      "Impact": "An authenticated Metasys user could gain unintended access to the server file system, potentially allowing them to access or modify system files by sending specially crafted web messages to the Metasys system.",
       "Attack vectors": "Remotely exploitable vulnerability. Attackers would require an authenticated Metasys user account to exploit it. The attack is carried out by sending crafted web messages.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a valid, authenticated user of the Metasys system, with low attack complexity."
