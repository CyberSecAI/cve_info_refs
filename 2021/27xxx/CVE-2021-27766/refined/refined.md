{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The HCL BigFix Client for Windows installation process uses the Windows Installer framework and caches an MSI file in c:\\windows\\installer. An unprivileged user can trigger a repair operation which will cause file operations to be performed in the user's %TEMP% directory from a SYSTEM context, including the execution of temporary files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions (CWE-379)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local privilege escalation, allowing an unprivileged attacker to gain SYSTEM level privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "Triggering a repair operation of the HCL BigFix Client, either through the Windows Installer API or by executing `msiexec.exe /fa c:\\windows\\installer\\[XXXXX].msi`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Any authenticated local user can exploit the vulnerability."
