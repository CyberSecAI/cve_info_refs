The provided content includes a blog post that discusses two vulnerabilities in Telegram for macOS, one of which is assigned CVE-2021-27205.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Telegram for macOS application (version 7.3 (211334) Stable) stores a local copy of received audio/video messages in a custom path, even after those messages are deleted/disappeared from secret chats.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Failure to properly remove local copies of self-destructing media messages.
- Information Leakage: The application leaks the sandbox path where recorded messages are stored.
-  Storage of self-destructing media even when the message is supposed to have disappeared.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Privacy violation: An attacker could potentially access media intended to be self-destructed.
- Data compromise: Local copies of the supposedly deleted media could be recovered from the storage location by an unauthorized user.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access to the file system of the macOS device where Telegram is installed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  Physical or remote access to the macOS device where Telegram application is installed.
- Ability to browse the file system of the macOS device.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was patched in version 7.4 (212543) Stable of Telegram for macOS.
- The blog post mentions that a 3000 EUR bounty was awarded for reporting this vulnerability.
- It also mentions that the same version of Telegram stored the local passcode in plain text.
