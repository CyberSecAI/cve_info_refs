Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application lacked proper input validation in its APIs, allowing arbitrary commands to be injected and executed on the server. Specifically, the `ContainerController.js` and `terminal.js` files were vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The application directly concatenated user-supplied input (container/image names and commands) into shell commands without sanitization, which were then executed using `child_process.exec`.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application did not validate user inputs to ensure they only contained allowed characters or matched expected patterns for container/image names and commands.
- **Network Accessibility:** The application's API was accessible over the network by default, increasing the severity of the command injection vulnerability as it could be exploited remotely.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers could execute any command on the server with the privileges of the user running the application.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Given that the API was network accessible, this enabled remote code execution.
- **Data Exfiltration/System Compromise:** Attackers could potentially exfiltrate sensitive data, gain further access to the system, or cause denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** Attackers could inject commands through GET request parameters to the vulnerable API endpoints, such as `/api/container/command` and `/api/image/command`.
- **Manipulating `container` and `command` parameters:**  By crafting malicious values for these parameters, attackers could inject and execute arbitrary shell commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needed network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of API Endpoints:** The attacker required knowledge of the vulnerable API endpoints to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Basic Understanding of Shell Commands:** The attacker needed knowledge of shell commands to execute malicious actions.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by implementing a `safeTerminal` method that sanitizes user input by checking if the container/image IDs are alphanumeric and by restricting the allowed commands. The `safeTerminal` method uses regular expressions (`isValidId`, `isValidString`) to validate user-provided IDs and task parameters before executing any command.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was initially reported on January 31, 2021, and fixed by February 28, 2021, with the fix committed as commit `79cdc41809f2030fce21a1109898bd79e4190661`.
- The fix introduces a controlled method of executing queries which introduces validation for container IDs and command tasks before passing them to the `Terminal()` function for execution.
- The code changes can be viewed in the diff for `backend/utilities/terminal.js`, which shows the introduction of validation functions, and the `safeTerminal` object.
- CVE-2021-27886 was assigned to this issue.
