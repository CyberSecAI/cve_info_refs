The provided content is a proof of concept (POC) for CVE-2021-27529, detailing an XSS vulnerability in DynPG version 4.9.2.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "limit" parameter within the DynPG admin panel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, potentially leading to:
  - Social engineering attacks by redirecting users to fake websites.
  - Stealing user cookies, potentially leading to account takeover.
  - Downloading malware onto users' systems.
  - Other malicious actions an attacker can perform with XSS.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted URL with a malicious JavaScript payload within the "limit" parameter of the `popup.php` script. Specifically, the attacker manipulates the `limit` parameter in the URL: `https://localhost/dynpg/backendpopup/popup.php?limit=%27"--></style></scRipt><scRipt>alert(2)</scRipt>&orderby=3&page=3&popUpResource=images&query=3&refID=3&returnCall=3&sort=3&valueID=3`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
  - The attacker needs to know that the DynPG application is vulnerable.
  - The user needs to be logged in to the DynPG admin panel.
