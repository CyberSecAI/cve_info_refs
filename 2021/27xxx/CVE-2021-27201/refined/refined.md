Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27201:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in the backup creation functionality of the Endian Firewall Community version 3.3.2. Specifically, the "comment" field in the backup creation process is not properly sanitized, allowing for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary commands into the system through the vulnerable "comment" field.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the affected system.
* **"nobody" User Context:** The injected commands are executed with the privileges of the "nobody" user. While not root access, this still enables a range of malicious activities depending on the system configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Web Interface:** The attack is launched through the web interface of the Endian Firewall.
* **Backup Creation Functionality:** The specific entry point is the backup creation process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a valid user with the ability to log in to the web application.

**Technical Details and Steps:**
1. **Login:** The attacker logs into the web application.
2. **Initiate Backup:**  The attacker begins creating a backup through the web interface.
3. **Inject Command:** In the backup configuration, specifically within the comment field, the attacker injects a command. For example: `aaaa$(id)bbbb`
4. **Trigger Backup:**  The attacker starts the backup process. This triggers the injected command.
5. **Command Execution:** The system executes the command within the context of the backup process and with the privileges of the "nobody" user.
