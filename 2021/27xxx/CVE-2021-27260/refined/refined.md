Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2021-27260:

**Root Cause:**
* The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the Toolgate component of Parallels Desktop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* Out-of-bounds read: The insufficient input validation can lead to reading beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries. This allows for disclosure of sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* Information disclosure: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read sensitive information from the system's memory.
* Potential privilege escalation: An attacker can potentially leverage this vulnerability in combination with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and gain arbitrary code execution capabilities within the hypervisor's context.

**Attack Vectors:**
* Local Attack: The vulnerability is exploitable by a local attacker with high privileges on the target guest system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* High-privileged access: The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code with high privileges on the guest operating system in order to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* Parallels released an update to address this vulnerability.
* The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2020-10-06 and publicly disclosed on 2021-02-24.
* The vulnerability was discovered by Reno Robert of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
* The affected product is Parallels Desktop, specifically within the Toolgate component.
* The advisory mentions "in conjunction with other vulnerabilities", implying that this vulnerability alone may not be sufficient for full system compromise, but a step in a larger attack chain.
