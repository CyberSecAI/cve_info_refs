### **[alimpfard](/alimpfard)** commented [Feb 14, 2021](#issuecomment-778723219)

| I think I'll write a new ASN.1 parser, and hopefully avoid the footguns of raw pointers (we now have `ReadonlyBytes`!) Not sure when I'll manage to get to that one though; if anyone feels like doing this (or fixing this issue), go right ahead! |

### @alimpfard **[alimpfard](/alimpfard)** commented [Feb 14, 2021](#issue-807941432) • edited Loading

A modern, good-looking parser (that actually works)!

Should very likely fix [#5317](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/issues/5317) and most other ASN.1/DER parser related bugs.

Hopefully sometime soon, I'll replace the hacky X509 certificate parser in LibTLS with this parser too.

Update: does fix [#5317](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/issues/5317).

Sorry, something went wrong.
