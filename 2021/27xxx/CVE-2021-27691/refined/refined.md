- **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    - **Remote Command Injection:** The `formSetDebugCfg` function does not filter user-supplied input for the `pEnable`, `pLevel`, and `pModule` parameters, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands.
    - **Buffer Overflow:** The `formSetDebugCfg` function uses `sprintf` to copy the `pEnable` parameter into a local stack variable without proper bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Command Injection:** Lack of input sanitization in the `formSetDebugCfg` function allows the injection of arbitrary commands.
    - **Buffer Overflow:** Unbounded copy of user-controlled data into a fixed-size stack buffer.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Remote Command Injection:** An attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands on the router, potentially gaining full control of the device.
    - **Buffer Overflow:** The buffer overflow can overwrite the function's return address, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - **Remote Command Injection & Buffer Overflow:** Crafted HTTP GET requests to the `/action/setDebugCfg` endpoint, with malicious values for the `enable`, `level`, or `module` parameters.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the router's web interface. This typically means the attacker needs to be on the same network or have network access to the router's web interface.
