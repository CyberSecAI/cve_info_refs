## Vulnerability description
We found an Command Injection vulnerability and buffer overflow vulnerability in Tenda Technology Tenda's \*\*G1 and G3\*\* routers with firmware which was released recently，allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands from a crafted GET request.
### Remote Command Injection vulnerability
In \*\*formSetDebugCfg\*\* function, the parameter \*\*"pEnable"\*\* is not filter the string delivered by the user, so we can control the \*\*pEnable\*\* such as \*\*"aaa;ping x.x.x.x;"\*\* to attack the OS, and so on, we also can control the \*\*pLevel\*\* or \*\*pModule\*\* to attack it.
### Buffer Overflow vulnerability
In \*\*formSetDebugCfg\*\* function, the parameter \*\*"pEnable"\*\* is directly \*\*sprintf\*\* to a local variable placed on the stack, which overrides the return address of the function, causing buffer overflow, and so on, we also can control the \*\*pLevel\*\* or \*\*pModule\*\* to attack it.

## PoC
### Remote Command Injection
We set the value of \*\*enable\*\* as \*\*aaa;ping x.x.x.x;\*\* and the router will excute \*\*ping\*\* command.
```example.com/action/setDebugCfg?enable=aaa;ping x.x.x.x;```

### Buffer Overflow
We set the value of \*\*enable\*\* as \*\*aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa……\*\* and the router will cause buffer overflow.
