# CVE-2021-27219 (GHSL-2021-045): integer overflow in g\_bytes\_new/g\_memdup

# GitHub Security Lab (GHSL) Vulnerability Report: `GHSL-2021-045`

The [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com) team has identified a potential security vulnerability in [GLib](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib).

We are committed to working with you to help resolve these issues. In this report you will find everything you need to effectively coordinate a resolution of these issues with the GHSL team.

If at any point you have concerns or questions about this process, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at `securitylab@github.com` (please include `GHSL-2021-045` as a reference).

If you are *NOT* the correct point of contact for this report, please let us know!

## Summary

The function [`g_bytes_new`](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/2.67.2/glib/gbytes.c#L93) has an integer overflow due to an implicit cast from 64 bits to 32 bits. The overflow could potentially lead to a memory corruption vulnerability.

## Product

GLib

## Tested Versions

* Ubuntu 20.04 (x86\_64): version 2.64.6-1
* CentOS Stream (x86\_64): version 2.56.4-9
* archlinux (x86\_64): 2.66.4-2

## Details

### Issue 1: Integer overflow in g\_bytes\_new (GHSL-2021-045)

On 64-bit platforms, an integer overflow can occur in `g_bytes_new`, due to an implicit cast from `gsize` to `guint`. The overflow happens in the call to `g_memdup` ([gbytes.c, line 98](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/2.67.2/glib/gbytes.c#L98)). The reason is that `size` is a 64-bit `gsize`, but `g_memdup` takes a 32-bit `guint`.

```
GBytes *
g_bytes_new (gconstpointer data,
             gsize         size)
{
  g_return_val_if_fail (data != NULL || size == 0, NULL);

  return g_bytes_new_take (g_memdup (data, size), size);  <===  integer overflow
}
```

When the overflow occurs, it does not cause the code to crash immediately. Instead, `g_memdup` creates a much smaller buffer than it should. This causes `g_bytes_new` to return a `GBytes` object containing a much smaller data buffer than it's size would suggest. For example, if `size` is `0x100000008` then `g_bytes_new` will return a `GBytes` object that claims to contain a 4GB buffer, but actually contains an 8 byte buffer.

We have attached a proof-of-concept which demonstrates that it is possible to trigger the overflow. The proof-of-concept triggers the overflow via `polkit-agent-helper-1`, which is a SUID binary. Luckily the poc only causes `polkit-agent-helper-1` to crash with a `SIGABRT`, due to an assertion failure. However, GLib is a very widely used library, so it is possible that other attack vectors exist.

To run the poc:

```
gcc polkithelperabort.c -o polkithelperabort
./polkithelperabort <username>
```

The poc will ask for the user's password, which is sent to `polkit-agent-helper-1` in the normal way, along with a 4GB "cookie", which triggers the overflow. Although the poc will only work with a valid password, it will work for any user account. So if you are worried about plugging a genuine password into the poc, just create a temporary user account for running the poc, and delete it when you are done.

The poc should trigger an assertion failure, with an error message like this:

```
GLib-GIO:ERROR:../glib/gio/gdbusmessage.c:2399:append_value_to_blob: assertion failed: (g_utf8_validate (v, -1, &end) && (end == v + len))
Bail out! GLib-GIO:ERROR:../glib/gio/gdbusmessage.c:2399:append_value_to_blob: assertion failed: (g_utf8_validate (v, -1, &end) && (end == v + len))
```

#### Impact

The poc which we have provided only causes a harmless crash. We are not currently aware of an exploitable attack vector for this issue. However, there is a risk that it could lead to memory corruption vulnerability, which could potentially be used to gain code execution in an application that uses GLib.

#### Remediation

The issue looks easy to fix by changing the type of the `byte_size` parameter of `g_memdup`, so we have a posted a [merge request](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/merge_requests/1924 "Change type of byte_size to fix integer overflow.") with that change.

Package        : glib2.0
Version        : 2.50.3-2+deb9u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-27218 CVE-2021-27219 CVE-2021-28153
Debian Bug     : 984969 982778 982779

Several security vulnerabilities were found in glib2.0, a general-purpose
utility library for the GNOME environment.

CVE-2021-27218

  If g_byte_array_new_take() was called with a buffer of 4GB or more on a
  64-bit platform, the length would be truncated modulo 2**32, causing
  unintended length truncation.

CVE-2021-27219

  The function g_bytes_new has an integer overflow on 64-bit platforms due to
  an implicit cast from 64 bits to 32 bits. The overflow could potentially
  lead to memory corruption.

CVE-2021-28153

  When g_file_replace() is used with G_FILE_CREATE_REPLACE_DESTINATION to
  replace a path that is a dangling symlink, it incorrectly also creates the
  target of the symlink as an empty file, which could conceivably have
  security relevance if the symlink is attacker-controlled. (If the path is
  a symlink to a file that already exists, then the contents of that file
  correctly remain unchanged.)

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.50.3-2+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your glib2.0 packages.

For the detailed security status of glib2.0 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/glib2.0>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
