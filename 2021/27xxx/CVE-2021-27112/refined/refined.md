The content is related to CVE-2021-27112.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `catchImage` function in LightCMS v1.3.5 does not properly filter external image URLs, allowing an attacker to download arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** The lack of filtering allows an attacker to specify a URL to any file, which the server then downloads and saves. This could include sensitive system files.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By downloading a malicious PHP file to a web-accessible directory, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server.
- An attacker can achieve remote code execution by downloading and executing malicious code on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is carried out by providing a crafted URL to the `catchImage` function that points to an attacker-controlled file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the `catchImage` function of the LightCMS application and supply arbitrary URLs.
