Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-27244

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the Toolgate component of Parallels Desktop. This inadequate validation leads to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The core issue is the ability to read data beyond the allocated buffer due to the lack of input validation.
*   **Information Disclosure:** This vulnerability enables an attacker to disclose sensitive information residing in the memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive data from memory, potentially gaining access to confidential information.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although not directly leading to code execution, the advisory mentions that an attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the hypervisor.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Attack:** This is a local vulnerability, requiring the attacker to have access to the guest system.
*   **Low-Privileged Code Execution:** The attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the guest system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to a Parallels Desktop guest system.
*   **Low-Privilege Code Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code with low privileges on the guest OS.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is located in the Toolgate component.
*   Parallels has released an update to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2020-09-30 and publicly disclosed on 2021-02-24.
* The Parallels KB article lists  ZDI-CAN-11925 as related to this CVE, but does not provide specific details about the fix.
