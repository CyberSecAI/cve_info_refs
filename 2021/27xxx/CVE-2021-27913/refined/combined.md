# Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm

Low

[RCheesley](/RCheesley)
published
GHSA-x7g2-wrrp-r6h3
Aug 30, 2021

## Package

mautic/core
(PHP)

## Affected versions

< 3.3.4, < 4.0.0-rc

## Patched versions

3.3.4, 4.0.0

## Description

## ✍️ Description

The function mt\_rand is used to generate session tokens, this function is cryptographically flawed due to its nature being one pseudorandomness, an attacker can take advantage of the cryptographically insecure nature of this function to enumerate session tokens for accounts that are not under his/her control

## 🕵️‍♂️ Proof of Concept

Numerous examples and attack implementations can be found in this paper . If you're looking for a practical tool that can crack your mt\_rand implementation's seed value, see this project and run the following commands in a console with php5 and OpenWall's tool installed:

`root$ php -r 'mt_srand(13333337); echo mt_rand( ), "\n";'`

After that, copy the output (1863134308) and execute the following commands:

`root$ gcc php_mt_seed.c -o php_mt_seedroot$ ./php_mt_seed 1863134308`

After waiting ~1 minute you should have a few possible seeds corresponding to their PHP versions, next to your installed PHP version you should see something akin to:

seed = 0x00cb7359 = 13333337 (PHP 7.1.0+)

Hey, that's your seed!

## 💥 Impact

An attacker could takeover accounts at random by enumerating and using access tokens.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
