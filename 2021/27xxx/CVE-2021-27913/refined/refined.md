- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The function `mt_rand` is used to generate session tokens. This function is cryptographically flawed because it is based on pseudorandomness.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of a cryptographically insecure pseudorandom number generator (`mt_rand`) for generating session tokens.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can enumerate and use session tokens, potentially leading to account takeover.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks. An attacker can try to predict the session tokens by exploiting the predictable nature of `mt_rand`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs a way to see generated tokens
    - The attacker needs to be able to execute code to determine the seed used.
    - A low level of privileges is required (attacker requires a valid account).
    - User interaction is required
