- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An XSS vulnerability exists due to a vulnerable parameter, "bundle," in the password reset URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The "bundle" parameter in the password reset URL is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser session when the user clicks the crafted password reset URL. This can lead to various malicious actions, such as session hijacking, data theft, or phishing attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker needs to craft a malicious password reset URL with the vulnerable "bundle" parameter containing malicious Javascript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious password reset URL and convince the target user to click on the crafted link.
