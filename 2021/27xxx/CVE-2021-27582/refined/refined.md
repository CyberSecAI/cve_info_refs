```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `OAuthConfirmationController` in MITREid Connect uses `@ModelAttribute` on the `authorizationRequest` parameter, which binds HTTP request parameters to the object. This allows an attacker to manipulate the authorization request parameters during the confirmation step.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Mass assignment vulnerability in Spring MVC due to improper use of @ModelAttribute.",
    "Session poisoning",
    "Bypass of authorization checks."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass the authorization checks by manipulating the redirect_uri parameter on the confirmation page. This allows them to redirect the user to a malicious site after successful authentication and steal the authorization token, potentially leading to account compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts two links, one to the `/authorize` endpoint and another to the `/oauth/confirm_access` endpoint, each with different `redirect_uri` parameters. The second link uses the mass assignment vulnerability to overwrite the session's `authorizationRequest` object.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to know a valid client ID that the user trusts and needs the user to visit the crafted links. No special access or credentials are required initially, except that the user must have an account on the system and trust a client."
