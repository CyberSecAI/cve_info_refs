{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user input provided through the URI, specifically within the `index.php` file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform social engineering attacks by redirecting users to fake websites, steal cookies leading to account takeover, download malware on user systems, and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious URI that includes a JavaScript payload. This malicious URI is then used to access the vulnerable `index.php` page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious URLs and induce a user to visit such a URL. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the server."
