- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The FX Aggregator terminal client stores authentication credentials in cleartext in the `login.sav` file when the "Save Password" option is checked.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials. Credentials are not encrypted or hashed before being stored.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Information disclosure of user credentials. An attacker gaining access to the `login.sav` file can obtain user passwords.
- **Attack vectors:** Local file access to the `login.sav` file. This could be achieved through various means, such as malware, social engineering or physical access to the system where the client is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the filesystem where the vulnerable application stores its data (specifically the login.sav file).
