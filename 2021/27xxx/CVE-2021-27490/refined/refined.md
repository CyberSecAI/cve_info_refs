Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-27490:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing JT files within Siemens Solid Edge Viewer. This insufficient validation leads to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125):** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, meaning the software attempts to read data from a memory location outside the bounds of the allocated buffer or data structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, effectively gaining control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File:** The attack vector involves a user opening a malicious JT file.
*   **Malicious Page:** The user visiting a malicious page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious JT file or host a malicious page that, when processed by the vulnerable application, triggers the out-of-bounds read.
*   User Interaction: Exploitation requires user interaction, either by opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious website.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by rgod of Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
*   The vulnerability exists in Siemens Solid Edge Viewer.
*   The vulnerability was disclosed publicly as a 0-day due to the vendor not providing a patch within the ZDI's disclosure deadline.
*   The vulnerability is also present in a third-party library (Datakit CrossCADWare) that is bundled with Luxion KeyShot. This means that applications using the vulnerable version of the Datakit library are affected.
* The affected Datakit library versions are 2021.1 and earlier.
* The vulnerability in the third party library is also present in KeyShot versions v10.1 and prior.
* A patch is available in Datakit CrossCAD/Ware library Version 2021.2 and later.
* Luxion KeyShot has been updated to v10.2 to include the patched Datakit libraries.

**CVSS Score:** 7.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
