**Verification:**

The provided content includes a GitHub repository named "PoC-BrokenAuth-AppSpace6.2.4" which refers to a "Broken Authentication" issue in "AppSpace version 6.2.4". While the CVE is a placeholder, the information within the github repo relates to a broken authentication issue which could be part of a vulnerability addressed by CVE-2021-27990.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The core issue is a broken authentication vulnerability. Specifically, pages within the AppSpace application can be accessed directly without proper authentication.
*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is insufficient access control. The application fails to enforce proper authorization checks before allowing access to certain pages (e.g., `/medianet/mail.aspx`). This allows unauthenticated users to bypass the intended access flow.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Framework:** Direct access to pages reveals the application's framework, layouts, menus, and functionalities.
    *   **Session Data Theft:** The vulnerability enables the theft of session data, such as cookie information, which can be used to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   **Functionality Discovery:** Attackers can explore the application's available and implemented functionalities.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Directly accessing application pages (e.g., `/medianet/mail.aspx`) without prior authentication.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to know (or guess) the URL of a vulnerable page.
    *   The attacker does not need to be an authenticated user.

**Additional Information:**

*   The GitHub repository includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the broken authentication issue.
*   The specific version affected is AppSpace 6.2.4.
*   The vulnerability allows for both unauthorized access and information exposure.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a broken authentication issue in AppSpace version 6.2.4, allowing unauthenticated users to directly access pages and potentially steal session data, which can lead to unauthorized access and discovery of functionalities.
