- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Uncontrolled recursion in the affected OPC UA products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uncontrolled recursion (CWE-674) leading to a potential stack overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could trigger a stack overflow, leading to a denial of service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely with low attack complexity.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require any privileges and no user interaction is necessary.
