Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-27005:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The advisory from NetApp clearly states that **CVE-2021-27005** is a Denial of Service vulnerability affecting Clustered Data ONTAP.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is a vulnerability in Clustered Data ONTAP that allows a remote attacker to crash the `httpd` server. The specific details of the underlying flaw aren't provided, but it resides within the httpd component.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - The core weakness is a flaw that can be exploited through a remote attack vector that directly impacts the availability of the httpd server.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - Successful exploitation leads to a **Denial of Service (DoS)** condition. This means the affected ONTAP system would become unavailable due to the crash of its web server component.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector is **remote**, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability from a network location, and it doesn't require local access to the system.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker requires a network connection to the affected system.
   - The attacker does not need to be authenticated (i.e., `PR:N` in CVSS vector).
   - The attack does not require user interaction (`UI:N`).

**Additional Technical Details:**
  - The vulnerability is present in Clustered Data ONTAP versions 9.6 and higher before the specific patch releases: 9.6P16, 9.7P16, 9.8P7, and 9.9.1P3.
  - The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 5.3 (MEDIUM), with a vector string of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L`.
  - NetApp is aware of public discussion of the vulnerability.
  - Patches are available for the affected versions, downloadable from the NetApp Support website. No workarounds are provided.
  - The advisory explicitly lists numerous NetApp products that are *not* affected by this specific vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2021-27005 allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a DoS on specific versions of NetApp Clustered Data ONTAP by crashing the httpd server.
