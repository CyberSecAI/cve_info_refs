The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in ZenTao CMS, and CVE-2021-27558 is specifically mentioned as being related to a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

*   **Root cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `data-link-creator` field, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient input sanitization, lack of output encoding.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a ZenTao page. When an authenticated user visits the crafted URL, the script will execute in their browser, allowing the attacker to perform actions on the application as the victim user (in this case, an admin). This can lead to account takeover and further exploitation.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `data-link-creator` field, and then tricks a user (specifically an admin) into clicking this link.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick an admin user to click on it. The attacker does not need any prior authentication.

**Additional context from the document regarding the exploit chain:**

The XSS vulnerability is used in combination with a CSRF vulnerability to achieve remote code execution. The CSRF vulnerability, assigned CVE-2021-27557, allows attackers to modify a cron job setting, specifically the job type. The cron job vulnerability itself, CVE-2021-27556, allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands if the cron job type is set to system.

The exploit chain is:

1.  **XSS:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL that injects JavaScript into a ZenTao page, by manipulating the `data-link-creator` field.
2.  **CSRF:** The JavaScript makes a cross-site request to the server (from the admin's browser) to modify the cron job and set its type to `system` using the CSRF vulnerability (no CSRF protection).
3.  **RCE:**  Once the cron job type is set to `system` using CSRF and XSS, the system will execute an attacker supplied command. This command is a touch command to create a file to trigger admin password reset, allowing the attacker to subsequently login as admin and further execute arbitrary commands using the cron functionality by editing it's command.
