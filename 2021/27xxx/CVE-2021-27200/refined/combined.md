# Exploit Title: WoWonder Social Network Platform 3.1 - Authentication Bypass
# Date: 11.06.2021
# Exploit Author: securityforeveryone.com
# Researchers : Security For Everyone Team - https://securityforeveryone.com
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.wowonder.com/
# Software Link: https://codecanyon.net/item/wowonder-the-ultimate-php-social-network-platform/13785302
# Version: < 3.1
# Tested on: Linux/Windows

'''
DESCRIPTION

In WoWonder < 3.1, remote attackers can take over any account due to the weak cryptographic algorithm in recover.php. The code parameter is easily predicted from the time of day.
The vulnerability is found the "code" parameter in password reset link. The password reset code can be estimated by combining the password reset link time and the random value generated between 111 and 999.
if an attacker exploits this vulnerability, attacker may access all accounts in WoWonder application.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

##### Brockied

Very impressed with the script it was easy to install and looks clean. Support was super quick! I have tried other social network scripts before, some that cost over $200 but this has to be the cleanest and most user friendly I have used. Look forward to see what new features come, can only expect good stuff from this script. I recommend 100% take my word just buy it you wont be disappointed.

## **WoWonder Social Network Platform 0-day Authentication Bypass Vulnerability (CVE-2021-27200)**

[Wowonder](https://codecanyon.net/item/wowonder-the-ultimate-php-social-network-platform/13785302) is a web application software written using the PHP programming language that allows you to create your social networking platform. When the software is purchased through [codecanyon](https://codecanyon.net/item/wowonder-the-ultimate-php-social-network-platform/13785302), the source code will be included, and you will be able to run the software on your server. The application received an update and was released with a 3.1 version number after we notified the vulnerabilities that we found to the vendor.

As a result of our research on the Wowonder social network platform application, we detected an Authentication Bypass vulnerability caused by the "code" parameter in the password reset link.

Remote attackers can take over any account due to the weak cryptographic algorithm in recover.php file. The code parameter is easily predicted from the time of day.

If an attacker exploits this vulnerability, the attacker may access all accounts in the WoWonder application.

**How Did We Detect Wowonder Social Network Platform Authentication Bypass Vulnerability?**

As the Security For Everyone team, we regularly look for vulnerabilities in the software we have chosen to find 0-day. One of the software we chose was the Wowonder Social Network Platform web application, which serves as a social media platform. After deciding on the application that we are going to look for vulnerability, we performed the following steps in order:

* We decided to manually examine the source codes of the application purchased on Codecanyon after seeing that examining it with automatic source code analysis tools produced too many false positives.
* We determined that all requests are sent to the requests.php page by taking the function name as a parameter (requests.php?f=recover).
* We have seen that the "code" parameter in the password reset link is easily predicted from the time of day. The password reset code can be estimated by combining the password reset link time and the random value generated between 111 and 999.
* We discovered that the vulnerability could be triggered when we sent the estimated reset code to the password reset page.
* Using the Authentication Bypass vulnerability we detected, we were able to access all accounts in the WoWonder application

Finally, we applied to [Mitre](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html) and got our CVE code.

**What To Do?**

After detecting the vulnerability, we reported the vulnerability to the Wowonder software team. Then, they fixed the vulnerability and updated the new version on Codecanyon. Downloading the current version and using it on your systems is recommended by the Security For Everyone team.
