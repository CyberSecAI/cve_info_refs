Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-27815:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a bug in `exif`'s XML output format. Specifically, a missing check for an empty string in the `escape_xml` function could result in a null pointer dereference when processing crafted JPEG EXIF data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a null pointer dereference. This occurs when the `escape_xml` function is called with a null or empty string which then is used without a proper check.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit results in a denial of service. The null pointer dereference causes the program to crash, thus making it unavailable for legitimate users.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted JPEG image:** The attack vector is a specially crafted JPEG image containing malicious EXIF data that triggers the vulnerable code path in `exif`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious JPEG image to a system using the affected `exif` package. This can be achieved through various means, including uploading the file to a web server, emailing it, or having an application that processes user-provided images.

**Additional Details**
* The fix for this vulnerability involves adding a check for empty strings before proceeding with the processing of the string by the function. The fix was introduced in commit `f6334d9d32437ef13dc902f0a88a2be0063d9d1c` of the libexif/exif repository, which added a check `if (!strlen(text)) return "empty string";`. Commit `eb84b0e3c5f2a86013b6fcfb800d187896a648fa` then changed the return value to `""` and a later pull request, PR #12, further improves it.
* The vulnerability is considered remotely exploitable and is of "low" severity according to Gentoo.
* Patched versions of `exif` are `0.6.22` or greater.
* Several distributions, including Fedora, have released updates to address the vulnerability.
