{
  "CVE-2021-27097": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `fdt_find_regions()` function in U-Boot's FIT (Flattened Image Tree) parsing logic did not properly validate the structure of the FIT, specifically it did not check for multiple root nodes or root nodes with names, which are invalid.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of validation of the FIT structure, allowing a crafted FIT with multiple root nodes or a root node with a name to bypass checks.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A malformed FIT could potentially cause unexpected behavior or allow for further exploitation, though the specific impact isn't detailed, the severity is rated as high.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker could craft a malformed FIT image containing multiple root nodes or a root node with a name, which when loaded by U-Boot would expose the vulnerability.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to provide the malformed FIT image to the U-Boot bootloader."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The U-Boot bootloader did not perform a full check of the FIT (Flattened Image Tree) structure, allowing for crafted FITs to bypass validation checks.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability stems from the bootloader's incomplete FIT validation, which fails to detect and reject malformed FITs that could lead to unpredictable behavior.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can supply a specially crafted FIT image which is mishandled by the boot loader.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker could provide a specially crafted FIT image during the boot process, which if not correctly validated could cause issues.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need the capability to load a custom FIT image during the boot process. "
