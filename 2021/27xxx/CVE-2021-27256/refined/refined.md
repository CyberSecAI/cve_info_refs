Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-27256:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is located in the `apply_save.cgi` script of the NETGEAR R7800 router.
* It arises from the lack of proper validation of the `rc_service` parameter before it is used in a system call.
* The `rc_service` parameter is user-supplied and is not sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. By injecting malicious commands into the `rc_service` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the device.
* **Insufficient Input Validation:** The lack of proper input validation is the root cause, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
* **Authentication Bypass (mentioned):** Although the advisory states that authentication is required, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution on the affected NETGEAR R7800 router.
* **Root Access:** The code is executed in the context of the root user, granting the attacker full control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Network-Adjacent:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be network-adjacent to the vulnerable router.
* **Ability to Manipulate HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the `apply_save.cgi` script.
* **Authentication Bypass (mentioned):** The attacker must be able to bypass authentication.
