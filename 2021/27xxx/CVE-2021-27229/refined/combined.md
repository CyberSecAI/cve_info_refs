Our public server list registration script doesn't have an URL scheme
whitelist for the website field.

Turns out a malicious server can register itself with a dangerous URL in

right-clicking on the server entry and clicking on "Open Webpage".

This commit introduces a client-side whitelist, which only allows "http"
and "https" schemes. We will also implement it in our public list.

In future we should probably add a warning QMessageBox informing the
user that there's no guarantee the URL is safe (regardless of the
scheme).

Thanks a lot to <https://positive.security> for reporting the RCE
vulnerability to us privately.

`[FIX(client): Only allow "http"/"https" for URLs in ConnectDialog](/mumble-voip/mumble/pull/4733/commits/fe7d212b95490c5b6cb20d91543c92b88d7aeb8e "FIX(client): Only allow \"http\"/\"https\" for URLs in ConnectDialog

Our public server list registration script doesn't have an URL scheme
whitelist for the website field.

Turns out a malicious server can register itself with a dangerous URL in
an attempt to attack a user's machine.

User interaction is required, as the URL has to be opened by
right-clicking on the server entry and clicking on \"Open Webpage\".

This commit introduces a client-side whitelist, which only allows \"http\"
and \"https\" schemes. We will also implement it in our public list.

In future we should probably add a warning QMessageBox informing the
user that there's no guarantee the URL is safe (regardless of the
scheme).

Thanks a lot to https://positive.security for reporting the RCE
vulnerability to us privately.")`

   For some reason qFatal has been used to log information such as the

    …

   ```
   Our public server list registration script doesn't have an URL scheme
   whitelist for the website field.

   Turns out a malicious server can register itself with a dangerous URL in
   an attempt to attack a user's machine.

   User interaction is required, as the URL has to be opened by
   right-clicking on the server entry and clicking on "Open Webpage".

   This commit introduces a client-side whitelist, which only allows "http"
   and "https" schemes. We will also implement it in our public list.

   In future we should probably add a warning QMessageBox informing the
   user that there's no guarantee the URL is safe (regardless of the
   scheme).

   Thanks a lot to <https://positive.security> for reporting the RCE
   vulnerability to us privately.

7. [FIX(ocb2): Work around packet loss due to OCB2 XEX\* mitigation](/mumble-voip/mumble/commit/c1ceb5968c9609adccc30dec1ca57b20a4087cb9)
    …

   ```
   The mitigation for vulnerabilities discovered in
   OCB2 (<https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/311>, called XEX* attack, or XEXStarAttack, in code)
   introduced in [be97594](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/commit/be975940461c840d071b89277475acbd49ef604a) ([#4227](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/pull/4227)) willingly allowed for some packets with specific
   characteristics to be dropped during encryption to prevent the vulnerability
   from being exploited.
   It was assumed that the chance of such packets was sufficiently small (given
   we are dealing with compressed audio) that such loss was acceptable.

   It was however discovered that digital silence (as produced by e.g. a noise
   gate) will cause Opus to emit almost exclusively such packets, leading to strong
   artifacts on the receiving end. See [#4385](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/issues/4385).

   This commit tries to work around the issue by modifying such packets in a way
   which will no longer require them to be dropped, and yet produce the expected
   output on the receiver side.
   As far as I understand [Opus] (specifically section 4.1, 4.3.0 and 4.3.3), the
   0s are simply unused bits and are only there because we running Opus in constant
   bitrate mode. So, flipping one of them should have no effect on the resulting
   audio.

   [Opus]: <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6716>

   Fixes [#4719](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/issues/4719)
