  "response": {
    "CVE-2021-27198": {
      "status": "RELEVANT",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation and sanitization of the file path provided by the user during file upload, allowing an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the server due to insufficient checks on the file path.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Unrestricted file upload vulnerability",
          "Path traversal vulnerability",
          "Improper input validation",
          "Use of `Path.Combine` with user-controlled input",
          "Insecure file handling",
          "Improper encoding/decoding of byte data",
            "Usage of hardcoded crypto keys for verification"
        ],
        "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected server with SYSTEM privileges on Windows and root on Linux. This can lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service, and other malicious activities.",
        "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the /myspeed/sf endpoint or via a websocket with manipulated  `restoreSqlData` operation, including a malicious file path in a multipart request, causing the server to write to arbitrary locations",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any authentication credentials to exploit this vulnerability. They only require network access to the affected server. For successful exploitation, an attacker needs to control the response from the update server."
