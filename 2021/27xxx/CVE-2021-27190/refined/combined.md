## Software

Peel Shopping 9.4.0

## Vulnerability

Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in the "Address" field of "<http://localhost/peelshopping_9_4_0/utilisateurs/change_params.php>"

## Affects

Peel Shopping 9.4.0

### Tested on Linux, Apache httpd

## Description

A Stored Cross Site Scripting attack occurs when a malicious script is injected directly into a vulnerable web application. Every time the infected page is viewed, the malicious script is transmitted to the victim’s browser.

In Peel Shopping 9.4.0, a user supplied polyglot payload in the "Address" field of the "Change my credentials" form (change\_params.php) is echoed back in javascript code in HTML response. This allows an attacker to input malicious JavaScript which can steal cookie, redirect them to other malicious website, etc.

## Proof of Concept

1. Log in to your account
2. Navigate to the "Change my credentials" page (<http://localhost/peel_9_4_0/utilisateurs/change_params.php>)
3. Paste the payload in the "Address" field

`jaVasCript:/*-/*`/*\`/*'/*"/**/(/* */oNcliCk=alert() )//%0D%0A%0d%0a//</stYle/</titLe/</teXtarEa/</scRipt/--!>\x3csVg/<sVg/oNloAd=alert()//>\x3e`

4. Click on "Change"
5. You will now get an alert box indicating that the malicious script has executed.

| [CVE-2021-27190](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-27190) updatedVulnerability Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in the "Address" field of "<http://localhost/peelshopping_9_4_0/utilisateurs/change_params.php>" Affects Peel Shopping 9.4.0 Description A Stored Cross Site Scripting attack occurs when a malicious script is injected directly into a vulnerable web application. Every time the infected page is viewed, the malicious script is transmitted to the victim’s browser.  In Peel Shopping 9.4.0, a user supplied polyglot payload in the "Address" field of the "Change my credentials" form (change\_params.php) is echoed back in javascript code in HTML response. This allows an attacker to input malicious JavaScript which can steal cookie, redirect them to other malicious website, etc. Proof of Concept  1. Log in to your account 2. Navigate to the "Change my credentials" page (<http://localhost/peel_9_4_0/utilisateurs/change_params.php>) 3. Paste the below payload in the "Address" field  ``` jaVasCript:/*-/*`/*\`/*'/*"/**/(/* */oNcliCk=alert() )//%0D%0A%0d%0a//</stYle/</titLe/</teXtarEa/</scRipt/--!>\x3csVg/<sVg/oNloAd=alert()//>\x3e  ```  4. Click on "Change" 5. You will now get an alert box indicating that the malicious script has executed.  References You can refer to this repository for reference: <https://github.com/vulf/Peel-Shopping-cart-9.4.0-Stored-XSS> You can find the Proof of Concept video at <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cngTLXe3Nf2tHozcYmvnxFRbK6_VWHkL/view?usp=sharing> References for Mitigation Vulnerability [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS\_(Cross\_Site\_Scripting)\_Prevention\_Cheat\_Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_%28Cross_Site_Scripting%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet) |

| Fix I believe you can fix this issue by using the `str_form_value` filter in the Smarty/Twig template file, `user_change_params_form.tpl`, like so  ``` @@ -146,7 +146,7 @@  {/if}         <div class="enregistrement">                 <span class="enregistrementgauche"><label for="adresse">{$STR_ADDRESS}{if !empty($mandatory.adresse)} <span class="etoile">*</span>{/if}{$STR_BEFORE_TWO_POINTS}:</label></span> -               <span class="enregistrementdroite"><input class="form-control" name="adresse" id="adresse" value="{$adresse|html_entity_decode_if_needed}" {$content_rows_info} /></span>{$adresse_error} +               <span class="enregistrementdroite"><input class="form-control" name="adresse" id="adresse" value="{$adresse|html_entity_decode_if_needed|str_form_value}" {$content_rows_info} /></span>{$adresse_error}         </div>         {foreach $specific_fields as $f}                 {if $f.field_position=='adresse'}  ``` |

It was our company’s first attempt to step into Digital Security with Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing – VAPT Methodoly. It seemed like we get into the right hands. It was more cost-effective, intuitive and valuable outcomes, than the others we looked at. It was the right fit. Thanks Secuneus

# CVE-2021-27190 – PEEL SHOPPING

![](https://www.secuneus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/homepage.png)
**CVE ID**: CVE-2021-27190

**Vulnerability Nam**e: Stored Cross Site Scripting(XSS)

**Product**: Peel Shopping

**Affected Version**: 9.3.0

**Credits**: Anmol K Sachan
###### Vendor Homepage :

<https://www.peel.fr/>

###### Software Link

<https://www.peel.fr/nos-offres-1/peel-shopping-31.html>

<https://sourceforge.net/projects/peel-shopping/>

###### Vulnerable Software Link

<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dIwRdaqtEyqUUgxbRqrHiS5WQ10nEG8z/view?usp=sharing>

##### Software: :

PEEL SHOPPING 9.3.0

##### Vulnerability Type:

Stored Cross-site Scripting

##### Vulnerability

Stored XSS

###### Tested on Windows 10 XAMPP

###### CVE Assigned

CVE-2021-27190

This application is vulnerable to Stored XSS vulnerability.

###### Vulnerable script

<http://localhost/peel-shopping_9_3_0/utilisateurs/change_params.php>

##### Vulnerable parameters

‘Address’

##### Payload used

`jaVasCript:/*-/*`/*\`/*'/*"/**/(/* */oNcliCk=alert() )//%0D%0A%0d%0a//</stYle/</titLe/</teXtarEa/</scRipt/--!>\x3csVg/<sVg/oNloAd=alert()//>\x3e`

##### POC

<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t1hksDsYqYsqryRq61tNIQQMTCFidtc1/view>

In the same page where we injected payload click on the text box to edit the address.

You will see your Javascript code (XSS) executed.

##### CVE Assigned

CVE-2021-27190

This application is vulnerable to Stored XSS vulnerability.

##### Current Description

A Stored Cross Site Scripting(XSS) Vulnerability was discovered in PEEL SHOPPING 9.3.0 which is publically available. The user supplied input containing polyglot payload is echoed back in javascript code in HTML response. This allows an attacker to input malicious JavaScript which can steal cookie, redirect them to other malicious website, etc.

##### Impact

In Stored Cross Site Scripting, the malicious JavaScript payload is saved in database and is reflected back once the vulnerable web page is opened and it will always be triggered if the page is opened every time as it is saved in database.

Stored XSS, also known as persistent XSS, is the more damaging than non-persistent XSS. It occurs when a malicious script is injected directly into a vulnerable web application.

##### Remediation, Solution

* Escape all user Input and Output .
* Escape All Special Characters .
* Internet Explorer has an Attribute HTTP-Only that can be set for the cookies to prevent stealing of of cookies and avoids access to cookies by any script . This is Output Validation instead of input Validation .
* Escape all untrusted data based on the Body ,  Attribute , Javascript , CSS and URL .
* White-List input validation is an excellent strategy for the prevention of XSS . Here we define a list of Allowed input by the user . Any input which is not as per the allowed white-list (which is just the allowed regular expressions) is not taken as an input and simply rejected .
* Use of OWASP Auto-Sanitization library is highly recommended .
* To prevent XSS also use Anti-Sammy or Java HTML Sanitizer Project (also from OWASP)
* Use OWASP Content Security Policy .
* Output Validation is a must thing . Otherwise without proper escaping or validation it will be treated as an active content by the browser.
* Build a good XSS Filter .

##### Building A Good XSS Filter

Keep in mind that no perfect XSS Filter can be made . XSS filter is just an added layer of protection . XSS filter will help to make our Application protected from vague attacks and script kiddies .

**Basic Rules For XSS Filter**

* Encode every data given by the user .
* If the data is not via user and arrives by a GET request , encode this data too .
* The Following data must be properly sanitized .
  1. URL
  2. HTTP Referrer Objects : HTTP Header Field that defines the address of the webpage associated with the resource requested .
  3. GET Parameters from a Form .
  4. POST Parameters from a Form .
  5. Windows.location : Javascript Object that can be used to get the address of the current webpage and also can be used to redirect to another web page .
  6. Doccument.Referrer : Returns the URL of the Document that loaded the current document .
  7. Document.Location : Contains the information about the current URL .
  8. Document.URL
  9. Document.URLENCODED
  10. Cookie Data
  11. All Headers Data
  12. DATABASE Data
