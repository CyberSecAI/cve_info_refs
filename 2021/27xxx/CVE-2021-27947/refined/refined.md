- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of forum data fetched from the database within the Admin Control Panel's *Copy Forum* feature in Forum Management. This unsanitized data is then used in subsequent SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or complete compromise of the database. This is a high impact, as indicated by the CVSS score (Confidentiality: High, Integrity: High, Availability: High).
- **Attack vectors:** Network. An attacker would need to send malicious input through the application to trigger the SQL injection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs high privileges, specifically access to the Admin Control Panel, to exploit this vulnerability. User interaction is not required.
