- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper filtering of IPv6 SSH connections.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate filtering of IPv6 connections, specifically SSH, leading to a firewall bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass the firewall. Additionally, this vulnerability can be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited via network connections, specifically through IPv6.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
