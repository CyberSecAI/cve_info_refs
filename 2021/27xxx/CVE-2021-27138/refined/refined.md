Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27138:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in how the U-Boot bootloader handles node names with unit addresses (e.g., `node@1`) within Flattened Image Trees (FITs). The `libfdt` library, used by U-Boot, ignores unit addresses when matching nodes. This means that if a FIT contains a node named `fred` and another node named `fred@1`, `libfdt` would consider them the same when searching for a node named `fred`. This behavior can be exploited if signature verification is enabled, as the verification process might not check the correct node.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Inconsistent Node Matching:** The core weakness is the inconsistency between how node names are interpreted during FIT parsing by `libfdt` and how they are intended to be used in the FIT structure. This can lead to incorrect node selection during signature verification if an attacker adds a node with an "@" at the end.
-   **Bypass of Signature Verification:** When a FIT uses node names with unit addresses, a malicious actor can potentially bypass signature verification by creating a crafted FIT image with a node that has the same base name as a signed node but with a different unit address, causing the system to match the incorrect node

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Boot Process Manipulation:** By crafting a FIT with malicious nodes using unit addresses, an attacker can potentially manipulate the boot process of systems using U-Boot to load unsigned code or modify boot parameters.
-   **Security Bypass:** The vulnerability can allow a bypass of the FIT signature verification by substituting a different node with the same base name as a signed node. This could enable execution of unauthorized code

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Crafted FIT Image:** An attacker needs to create a specially crafted FIT image that includes nodes with unit addresses (e.g., `node@1`).
-   **FIT Image Replacement:** This crafted FIT image would need to be introduced to the target system, replacing or supplementing a valid FIT.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Modify FIT:** The attacker must be able to modify or supply the FIT image used by the U-Boot bootloader.
-   **Access to Target System:** The attacker needs physical or logical access to the system to overwrite the existing FIT image or to introduce a malicious FIT.
-   **Understanding of FIT Structure:** The attacker must possess a solid understanding of the FIT structure to craft a malicious image that exploits the vulnerability effectively.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The fix for this CVE involves adding checks to disallow the use of unit addresses in FIT nodes in U-Boot and to update related tests.
-   The provided content also mentions CVE-2021-27097, which is related to general FIT mishandling.
-   The fix was implemented by commits [3f04db8](https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot/commit/3f04db891a353f4b127ed57279279f851c6b4917), [79af75f](https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot/commit/79af75f7776fc20b0d7eb6afe1e27c00fdb4b9b4), and [b6f4c75](https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot/commit/b6f4c757959f8850e1299a77c8e5713da78e8ec0).

In summary, CVE-2021-27138 highlights a critical vulnerability in U-Boot's FIT handling that, if exploited, can lead to unauthorized code execution by bypassing signature verification, by adding a node with the @ symbol in its name.
