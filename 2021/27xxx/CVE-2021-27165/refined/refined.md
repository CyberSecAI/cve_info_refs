The provided content contains detailed information about multiple vulnerabilities found in FiberHome HG6245D routers, including CVE-2021-27165.

**CVE-2021-27165 Details:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The telnet CLI server uses hardcoded credentials.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   Hardcoded credentials for telnet access on port 23/tcp.
    *   Specifically, the username `gpon` and password `gpon` can be used to log in to the telnet CLI.
*   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *   Successful login grants access to the router's command-line interface, allowing for further exploitation.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   Network access to the telnet port (23/tcp).
    *   This can be achieved through the LAN or WAN (via IPv6 due to lack of IPv6 firewall rules), once firewall rules are bypassed via other vulnerabilities.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   An attacker must have network connectivity to the telnet port of the device.

**Additional Information:**

*   The content identifies other related CVEs, including CVE-2021-27166, CVE-2021-27167, CVE-2021-27168, and CVE-2021-27169, all stemming from the same root cause of hardcoded credentials in the telnet CLI.
*   It is possible to use a telnet CLI authentication bypass (CVE-2021-27177) in conjunction with the hardcoded credentials to achieve code execution and a root shell.
*   The content also shows how to enable the telnet server via a backdoor on the web server, as well as information leaks that would expose the required information for the telnet backdoor.
