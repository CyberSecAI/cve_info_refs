```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The device's web interface has several hardcoded credentials that can be used for login",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Hardcoded credentials for multiple users and ISPs are stored in the device's firmware. These credentials can be used to access the web interface (`https://ip/fh`) which opens access to a CLI telnet server on port 23/tcp.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the device's CLI telnet interface and perform privileged operations.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by using the hardcoded credentials on the web interface to gain access to the CLI telnet server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the device's web interface and knowledge of the hardcoded credentials."
