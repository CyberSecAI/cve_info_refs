The provided content relates to CVE-2021-27168.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from hardcoded credentials within the CLI telnet server, specifically the credentials `gpon/gpon` and the `enable: gpon` command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hardcoded credentials for the CLI telnet server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain access to the CLI telnet server using the hardcoded credentials, enabling them to perform privileged operations, including starting a Linux telnetd with root privileges. This can lead to full control of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access to the device via TCP port 23/telnet.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to be able to connect to the telnet service on the device. This could be over the LAN, or over the WAN if IPv6 is enabled due to the lack of firewall on IPv6 connections, or through a separate exploit that opens up the telnet service via the backdoor HTTP API.
- Attacker needs to know the hardcoded credentials (`gpon/gpon`).
