{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when setting the 'width' parameter for page elements.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users accessing the affected page. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or the execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser context.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the 'other pages width' field via a crafted HTTP request, which then gets stored in the application's database. When a user views the page, the stored XSS payload is executed.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs administrative access to the Dolphin CMS in order to modify page settings via the 'Builders' => 'Pages Builder' section of the admin panel. The attacker must have the ability to intercept HTTP requests using a tool like Burp Suite."
