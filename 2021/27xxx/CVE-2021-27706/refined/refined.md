  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in the `formIPMacBindDel` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Unvalidated input"
     ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code by sending a crafted GET request.",
    "attack_vector": "A crafted GET request is sent to the affected router.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a GET request to the router and craft the `IPMacBindIndex` parameter with a long string.",

        "Tenda G1 router",

    "poc": "The Proof of Concept (PoC) is to set the value of the `IPMacBindIndex` parameter to a long string, like 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...', which causes a buffer overflow when copied using `strcpy`."
