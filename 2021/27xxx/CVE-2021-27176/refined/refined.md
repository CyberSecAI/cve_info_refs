Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-27176:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Description:** Credentials stored in clear text files. Specifically, the Wi-Fi configurations, including SSIDs and passwords (PSK, WEP keys, Radius keys), are stored in cleartext in configuration files within the `/fhconf/fh_wifi/` directory.
*   **Root cause:**  The system is storing sensitive information without proper encryption or obfuscation in world-readable files on the file system.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of encryption for sensitive data at rest.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who gains access to the device's file system (e.g., via other vulnerabilities or by local access) can easily retrieve Wi-Fi credentials.
*   **Attack vectors:**  File system access through other vulnerabilities like RCE or physical access to the device.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have some form of access to the device's filesystem (e.g., through exploiting other vulnerabilities or physical access).
