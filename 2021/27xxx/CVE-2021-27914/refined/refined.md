- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Mautic installer does not sufficiently sanitize user input, leading to a potential vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization during the installation process.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts during the install process, leading to a compromised Mautic installation with high impact to confidentiality, integrity and availability of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based and requires access to the Mautic installation process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs high privileges and must have access to the install process, requiring user interaction (to trigger the install process).
