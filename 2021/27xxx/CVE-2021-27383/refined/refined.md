Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2021-27383:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap allocation leak in the SmartVNC server's Tight encoder.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Heap allocation leak: Resources are allocated without being properly released leading to a memory leak.
- Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119): Although the specific nature of how the heap allocation leak occurs isn't detailed, it's classified under the broader CWE-119 category.
- Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (CWE-770): The vulnerability is also classified as CWE-770, indicating that resource allocation is not properly managed or limited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial-of-Service (DoS): The heap allocation leak can lead to excessive memory consumption, eventually causing the affected system to become unresponsive or crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require any authentication or user interaction (PR:N, UI:N). They can remotely send specially crafted data to the affected server.

**Summary of CVE-2021-27383:**
The vulnerability is a heap allocation leak in the SmartVNC server's Tight encoder. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send specially crafted data to the server, causing it to continuously allocate memory without releasing it, leading to a denial-of-service.
