**Root Cause:** The software does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. This is categorized as a "Protection Mechanism Failure."

**Vulnerability:** Improper or missing protection mechanism.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information (confidentiality) and potential modification of data (integrity), but no impact on system availability.

**Attack Vector:** Network-based attack (AV:N) with a high attack complexity (AC:H)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require privileges or user interaction (PR:N/UI:N). However, the attacker needs to overcome the high attack complexity (AC:H) to be able to exploit this vulnerability.
