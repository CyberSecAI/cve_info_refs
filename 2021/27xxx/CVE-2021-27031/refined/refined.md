Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-27031:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error.
- It occurs due to a lack of validation of an object's existence before performing operations on it during the parsing of FBX and DAE files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free: The application attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can leverage the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected process.
- **Denial of Service:** A malicious file can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File:** An attacker crafts a malicious FBX or DAE file.
- **User Interaction:** The target user must open this malicious file using the vulnerable Autodesk FBX Review software. Alternatively, the user might be tricked into visiting a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to craft a malicious FBX or DAE file:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create a specially crafted file to trigger the use-after-free condition.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious file or visit a malicious web page.
