Based on the provided content, CVE-2021-27153 relates to hardcoded credentials present in the HTTP server of FiberHome HG6245D routers.

**Root Cause:** The web daemon contains a list of hardcoded credentials for different ISPs. These credentials allow access to the CLI telnet server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Hardcoded credentials present in the `webs` binary (HTTP Server).
- Multiple sets of credentials for various ISPs and purposes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful authentication using these credentials will provide access to the CLI telnet on port 23/tcp.
- This could lead to further exploitation of the system if additional vulnerabilities are exploited from the CLI telnet access.
- This also serves as an entry point for further exploitation of other vulnerabilities in the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote access via the web interface (`https://<router_ip>/fh`).
- Exploitation can occur over both IPv4 and IPv6.
- An attacker can use these credentials to bypass authentication and gain access to the CLI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the router's web interface (either LAN or WAN via IPv6).
- No prior authentication is required to attempt the hardcoded credentials.
- Knowledge of the hardcoded credentials.
