| Description RIOT's RPL implementation as provided by the `gnrc_rpl` module lacks proper bounds checks. RPL messages are encapsulated in ICMPv6 datagrams. The message body of the ICMPv6 datagram is extracted as follows:     [RIOT/sys/net/gnrc/routing/rpl/gnrc\_rpl.c](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/7ed50c3d18492ba4875b6adf3b7f51b48e4a7f21/sys/net/gnrc/routing/rpl/gnrc_rpl.c#L175-L196)  Lines 175 to 196 in [7ed50c3](/RIOT-OS/RIOT/commit/7ed50c3d18492ba4875b6adf3b7f51b48e4a7f21)   |  | icmpv6\_hdr = (icmpv6\_hdr\_t \*)icmpv6->data; | | --- | --- | |  | switch (icmpv6\_hdr->code) { | |  | case GNRC\_RPL\_ICMPV6\_CODE\_DIS: | |  | DEBUG("RPL: DIS received\n"); | |  | gnrc\_rpl\_recv\_DIS((gnrc\_rpl\_dis\_t \*)(icmpv6\_hdr + 1), iface, &ipv6\_hdr->src, | |  | &ipv6\_hdr->dst, byteorder\_ntohs(ipv6\_hdr->len)); | |  | break; | |  | case GNRC\_RPL\_ICMPV6\_CODE\_DIO: | |  | DEBUG("RPL: DIO received\n"); | |  | gnrc\_rpl\_recv\_DIO((gnrc\_rpl\_dio\_t \*)(icmpv6\_hdr + 1), iface, &ipv6\_hdr->src, | |  | &ipv6\_hdr->dst, byteorder\_ntohs(ipv6\_hdr->len)); | |  | break; | |  | case GNRC\_RPL\_ICMPV6\_CODE\_DAO: | |  | DEBUG("RPL: DAO received\n"); | |  | gnrc\_rpl\_recv\_DAO((gnrc\_rpl\_dao\_t \*)(icmpv6\_hdr + 1), iface, &ipv6\_hdr->src, | |  | &ipv6\_hdr->dst, byteorder\_ntohs(ipv6\_hdr->len)); | |  | break; | |  | case GNRC\_RPL\_ICMPV6\_CODE\_DAO\_ACK: | |  | DEBUG("RPL: DAO-ACK received\n"); | |  | gnrc\_rpl\_recv\_DAO\_ACK((gnrc\_rpl\_dao\_ack\_t \*)(icmpv6\_hdr + 1), iface, &ipv6\_hdr->src, | |  | &ipv6\_hdr->dst, byteorder\_ntohs(ipv6\_hdr->len)); | |  | break; |      The code above casts `icmpv6_hdr + 1` (i.e. the ICMPv6 message body) to the appropriate RPL packed struct (e.g. `gnrc_rpl_dio_t`). However, it does not check whether the message is large enough to even contain a `gnrc_rpl_dio_t` (or any other packed RPL struct). As such, the handlers in `gnrc_rpl_control_messages.c` for specific RPL messages must check the `len` parameter before accessing any fields of these structs. The handler for `gnrc_rpl_dao_t` messages, for example, directly pass the required information to the `gnrc_rpl_validation_DAO` function, however, this function itself access fields of the struct before performing a length check to ensure that these fields are actually present. For example:     [RIOT/sys/net/gnrc/routing/rpl/gnrc\_rpl\_control\_messages.c](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/1b35d06a51a8a77c88e489e1571a201a68f8d400/sys/net/gnrc/routing/rpl/gnrc_rpl_control_messages.c#L116-L118)  Lines 116 to 118 in [1b35d06](/RIOT-OS/RIOT/commit/1b35d06a51a8a77c88e489e1571a201a68f8d400)   |  | if ((dao->k\_d\_flags & GNRC\_RPL\_DAO\_D\_BIT)) { | | --- | --- | |  | expected\_len += sizeof(ipv6\_addr\_t); | |  | } |      If the ICMP packet is too short this will result in an out-of-bounds read. Steps to reproduce the issue Use `examples/gnrc_networking`, activate `gnrc_pktbuf_malloc` and set `CONFIG_GNRC_RPL_DEFAULT_NETIF` to your netif (check with `ifconfig` in the shell provided by `gnrc_networking`) mine is `6`:  ``` diff --git a/examples/gnrc_networking/Makefile b/examples/gnrc_networking/Makefile index bf76931305..15132894c1 100644 --- a/examples/gnrc_networking/Makefile +++ b/examples/gnrc_networking/Makefile @@ -31,6 +31,9 @@ USEMODULE += netstats_l2  USEMODULE += netstats_ipv6  USEMODULE += netstats_rpl   +USEMODULE += gnrc_pktbuf_malloc +CFLAGS += -DCONFIG_GNRC_RPL_DEFAULT_NETIF=6 +  # Optionally include DNS support.
