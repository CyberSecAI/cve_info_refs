Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27962:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A mechanism introduced in Grafana Enterprise 7.2.0 allows users with the "Editor" role to bypass data source permissions on an organization's default data source, if configured. This means an editor can manipulate dashboards to expose data from a restricted data source they shouldn't have access to, through alerts and notification channels.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect access control:** The vulnerability lies in the flawed permission checks related to the organization's default data source.
- **Privilege escalation:** Users with the "Editor" role, which should have limited permissions, can escalate their privileges and gain access to sensitive data.
- **Data exposure:** Attackers can leverage the vulnerability to expose restricted data through dashboard manipulation and notification channels.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized data access:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive data from restricted data sources that they are not authorized to view, potentially leading to data breaches or leaks.
- **Information disclosure:**  By manipulating dashboards and alerts, attackers can expose data to unauthorized notification channels.
- **Compromise of data confidentiality:** Sensitive data can be exposed, violating the confidentiality principle of security.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Dashboard manipulation:** Attackers can craft malicious dashboards with alerts configured to expose data from the restricted default data source.
- **Alerting mechanism:** Attackers utilize the alerting system to push data out to notification channels.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Grafana Enterprise user with "Editor" role:**  The attacker must have a valid Grafana Enterprise account with the "Editor" role within an organization.
- **Default data source configured:** The organization must have a default data source configured in Grafana.
- **Alerting enabled:** Alerting feature must be enabled in the Grafana instance.
- **No direct access to the default data source:** The "Editor" user should not have explicit permissions to query the default data source directly.

**Additional Details (beyond official CVE description):**

- The vulnerability affects Grafana Enterprise versions 7.2.0 to 7.4.3.
- The vulnerability is considered to be of high severity.
- The content highlights the fact that there is no mitigation, and upgrading to a patched version is the only solution.
- The provided text explains how the exploit works: An editor user with no access to a data source manipulates a dashboard with alerts in a way that will expose the data from that restricted data source to any notification channel configured for alerts.
