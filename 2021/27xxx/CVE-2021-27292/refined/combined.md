|  | Doyensec Vulnerability Advisory |
| --- | --- |
|  | CVE-2021-27292 |
|  | ======================================================================= |
|  | \* Regular Expression Denial of Service (REDoS) in ua-parser-js |
|  | \* Affected Product: ua-parser-js >= 0.7.14, fixed in 0.7.24 |
|  | \* Vendor: https://github.com/faisalman |
|  | \* Severity: Medium |
|  | \* Vulnerability Class: Denial of Service |
|  | \* Status: Fixed |
|  | \* Author(s): Ben Caller (Doyensec) |
|  | ======================================================================= |
|  |  |
|  | === SUMMARY === |
|  |  |
|  | The npm package ua-parser-js uses a regular expression which is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (REDoS). |
|  | If an attacker provides a malicious User-Agent header, ua-parser-js can get stuck processing for a long time. |
|  |  |
|  | === TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION === |
|  |  |
|  | The vulnerable regular expression is found in src/ua-parser.js on line 620 (version 0.7.23): |
|  |  |
|  | /android.+[;\/]\s+(Barnes[&\s]+Noble\s+|BN[RT])(V?.\*)\s+build/ |
|  |  |
|  | The section (Barnes[&\s]+Noble\s+|BN[RT])(V?.\*)\s+ can be simplified as |
|  |  |
|  | Noble\s+(.\*)\s+ |
|  |  |
|  | showing that it contains three infinitely repeating groups which all match space character. A long string of spaces can cause catastrophic backtracking. |
|  | The complexity is cubic, so doubling the length of the malicious string of spaces makes processing take 8 times as long. |
|  |  |
|  | When used on a server, the payload will be constrained by the server's maximum header length. |
|  |  |
|  | === REPRODUCTION STEPS === |
|  |  |
|  | require('ua-parser-js')('android0/ Barnes&Noble' + ' '.repeat(5432) + '!') |
|  |  |
|  | To attack a server, set the User-Agent header to 'android0/ Barnes&Noble !' but with more spaces. |
|  |  |
|  | Doubling the length of the string of spaces will make processing take 8 times as long. |
|  |  |
|  | === REMEDIATION === |
|  |  |
|  | Fix the vulnerable regular expression. |
|  |  |
|  | A potential fix is to replace (V?.\*) with (\S.\*\S) or (\S(?:.\*\S)?), so that a long string of spaces does not match multiple groups. |
|  |  |
|  | === DISCLOSURE TIMELINE === |
