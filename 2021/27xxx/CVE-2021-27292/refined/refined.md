{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a regular expression in `ua-parser-js` that is susceptible to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The regex contains multiple repeating groups with space character matches, leading to catastrophic backtracking when processing a long string of spaces.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a malicious User-Agent header with a long string of spaces, leading `ua-parser-js` to become stuck processing for an extended period.",
     "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is a malicious User-Agent header containing a long string of spaces. This can be sent through HTTP requests to a server using `ua-parser-js`.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a custom User-Agent header to a server utilizing the vulnerable version of `ua-parser-js`."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    {
      "product": "ua-parser-js",
      "version": ">= 0.7.14 and < 0.7.24"
    }
  ],
  "fix_versions": [
    "0.7.24"
  ],
  "additional_info": "The vulnerable regular expression is located in `src/ua-parser.js` at line 620 (version 0.7.23). The fix involves replacing `(V?.*)` with `(\\S(?:.\\*\\S)?)` or `(\\S.\\*\\S)` to prevent long strings of spaces from matching multiple groups. The vulnerability has been assigned a severity of 'Medium'. The provided reproduction step involves passing a crafted user-agent string to the `ua-parser-js` function. Doubling the length of the string of spaces will increase the processing time by 8 times, indicating the cubic complexity."
