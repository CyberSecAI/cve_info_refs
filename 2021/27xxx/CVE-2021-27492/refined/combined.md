individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-27488

Affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing of CATPart ﬁles. This
could result in an out of bounds write past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker could leverage
this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process (ZDI-CAN-11950).
