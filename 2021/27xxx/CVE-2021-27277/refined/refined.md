Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Deserialization of untrusted data within the OneTimeJobSchedulerEventsService WCF service in SolarWinds Orion Virtual Infrastructure Monitor. This occurs due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The application deserializes untrusted data without proper validation, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** User-supplied data is not properly sanitized or validated before being processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can escalate privileges from a low-privileged account to SYSTEM level access.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the SYSTEM user, allowing for complete control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target system.
*   **WCF Service:** The vulnerability is present in the OneTimeJobSchedulerEventsService WCF service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low-Privilege Access:** The attacker must initially have low-privileged code execution on the target machine.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was reported to SolarWinds on 2020-11-13 and a fix was released by 2021-03-30.
* The vulnerability affects SolarWinds Orion Virtual Infrastructure Monitor.
