Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27221:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `/export` command in MikroTik RouterOS not properly checking for the `write` policy when using the `file` parameter. This allows users with only the `ftp` policy to write arbitrary `.rsc` files to the filesystem, even if they lack the `write` policy which is intended to control filesystem write access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Privilege Check:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper permission checks for the `/export file=<filename>` command. Specifically, the command bypasses the expected requirement for the `write` policy.
- **Inconsistent Behavior:**  Other file write operations via SCP, WebFig, etc., correctly enforce the `write` policy, making this inconsistency a vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** Attackers can overwrite existing `.rsc` files on the RouterOS device.
- **File System Exhaustion:** Attackers can repeatedly call `/export file=<random>` in a loop to create numerous files, potentially filling up the filesystem and causing a denial of service.
- **Potential RouterOS Instability/Crash:** Filling the filesystem could lead to instability or even a crash of the RouterOS system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Command Injection:** The vulnerability is exploited via the RouterOS console, by using the command `/export file=<filename>`.
- **Network Access:** Attackers can leverage any available access method where console commands can be issued if they have the `ftp` policy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **User Account:** The attacker needs a user account on the RouterOS device.
- **`ftp` Policy:** The user account must have the `ftp` policy enabled. The `read` or `write` policy is not required.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the RouterOS device to be able to issue commands.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is present in RouterOS versions 6.47.9 and 6.48.1.
- Mikrotik initially classified this as a "feature" but later fixed it in 6.49beta22.
- The fix implemented in version 6.49beta22 requires the “write+ftp” permissions for executing script to file, exporting configuration to file, and printing to file.
