Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-27795:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from cryptographic issues in the license string format used by Brocade Fabric OS (FOS) on certain hardware platforms. This allows for the creation and installation of forged or fraudulent license keys that the Brocade Fabric OS platform will authenticate and activate as if they were legitimate.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Weak Cryptography:** The license string format relies on a flawed cryptographic implementation, which permits the creation of counterfeit license keys.
*   **Insufficient Validation:** The Brocade Fabric OS software does not adequately validate the license keys, leading to the acceptance of fraudulent ones.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to various detrimental impacts, including:

*   **Unauthorized Software Versions:** Installation of FOS versions not authorized for the switch, potentially leading to misconfiguration of hardware, system issues, data corruption, and privilege escalation.
*   **Information Exposure:** Exposure of sensitive information on the switch, including user profile details.
*   **Unsupported Features:** Enabling unsupported or illegitimate feature combinations, which can harm fabric operations and disrupt end-device connectivity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Forged License Keys:** Attackers create fraudulent license keys by exploiting cryptographic weaknesses.
*   **Installation of Forged Keys:** These fraudulent keys are then installed on vulnerable Brocade Fabric OS platforms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Switch Details:**  Attackers need to acquire specific information about the targeted switch, including World Wide Names (WWNs), switch type, FOS version, installed licenses, and output from specific CLI commands. This information is often exchanged via plain text email.
*   **Ability to Forge Keys:** Attackers need to be able to create license keys that appear valid to the FOS software.
*   **Access to Installation:** Attackers need to be able to install the forged license keys on the target system, which could involve physical or remote access.
*   **Unauthorised Vendor:** The attacker acts as an illegitimate vendor to obtain the necessary information and distribute fraudulent keys.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Brocade Fabric OS platforms using a "license string" format and is resolved by using an "XML file" format for licenses or purchasing licenses from trusted vendors.
*   The document strongly advises obtaining licenses only from authorized vendors to prevent exposure to fraudulent keys.
*   The document provides a detailed list of both affected and unaffected products and versions of FOS.
*   The vulnerability does not affect products using license keys obtained from authorized vendors.
