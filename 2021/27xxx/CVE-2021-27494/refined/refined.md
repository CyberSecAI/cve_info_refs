Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-27494:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing STP files within affected applications. Specifically, the application does not check the length of user-provided data before copying it to a fixed-size, stack-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121):**  The core issue is a buffer overflow on the stack due to the missing length validation, which allows an attacker to write past the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** A successful exploit can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process. This means an attacker could potentially take full control of the application and, depending on the application's privileges, potentially the system itself.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local/User-initiated:** The attack requires the user to open a malicious STP file. This means the attacker needs to get a specially crafted file to the victim.
*   **Malicious file:** The specific vector is through the parsing of a malicious STP file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Crafting malicious STP files:** The attacker must be able to create a specially crafted STP file with an oversized payload to trigger the overflow.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the victim to open the malicious STP file using a vulnerable application.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by rgod, working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
*   The affected software includes Datakit CrossCADWare libraries bundled with Luxion KeyShot, and Siemens Solid Edge Viewer.
*   A patch was eventually made available by both Datakit and Luxion.
*   The Zero Day Initiative publicly disclosed the vulnerability as a 0-day due to the vendor not patching in time.

This information aligns with the official CVE description, providing more technical detail about the vulnerability.
