Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-27124

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation for the `expertise` parameter in the `search_result.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an authenticated SQL injection. This occurs because the `expertise` parameter is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords. The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to dump the `users` table, exposing credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to `search_result.php` with a specially crafted `expertise` parameter.
*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a normal patient user to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Valid User Credentials:** The attacker needs to have valid patient login credentials to access the vulnerable functionality.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application.

**Technical Details:**

The provided proof of concept demonstrates a union-based SQL injection technique:

1.  **Login:** Log in as a normal patient user.
2.  **Crafted Payload:** The attacker sends a POST request to `search_result.php` with the following payload in the `expertise` parameter:
    `Bone' union select concat('Username-',username),2,3,(select (@a) from (select(@a:=0x00),(select (@a) from (information_schema.schemata) where (@a) in (@a:=concat(@a,schema_name,'<br>'))))a),concat('Password','-',password),6,7,8,9,10,11,12 from users#`

    This payload does the following:
    *   `Bone'`:  This part is likely attempting to close the original SQL query's `WHERE` clause, by supplying a common value to filter by.
    *   `union select ...`: This is the core SQL injection, it adds an additional query to the original one.
    *   `concat('Username-',username),2,3,...`: This part constructs the output, selecting the username and password from the `users` table, along with other fields to match the number of columns returned by the original query.
    *   `(select (@a) from (select(@a:=0x00),(select (@a) from (information_schema.schemata) where (@a) in (@a:=concat(@a,schema_name,'<br>'))))a)` This subquery extracts database schema information.
    *   `from users#`: Specifies the table to extract information from and the `#` comments out the rest of the original SQL query.

3.  **Data Extraction:** The response to the request will contain the results of the SQL injection, including usernames and passwords from the `users` table, as well as schema information.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability exists in version 1.0 of the "Doctor Appointment System".
*   The vulnerable file is `search_result.php` located within the `patient` directory.
*   The provided curl request example is very useful for replicating the attack.
