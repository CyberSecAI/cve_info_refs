Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-27249

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before it's used to execute a system call within the processing of CGI scripts. This allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The core weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary commands into a system call due to insufficient input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with root privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-Adjacent: Attackers need to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable D-Link DAP-2020 access point.
- Lack of Authentication: The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the target device.
- No prior authentication is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to send malicious requests to the vulnerable CGI script.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in the processing of CGI scripts, specifically related to the `WEB_CmdFileList` command.
- The advisory indicates that D-Link has released a patch to correct this vulnerability and a beta hotfix firmware is available for download.
- This vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2020-09-08.
- The affected device is D-Link DAP-2020, specifically the Ax hardware revision and firmware version v1.01 and below.
