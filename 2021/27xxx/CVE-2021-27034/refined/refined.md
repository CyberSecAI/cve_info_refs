Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27034:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length before copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer during the parsing of various file formats in Autodesk Design Review.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** This is the primary vulnerability, occurring when data larger than the allocated buffer is copied without proper length validation.
*   **Out-of-bounds read:** In some cases (TIF, TGA), the vulnerability leads to reading past the end of an allocated buffer, which can lead to information disclosure.
*   **Out-of-bounds write:** In some cases (TIF), the vulnerability allows writing data past the end of an allocated buffer which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Files:** The primary attack vector involves crafting malicious files (PICT, RLC, DWF, TIF, TGA) that, when opened by a user, trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Malicious Web Pages:**  The vulnerability can also be triggered if the user visits a malicious page that attempts to parse crafted files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, such as opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious website.
*   **Local Access:** Although the vulnerabilities are classified as remote code execution, exploitation occurs locally on the user's machine.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability affects Autodesk Design Review versions 2018, 2017, 2013, 2012, and 2011.
*   Autodesk has released an update (2018 Hotfix 4) to correct this vulnerability.
*  Multiple different file formats (PICT, RLC, DWF, TIF, TGA) are affected by different variations of this same vulnerability.
