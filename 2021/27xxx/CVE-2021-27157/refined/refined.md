Based on the provided content, CVE-2021-27157 is related to **Hardcoded credentials** present in the HTTP server of FiberHome HG6245D routers.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `webs` binary (HTTP Server) contains a list of hardcoded credentials for different ISPs, which are compiled into the firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hardcoded credentials within the web server's binary.
- The credentials include usernames and passwords that can be used to gain access to the router's web interface, and sometimes to enable the CLI telnet server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the router's web interface, potentially allowing them to change settings, access sensitive information, or further compromise the device.
- In some cases, the hardcoded credentials can be used to enable the CLI telnet server, which can provide a shell on the device with the possibility for privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- The web interface is accessible over HTTP/HTTPS on the LAN.
- The web interface is also reachable over IPv6 from the WAN due to a lack of firewall rules for IPv6 connectivity by default.
- The credentials can be used via the login form at `https://<router_ip>/fh`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to reach the web interface of the router (either from the LAN or from the WAN via IPv6).
- No previous authentication is needed, as the credentials are hardcoded.
