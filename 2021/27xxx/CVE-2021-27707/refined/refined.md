    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formDelPortMapping` function. The `portMappingIndex` parameter is directly copied to a stack-based local variable using `strcpy`, without proper bounds checking.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"

    "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code by sending a crafted GET request. This is achieved by overflowing the buffer and overwriting the function's return address on the stack.",

      "Crafted GET request"
