Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27151:

**CVE-2021-27151:** This CVE is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities found in FiberHome HG6245D routers and is related to **Hardcoded credentials in the HTTP server**.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `webs` binary (HTTP server) contains a list of hardcoded credentials. These credentials can be used to authenticate to the web interface, specifically the `/fh` path, which then allows access to the CLI telnet service on port 23/tcp.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hardcoded Credentials:** Multiple username/password combinations are embedded within the HTTP server binary.
- **Lack of Credential Management:** The device does not provide a mechanism to change or disable these default credentials.
- **Cleartext Storage:**  Although not directly related to this CVE, the document highlights that other credentials are also stored in clear text in configuration files and nvram.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the web interface using the hardcoded credentials.
- **Remote Code Execution (Chained with other vulnerabilities):**  By logging in with the hardcoded credentials, an attacker can enable the telnet service and potentially achieve remote code execution by chaining this with other vulnerabilities like the authentication bypass or hardcoded credentials for the Linux telnet server.
- **Device Compromise:** Full control of the device can be achieved.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need network connectivity to the router's web interface. This can be from the LAN or WAN, especially given the lack of IPv6 firewall rules.
- **HTTP Requests:** Attackers send HTTP(S) requests to the router's web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the web interface of the router.
- **Knowledge of Hardcoded Credentials:** The attacker must use one of the hardcoded username/password combinations found in the `webs` binary.
