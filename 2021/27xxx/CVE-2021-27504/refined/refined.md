Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-27504:

**Root Cause:**
*   Integer overflow vulnerability in the `malloc` function when handling extremely large values on Texas Instruments devices running FreeRTOS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Improper calculation of memory allocation size due to an integer overflow.
*   The `malloc` function returns a valid pointer to a small buffer, even when a very large memory allocation is requested.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Code execution.
*   The vulnerability can cause unexpected behavior such as a crash or remote code injection/execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Local access with high complexity. The attacker needs to provide an input that leads to the integer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs local access and the ability to trigger the memory allocation with specific inputs that leads to the overflow condition.
*   The attacker does not need to have user interaction.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered with low privileges.
