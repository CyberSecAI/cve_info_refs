## Siemens Tecnomatix Plant Simulation SPP File Parsing Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-21-569ZDI-CAN-13287

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-27397](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-27397) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | Siemens |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Tecnomatix Plant Simulation |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Siemens Tecnomatix Plant Simulation. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of SPP files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |

SSA-983548: Multiple SPP File Parsing Vulnerabilities in Tecnomatix
Plant Simulation

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

2021-05-11
2021-05-11
V1.0

SUMMARY

Siemens Tecnomatix Plant Simulation has released an update for version V16.0 that ﬁxes multiple
vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the application reads SPP ﬁles. If a user is tricked to open a
malicious ﬁle using the affected application, this could lead to a crash, and potentially also to arbitrary
code execution or data extraction on the target host system.

Siemens recommends to update to the latest version and to avoid opening of untrusted ﬁles from unknown
sources.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

Tecnomatix Plant Simulation:
All versions < V16.0.5

Update to V16.0.5 or later version
https://support.sw.siemens.com/ (login required)

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Do not open untrusted SPP ﬁles from unknown sources

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Tecnomatix Plant Simulation allows you to model, simulate, explore and optimize logistics systems and
their processes. These models enable analysis of material ﬂow, resource utilization and logistics for all
levels of manufacturing planning from global production facilities to local plants and speciﬁc lines, well in
advance of production execution.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s

environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-27396

The PlantSimCore.dll library lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing SPP ﬁles.
This could result in a stack based buffer overﬂow, a different vulnerability than CVE-2021-27398.

An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
