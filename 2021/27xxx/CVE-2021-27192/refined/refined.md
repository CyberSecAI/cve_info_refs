The provided content is related to CVE-2021-27192.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the incorrect privilege assignment when the Netop Vision Pro student client opens Internet Explorer (IE) for technical support. The IE process runs with System privileges because the Netop client itself runs as System.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-269):** The IE process launched for technical support inherits the System privileges of the parent Netop client process.
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** Due to the elevated privileges of the IE process, a local user can gain System-level access using standard techniques like navigating to `cmd.exe` through the "Save as" dialog.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation (LPE):** A local user can escalate their privileges to System level by using the "Save as" button within the IE window to execute a shell as the system user.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** With System level privileges, an attacker can execute arbitrary code and gain full control of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local access:** An attacker needs local access to a computer running the vulnerable Netop Vision Pro student client.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires minimal user interaction, specifically clicking the "Technical Support" button in the Netop interface and interacting with the "Save as" dialog.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be a local user on a system with a vulnerable version of Netop Vision Pro student client installed.
- The attacker does not require any special network access, since the vulnerability is exploited locally.
