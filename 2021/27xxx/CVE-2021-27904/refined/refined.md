The provided content is related to a commit that fixes a security issue in MISP. Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `all_orgs` flag in the sharing group object was being used too permissively. It was triggering the sharing group object to be viewable by all local organizations, even when the flag was set for a non-local instance.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Exposure:** The vulnerability allowed sharing group objects to be visible to organizations that should not have access to them, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Incorrect Authorization:** The authorization logic was flawed, not properly validating the intended scope of the `all_orgs` flag.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to sharing group objects by different organizations within the MISP instance. This could lead to information leakage and potential security breaches.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation would likely not require direct interaction with MISP as the vulnerability existed within the system logic, allowing unauthorized users to potentially access information intended for specific organizations. The attacker needs to be a user within the MISP system to potentially gain unauthorized access

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- A user with access to the MISP instance who could leverage the flawed logic to view unauthorized data.
- An understanding of the MISP data structure and authorization mechanisms would be helpful to discover and exploit the flaw.

**Technical details:**
- The fix modifies `app/Model/SharingGroupServer.php` by adding a condition to the query that checks for both `all_orgs` and `server_id=0`. The vulnerability was found in the `checkIfAuthorised` method.
- The commit message states the flaw was reported by Jeroen Pinoy.
