Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-27030:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of user-supplied paths when parsing filenames within ZIP files. Specifically, when the Autodesk FBX Review application handles filenames specified within a ZIP file, it does not properly validate the path before using it in file operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The lack of proper path validation allows an attacker to specify paths that traverse directories outside the intended scope.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By exploiting the directory traversal vulnerability, an attacker can place malicious files in arbitrary locations and trigger their execution within the context of the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** While not the primary impact for CVE-2021-27030, other vulnerabilities within the same advisory could lead to DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious FBX File:** An attacker can craft a malicious FBX file containing a ZIP archive with specially crafted file paths.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The user must open the malicious FBX file to trigger the vulnerability. This implies a social engineering component to the attack.
*   **Local attack vector:** The CVSS vector specifies AV:L, so the attacker is assumed to be local to the victim's machine. This likely means the malicious file is delivered to the machine through other means, and user interaction is required to open the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create malicious FBX/ZIP files:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a file that contains a malicious ZIP archive with directory traversal payloads.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker must trick the user into opening the malicious FBX file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Autodesk FBX Review versions 1.4.1.0 and 1.5.0.
*   The vulnerability was reported by "rgod" and "Mat Powell" of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
*   Autodesk has released version 1.5.2 to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   The CVSS score is 7.8 (High) with vector AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
