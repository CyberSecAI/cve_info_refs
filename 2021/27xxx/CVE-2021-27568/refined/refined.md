      "Related": true,
      "details": {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The parser fails to throw a ParseException when the input is expected to be a float but is not a valid number, leading to an uncaught `NumberFormatException`.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
          "Uncaught `NumberFormatException` during float parsing in `JSONParserBase`",
           "Improper input validation/sanitization of float values"
        ],
        "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by providing malformed JSON input that triggers the uncaught exception, potentially crashing the application or disclosing sensitive information.",
        "Attack vectors": "Providing malformed JSON input containing invalid float representations (e.g., \"-.\", \"2e+\", \"[45e-\") to the JSON parser.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `JSONParserBase`, which is typically called during JSON parsing operations within the application."
      },
	"notes" : "The provided information shows that `json-smart-v1` and `json-smart-v2` are vulnerable. The vulnerability is tied to `NumberFormatException`, which can lead to DoS. The fix involves catching the exception and converting it to a `ParseException`. The content also includes the discussion on the score of the CVE, with an argument that the confidentiality impact might not be as high as initially rated by MITRE, along with a discussion that the vulnerability can disclose the java virtual machine type. Finally, the provided content also includes the patch for the vulnerability in `json-smart-v2`."
