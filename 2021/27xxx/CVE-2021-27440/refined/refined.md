The provided content is related to CVE-2021-27440.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The software contains a hard-coded password it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of a hard-coded password (CWE-259)
- Code Injection (CWE-94)
- Execution with unnecessary privileges (CWE-250)

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to take full control of the digital fault recorder (DFR), remotely execute code, or escalate privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The hard-coded password vulnerability is remotely exploitable with low skill level.
- Code injection is remotely exploitable with low skill level but requires an authenticated user.
- Execution with unnecessary privileges requires local access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote, unauthenticated access for the hard-coded password vulnerability.
- Remote, authenticated access for the code injection vulnerability.
- Local access for execution with unnecessary privileges.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected product is the GE Reason DR60 digital fault recorder.
- All firmware versions prior to 02A04.1 are vulnerable.
- The advisory also lists mitigations such as upgrading the firmware, network segmentation, access controls and using VPNs for remote access.
- The advisory lists related CVEs: CVE-2021-27438 (Code Injection), and CVE-2021-27454 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges).
