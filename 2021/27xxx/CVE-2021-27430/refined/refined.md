Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-27430:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of hard-coded credentials within the UR bootloader binary. Specifically, versions 7.00, 7.01, and 7.02 of the bootloader included unused hardcoded credentials. Additionally, a user with physical access can interrupt the boot sequence by rebooting the UR.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Hard-coded credentials present in the bootloader.
- Lack of protection against boot sequence interruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to:
- Complete compromise of the device (high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact).
- Ability to gain unauthorized access.
- Ability to potentially alter the device's operation through the compromised bootloader.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Physical access to the UR IED is required to interrupt the boot sequence.
- Exploitation through the hard-coded credentials could possibly be done remotely if the attacker can find a way to interface with the bootloader remotely (not explicitly stated but implied).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs physical access to the UR IED to interrupt the boot process.
- For the exploitation of the hardcoded credentials, no specific capabilities are mentioned, other than potentially interfacing with the bootloader.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is specific to the UR bootloader versions 7.00, 7.01, and 7.02.
- The provided text has a CVSS v3 base score of 8.4 with the vector string (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
