Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27029:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied values before they are dereferenced as pointers during the parsing of FBX files. This can lead to a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null Pointer Dereference: The application attempts to access a memory location through a null pointer, leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: The application crashes when the null pointer dereference occurs, leading to a denial of service.
- The Autodesk advisory also states, "Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to remote code execution and/or denial-of-service."

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious FBX file: The attacker needs to create a specially crafted FBX file that triggers the null pointer dereference.
- User Interaction: The victim must open the malicious FBX file in the vulnerable software (Autodesk FBX Review).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious FBX file.
- The attacker needs to somehow get the victim to open the malicious file. This can be done through social engineering or other means of file transfer.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Autodesk FBX Review versions 1.5.0 and prior.
- Autodesk has released a fix in version 1.5.2.
- The vulnerability was reported by rgod.
- The ZDI advisory provides a CVSS score of 7.8, vector `AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`, which indicates a high severity vulnerability that requires user interaction, but has a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This vector differs from the one provided in the Autodesk document.
