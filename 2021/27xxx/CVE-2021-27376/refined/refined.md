- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `nb-connect` crate incorrectly assumes that `std::net::SocketAddrV4` and `std::net::SocketAddrV6` have the same memory layout as the system C representation `sockaddr`. It performs direct pointer casting to convert between the Rust and C socket address representations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The crate relies on an undocumented memory layout for `std::net::SocketAddr`, which can lead to invalid memory access if the Rust standard library changes its internal representation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** This can lead to invalid memory access, potentially causing crashes or undefined behavior. The CVSS score indicates a high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** Network. The vulnerability is triggered when network connections are established.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special privileges or user interaction are needed. The attacker just needs to be able to initiate a network connection using the vulnerable code.
