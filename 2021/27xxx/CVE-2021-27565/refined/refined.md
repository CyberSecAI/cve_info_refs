Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-27565:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the HTTP request processing of the NicheStack TCP/IP stack. When an unknown HTTP request is received, the software invokes a panic function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of unknown HTTP requests.
- Invocation of a panic function upon receiving an unknown request.
- This panic function, if not handled properly by the user's implementation (specifically, if it doesn't have a trap invocation removed), results in an infinite loop leading to a denial of service (DoS).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): The affected device will enter an infinite loop, causing it to become unresponsive or reset.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request that the NicheStack HTTP server does not recognize.
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the target device running NicheStack.
- No authentication is required.
- Ability to send arbitrary HTTP requests.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is part of a larger set of 14 vulnerabilities called INFRA:HALT, discovered by Forescout and JFrog.
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of NicheStack before version 4.3, including NicheLite.
- A fix for this vulnerability is present in NicheStack v4.3 with `in_httpsvr` module v1.7.
- The vulnerability is also identified by the vendor as `HCCSEC-000017`.
- This vulnerability is present in the HTTP component.
