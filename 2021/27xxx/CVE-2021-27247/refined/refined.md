- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the WXAM decoder, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the WXAM decoder.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure. An attacker could potentially leverage this vulnerability with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**:  A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious page or file to a user. User interaction is required for exploitation.
