Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-27272

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper validation of user-supplied paths within the `ReportTemplateController` class when parsing the `path` parameter. The system does not properly sanitize the path before using it in file operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The lack of input validation allows an attacker to manipulate the path parameter, potentially traversing directories and accessing files outside of the intended scope.
- **File Deletion:** Specifically, the vulnerability allows for deletion of arbitrary files on the system.
- **Authentication Bypass:** Although authentication is required, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can leverage the vulnerability to delete files, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Limited Integrity Impact:** While the impact on Confidentiality is None and Availability is High, the ability to delete files also has a Low impact on the systemâ€™s integrity because an attacker can not create or modify files, only delete them.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over a network.
- **Network Access:** Attackers require network access to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass authentication, so they do not need valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Low Privilege Access:** While authentication is bypassed, the attack requires the equivalent of a "Low" privilege, which means no special privileges are required for successful exploitation
- **Network Connectivity:** Attackers need to be able to send requests to the vulnerable system over the network.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported to NETGEAR on 2020-10-28.
- NETGEAR released a fix for this vulnerability
- The affected product is NETGEAR ProSAFE Network Management System, specifically version NMS300 running firmware versions prior to 1.6.0.27.
- The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-21-355 and ZDI-CAN-12123 by the Zero Day Initiative.
