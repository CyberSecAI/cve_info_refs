        "cve_id": "CVE-2021-27290",
        "description": "ssri 5.2.2-8.0.0, fixed in 8.0.1, processes SRIs using a regular expression which is vulnerable to a denial of service. Malicious SRIs could take an extremely long time to process, leading to denial of service. This issue only affects consumers using the strict option.",
        "affected_components": [
            "ssri npm package"
        ],
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a poorly designed regular expression used when processing Subresource Integrity (SRI) strings. Specifically, the regex `^([^-]+)-([A-Za-z0-9+/=]{44,88})(\\?[\\x21-\\x7E]*)*$` which is used with the `strict` option enabled. The vulnerable part is  (\\?[\\x21-\\x7E]*)*$. When a long string of question marks is passed followed by an invalid character, it can cause exponential backtracking which leads to a DoS.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
            "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"

            "Crafting a malicious SRI string and passing it to a vulnerable instance of `ssri` with the `strict` option enabled."
