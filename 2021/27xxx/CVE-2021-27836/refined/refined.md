Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27836:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a NULL pointer dereference in the `xls_parseWorkSheet()` function of the libxls library. This occurs when the function attempts to access members of a `xlsWorkSheet` struct pointer (`pWS`) that is NULL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is that `xls_parseWorkSheet()` does not check if the provided `xlsWorkSheet` pointer is NULL before accessing its members. This leads to a crash when `pWS` is NULL.
- **Misuse of Library:** The vulnerability can be triggered due to the misuse of the libxls library, specifically not checking for a valid sheet count before calling `xls_getWorkSheet`. The function `xls_getWorkSheet()` returns a NULL pointer if the sheet number is invalid.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a crash (SIGSEGV) due to the NULL pointer dereference, resulting in a denial of service. This prevents the program using libxls from processing the crafted file.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted XLS File:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted XLS file that does not contain any `BoundSheet8` records. This causes `pWB->sheets.count` to be zero. When the program then tries to access a worksheet it receives a NULL pointer which is then passed to `xls_parseWorkSheet`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to provide a malicious XLS file:** An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted XLS file to the application using the vulnerable library.

**Technical details:**
- The `xls_getWorkSheet()` function returns a NULL pointer if the requested sheet number is invalid.
- The `xls_parseWorkSheet()` function dereferences this potentially NULL pointer without validation, resulting in a crash.
- The vulnerable code is located in `xls_parseWorkSheet()` function where it tries to access the `filepos` member of the `pWS` parameter : `long offset = pWS->filepos;`
- The crash occurs when accessing the filepos member of the null `pWS` pointer.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability was found in the `test.c` and `test2.c` example files of the libxls project.
- A patch was proposed to add a check for NULL pointers in the beginning of the `xls_parseWorkSheet()` function.
- Another suggested fix was to change the condition at `xls_getWorkSheet()` from `if (num >= 0 && num < (int)pWB->sheets.count)` to `if (num >= 0 && num <= (int)pWB->sheets.count)`.
- The issue was addressed in libxls version 1.6.2-5, and updates were released for Fedora 33, 34, and 35.
