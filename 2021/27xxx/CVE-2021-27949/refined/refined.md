{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "User input attached to CSRF token-protected POST requests, inserted into hidden form fields on custom Moderator Tools action confirmation pages, is not properly sanitized.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflected XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the hidden form fields, which are then reflected back to the user's browser when the confirmation page is loaded, potentially leading to various malicious actions, such as session hijacking or data theft.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through specially crafted POST requests to custom Moderator Tools action confirmation pages. The malicious input is embedded in form fields.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious POST request with a payload that would be inserted into the hidden form fields. Although CSRF protection is in place, the XSS vulnerability can still be triggered through a malicious request."
