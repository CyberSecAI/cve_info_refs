Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in HashiCorp Vault Enterprise's Disaster Recovery (DR) secondary nodes. Specifically, the `/sys/license` API endpoint on these secondary nodes was accessible without authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Authentication:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of authentication enforcement on the `/sys/license` endpoint of DR secondaries, which should not be accessible without proper authorization.
- **Exposure of License Metadata:** Although the license itself was not exposed, the metadata associated with the license could be read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could read license metadata from DR secondary nodes without needing to authenticate. This could potentially reveal information such as license type, expiration dates, enabled features, or other details related to the license, which could be valuable to an attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to a Vault DR secondary node.
- **Direct API Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by making a direct API request to the `/sys/license` endpoint of the Vault Enterprise DR secondary.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access to DR Secondary:** The attacker must have network connectivity to at least one of the Vault Enterprise DR secondary nodes.
- **No Authentication Needed:**  The attacker does not need any pre-existing access or authentication to exploit this vulnerability on the DR secondary nodes.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was identified by an external party and reported to HashiCorp.
- The issue is identified as **HCSEC-2021-05** by Hashicorp.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Vault Enterprise version 1.6.3 and later.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 202207-01) references this CVE and suggests users upgrade to version 1.10.3 or later. It is worth noting that the gentoo advisory lists the affected version as < 1.10.3 but the fix is in 1.6.3.
