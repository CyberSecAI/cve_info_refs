The provided content includes information about CVE-2021-27174.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Credentials (Wi-Fi passwords, WEP keys, radius keys) are stored in clear-text within configuration files on the filesystem.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Clear-text storage of sensitive information.
- Inadequate file permissions, making files readable by unauthorized users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with access to the device's filesystem can easily retrieve sensitive information, such as Wi-Fi passwords, potentially compromising the network.

**Attack vectors:**
- Physical access to the device's file system.
- Successful exploitation of other vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to read files on the device (e.g., RCE).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to access the device's file system. This may require the exploitation of other vulnerabilities, such as remote command injection, or physical access to the device.
