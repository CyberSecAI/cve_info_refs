**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-After-Free vulnerability in `iscsi_snapshot_comm_core` service within Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on affected Synology DSM installations.
- This vulnerability can be leveraged, potentially in combination with other vulnerabilities, to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through crafted web requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send crafted web requests to the affected Synology DSM device.
- Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attack vector is described as "network adjacent", suggesting that the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device to achieve initial exploitation.
