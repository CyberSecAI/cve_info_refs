Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-27645:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a double-free error in the `addgetnetgrentX` function within the `netgroupcache.c` file of the glibc library's Name Service Caching Daemon (nscd). This was introduced as a regression while attempting to fix a use-after-free issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Double Free:** A memory buffer allocated to store netgroup information is freed twice, leading to a crash. This occurs because of a flaw in how the "live" allocation of the buffer is tracked during resizing and other operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is the crashing of the nscd daemon. This crash could disrupt services that rely on nscd for name resolution and netgroup lookups, leading to a degradation or complete denial of service on the local system.
*  Although the freed object isn't directly used after being freed, the crash itself constitutes a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when nscd processes a request for netgroup lookup.
*   Specifically, the double-free occurs when a netgroup request generates a response that exceeds a certain size (greater than 1KB, as mentioned in the sourceware.org bug report). This triggers reallocation logic in the vulnerable code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must be able to trigger the vulnerable code path by sending a netgroup request to the local nscd service.
*   **Specific Netgroup Request:** The attacker needs to generate a specific type of netgroup request that causes the nscd response to exceed the buffer's initial allocation, which is then reallocated via `xrealloc`.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced by a patch that attempted to fix a use-after-free.
*   The double-free occurs because a reference to an already freed object may escape into `tofree`.
*   The `xrealloc` function, which is used to reallocate memory, doesn't return NULL on failure, avoiding a different class of error but exposing the double-free issue.
*   The vulnerability is located in the `nscd` component of `glibc`.
*   The fix involves better tracking of the "live" allocation to prevent the double-free.
