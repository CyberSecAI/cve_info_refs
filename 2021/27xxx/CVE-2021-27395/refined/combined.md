Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

• Deactivate following incoming rules in the local Windows ﬁrewall:

– PH Redundancy Services
– PH Wcf MessageQueue Service (RedundancyMaintenanceService)
– PH Wcf MessageQueue Service (SqlMirroringSetup)
– PH Wcf MessageQueue Service (MaintenanceService)
– PH SQL-Server Mirroring Port (UDP)
– PH SQL-Server Mirroring Port (TCP)

• In case SIMATIC Process Historian is used as a redundant system, restrict remote IP addresses in

the ﬁrewall rules to allow only access for the Master, the Standby and the Mirror server

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SIMATIC Process Historian is the long term archive system for SIMATIC PCS 7, SIMATIC WinCC and
SIMATIC PCS neo. It stores process values, alarms and batch data of production plants in its database
and offers historical process data to reporting and visualization applications.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-27395

An interface in the software that is used for critical functionalities lacks authentication, which could
allow a malicious user to maliciously insert, modify or delete data.
