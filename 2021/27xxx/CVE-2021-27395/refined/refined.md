Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27395:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of authentication on an interface used for critical functionalities within SIMATIC Process Historian.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306):** The software interface lacks proper authentication, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Manipulation:** A malicious user can insert, modify, or delete data within the system's database due to the lack of authentication on the critical interface.
- **High Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** As indicated by the CVSS score, successful exploitation can lead to severe compromise of data confidentiality, integrity and system availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network access (AV:N). Specifically, this appears to relate to the configuration interface of redundant PH instances. Although the vulnerable interface is restricted to local access on recent versions starting from SIMATIC Process Historian 2020, earlier versions are vulnerable via network access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable interface. This may be a local access on versions of the software starting with SIMATIC Process Historian 2020.
- No privileges are required (PR:N), and no user interaction is needed (UI:N).
- Exploitation is considered easily achievable (AC:L).
- The exploit is proven to exist (E:P).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of SIMATIC Process Historian, including versions 2013 and earlier, 2014, 2019, and 2020.
- Siemens has released updates for some affected products and recommends upgrading to the latest versions. Workarounds are suggested for cases where updates are not immediately available.
- Mitigations involve deactivating specific Windows firewall rules and restricting remote IP addresses for redundant systems.
