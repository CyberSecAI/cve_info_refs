**Vulnerability:** Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')

*   **Root Cause:** The affected applications do not validate webpage input.
*   **Weaknesses:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input validation.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML code into a webpage, allowing them to modify the page and display incorrect or undesirable data. This could potentially lead to phishing attacks, session hijacking, or other malicious activities depending on the context of the application.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML code through webpage input.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide input to the web application that is not properly sanitized before being rendered to the end user. This can typically be achieved by sending a crafted HTTP request with malicious content to the application. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
