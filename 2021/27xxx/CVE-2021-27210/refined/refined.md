- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The TP-Link Archer C5v stores all credentials, including the root's credentials, in clear text on the device.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper authorization, clear text storage of credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Any authenticated user on the local network, even if not authorized, can access all credentials, including root credentials. This can lead to complete compromise of the router. Furthermore, a weak cryptography vulnerability (mentioned in another blog post by the same author) can allow any user on the network to obtain the credentials of logged-in users and also root privileges on the router.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specific HTTP request to the router. The specific request isn't shown in this content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the local network.
