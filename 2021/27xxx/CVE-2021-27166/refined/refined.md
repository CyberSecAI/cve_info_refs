- **Root Cause:** Hardcoded credentials within the Telnet CLI server.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The Telnet CLI server contains hardcoded credentials for the 'gpon' user, specifically 'gpon'/'gpon' and 'enable: gpon'. Also, there are other hardcoded credentials specific to certain ISPs. Additionally, there's an authentication bypass vulnerability that allows access to the CLI without logging in using a specific crafted string.
- **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the device's CLI interface. This can lead to further exploitation, such as starting a root shell on the device.
- **Attack Vectors:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability via the telnet port 23/tcp. This requires network access to the device.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker requires network access to the telnet server on the device (port 23/tcp). This can be from the LAN or WAN if IPv6 is enabled without firewall rules. The attacker needs to know or guess the hardcoded username/password combinations or utilize the auth bypass.
