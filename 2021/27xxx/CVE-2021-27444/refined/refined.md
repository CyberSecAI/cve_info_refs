Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27444:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Improper access control within the Weintek cMT product line's EasyWeb interface. This allows an attacker to bypass security measures intended to protect sensitive data and administrative functions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The system fails to adequately restrict access to sensitive information and administrative actions. This allows unauthorized access and manipulation by remote attackers.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An unauthenticated remote attacker can:
    *   Access sensitive information.
    *   Download sensitive information.
    *   Perform administrative actions on behalf of a legitimate administrator.
    *   Potentially gain full control of the device.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the network.
*   **Unauthenticated access:** No prior authentication is required, making exploitation easier for attackers.
*   **Web interface (EasyWeb):** The vulnerability exists within the EasyWeb configuration web interface of the affected devices.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device, specifically to the web interface (port 80). The device must be exposed to an open network, which can be accessed by a public IP.
*   **Low skill level:** The CISA advisory notes that the vulnerability is exploitable with a low skill level.
*   **No authentication required:** The attacker doesn't need to have valid credentials.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in EasyWeb V1.1 on cMT devices with OS versions prior to specific dates listed in the advisory (e.g., cMT-SVR-1xx/2xx versions prior to 20210305).
*   The vendor advisory explicitly mentions that devices exposed to an open network are vulnerable, emphasizing that the vulnerability is exploitable over the internet with a public IP address.
*   The vendor recommends disconnecting the device from an open network and updating the OS to mitigate the vulnerability, suggesting it is present in a web server whose version is below V1.2
