Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27738:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies in the lack of access control checks for the REST API endpoints under `/kylin/api/streaming_coordinator/*` within `StreamingCoordinatorController.java` of Apache Kylin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:**  The primary weakness is the absence of authentication and authorization checks on the specified REST API endpoints. This allows unauthenticated users to access and manipulate the streaming coordinator functionalities.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** For endpoints accepting node details in the HTTP request body, a limited SSRF vulnerability is present. This means an attacker can cause the server to make requests to other locations, albeit with some limitations in what can be specified or achieved.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access to Coordinator:** An attacker can issue arbitrary requests to the Kylin Coordinator without authentication. This includes actions such as:
    *   Assigning or unassigning streaming cubes.
    *   Creating, modifying, and deleting replica sets.
*   **SSRF:** A limited SSRF vulnerability could be exploited by sending specific crafted request body which includes nodes details, allowing the attacker to cause the Kylin server to make requests to other systems. The exact impact of SSRF is not fully clear but could lead to information disclosure, internal network scanning or other potential vulnerabilities depending on the internal services that are reachable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is through network access to the Apache Kylin server hosting the vulnerable `StreamingCoordinatorController.java`.
*   **Direct API Calls:** The attacker would directly interact with the vulnerable REST API endpoints (`/kylin/api/streaming_coordinator/*`) via HTTP requests.
* **Request Body Manipulation:** For SSRF, the attacker would need to craft a request with node details in the request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the Apache Kylin server hosting the vulnerable service.
*   **Knowledge of API Endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the API endpoints in `StreamingCoordinatorController.java` to target the attacks.
* **Ability to forge HTTP request:**  The attacker needs to be able to forge HTTP requests, including request body if exploiting the SSRF

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability affects Apache Kylin 3 versions prior to 3.1.2.
*   The provided information is more descriptive than the placeholder CVE description.
*   The fix is to upgrade to version 3.1.3 or apply the patch linked in the email.
