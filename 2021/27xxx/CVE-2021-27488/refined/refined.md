Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-27488:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing CATPart files. This is within the Datakit CrossCADWare library, which is embedded in other applications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787):** The insufficient validation allows an attacker to write data beyond the allocated buffer, causing an out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process. This could allow an attacker to take control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have the malicious CATPart file on the local system.
*   The user needs to interact by opening the malicious CATPart file in an affected application like Siemens Solid Edge Viewer or Luxion KeyShot

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted CATPart file to the user.
*   The attacker can be a local attacker or someone who has tricked the user into opening the malicious file.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple products which use the vulnerable Datakit library.
*   The vulnerability was disclosed publicly as a zero-day due to lack of timely patching.
*   Mitigation includes updating the affected software to a version with the patched Datakit library, and avoiding the opening of untrusted files.
