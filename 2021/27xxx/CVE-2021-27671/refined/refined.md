- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `comrak` library was performing case-sensitive matching of unsafe URL prefixes (e.g., `data:`, `javascript:`), allowing prefixes with different casing (e.g., `Data:`) to bypass the sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient input sanitization, specifically case-sensitive matching of unsafe URL prefixes in the markdown processing. This allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution within the context of a user's browser, potentially allowing attackers to steal cookies, session tokens, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing crafted markdown content that contains unsafe URLs with manipulated casing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to supply crafted markdown content to a system or application that uses `comrak` for markdown processing. User interaction is required (e.g., by viewing the malicious markdown content).
