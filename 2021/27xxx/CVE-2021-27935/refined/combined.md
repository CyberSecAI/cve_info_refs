# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### **[jvoisin](/jvoisin)** commented [Dec 21, 2020](#issue-772381498)

| It [seems](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/blob/bdff46ec1dc8bfebaea236fef5e4ea64b4f21738/internal/home/auth.go#L279-L289) that the username as well as the bcrypt'ed password have their sha256 stored in the cookie.  This is a bit worrying, since an attacker able to get the cookie would not only gain access to AGH, but also be able to bruteforce offline the password. A possible way to address this would be to use a random string instead of `sha256(salt | username | bcrypt(password))`. |
