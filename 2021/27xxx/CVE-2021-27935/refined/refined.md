**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the storage of a SHA256 hash of the username and bcrypt-hashed password directly within the user's cookie.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is the storage of the password hash in the cookie, making it possible to brute-force the password offline if the cookie is obtained.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker who obtains a user's cookie can bruteforce their password offline, gaining unauthorized access to the AdGuard Home application.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based, and an attacker needs to obtain a valid user's cookie.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have access to a user's cookie to conduct the offline brute-force attack. This could be achieved through various methods like man-in-the-middle attacks, or by compromising the user's machine.
