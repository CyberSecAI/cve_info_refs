# Tectia vulnerability CVE-2021-27892

**What is the vulnerability?**

 It is a local privilege escalation exploit.

**Which Tectia versions are vulnerable?**

 All Tectia Client and Server versions running on Windows (before version 6.4.19) are vulnerable.

**I’m only running Tectia on UNIX, Linux or z/OS, does this affect me?**

 No, only Windows installations are vulnerable.

**I’m using ConnectSecure, is it affected?**

  ConnectSecure running on Windows is vulnerable.

**I’m using Universal SSH Key Manager, PrivX, Tectia Manager or CryptoAuditor, are they affected?**

No.

**How likely is it that my system has been a target?**

 The exploit requires that a malicious user is able to access the target system. This vulnerability was discovered internally by SSH.COM. There is no evidence of any system having been a target of an attack, and we consider it unlikely.

**What do I need to do?**

 Please upgrade all Tectia Clients and Servers that are running under Windows to version 6.4.19.

**Where can I download Tectia 6.4.19?**

* If you have a valid support contract, please use the [customer download center](https://downloads.ssh.com/).
* If you don’t have a valid support contract, you can [renew it](https://www.ssh.com/about/contact?hsLang=en).

**I have version 6.4.18, how safe is it to upgrade to 6.4.19?**

 6.4.19 is a patch release, so it only contains security fixes to the vulnerabilities, plus a few important fixes where the connection would fail in some corner cases.

**I have been running 6.4.18 as a LTS version how does this affect Long Term Support?**

 Version 6.4.19 is part of the 6.4 LTS stream, so the LTS contract will be transferred to it. It will be valid until March 2023.

**I have version 6.4.17, what do I do?**

 Upgrade to 6.4.19. Version 6.4.18 is widely used and stable and it has only one known regression, which is also fixed in 6.4.19. Please see the [server](https://documents.ssh.com/articles/Documentation/Tectia-SSH-Server-6-4-Release-Notes/) and [client](https://documents.ssh.com/articles/Documentation/Tectia-SSH-Client-6-4-Release-Notes/) release notes.

**I have version 6.4.16 or earlier, what do I do?**

 These versions are out of support. Please upgrade to 6.4.19.

**I have a very old version (6.3 or earlier), what do I do?**

 Please upgrade to 6.4.19; see [this link](https://www.ssh.com/manuals/server-admin/64/server-upgrading.html?hsLang=en) for details on version compatibility.
