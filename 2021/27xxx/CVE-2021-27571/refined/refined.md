Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-27571:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Remote Mouse application transmits sensitive information about running and recently used applications in cleartext without any authentication or encryption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cleartext Transmission:** Application data, including the names, icons, and file paths of running and recently used applications, is transmitted over the network without encryption.
*   **Missing Authentication:** There is no authentication mechanism to protect this information from unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can retrieve a list of recently used and currently running applications, their associated icons, and their file paths. This information can reveal sensitive details about the victim's activities and software usage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker can passively intercept network traffic between a device running the Remote Mouse client and the computer running the Remote Mouse server.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker positioned on the network path between the client and server can eavesdrop on the communication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim or have the ability to intercept network traffic between the client and server.
*   No prior authentication is required. The attacker does not need to have any credentials for the Remote Mouse application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Remote Mouse versions up to and including 3.015.
*   The vendor was notified of the vulnerability but did not patch it in the 4.0.0.0 release.
*   The `axelp.io` content provides more detail on the vulnerability than the official CVE description.
