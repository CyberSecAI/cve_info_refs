Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27145:

**Vulnerability:**

- **CVE-2021-27145** is related to **Hardcoded credentials in the HTTP server** of FiberHome HG6245D routers. This is one of several CVEs associated with this issue.

**Root Cause:**

- The `webs` binary (HTTP server) contains a list of hardcoded credentials, allowing access to the web interface and potentially the CLI telnet interface.

**Weaknesses:**

- **Hardcoded Credentials:** Multiple sets of credentials, including usernames and passwords, are embedded within the `webs` binary. This includes credentials for different ISPs, as well as general administrative accounts.
- **Lack of Unique Credentials:** The use of default and hardcoded credentials allows unauthorized access with publicly available information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can use these hardcoded credentials to gain unauthorized access to the router's web interface.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Once logged in, attackers can enable the CLI telnet service, and potentially achieve root access via other vulnerabilities like the telnet backdoor, or the Linux telnet with hardcoded credentials.
- **Full Control:** Successful exploitation could give the attacker full control of the device, leading to malicious activities such as data theft, network manipulation, or the device being used in a botnet.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Interface:** The hardcoded credentials can be used directly on the web login page at `https://<router_ip>/fh`.
- **Telnet Access:** After logging into the web interface, attackers could enable and access the CLI telnet interface (port 23/tcp) using additional backdoors, further compromising the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the router's web interface. This could be from the LAN, but also over IPv6 via the WAN due to the lack of IPv6 firewall rules.
- **Knowledge of Credentials:** The attacker needs to know or discover the hardcoded credentials (username and password) which are present in the `webs` binary.
- **Web Browser:** The attacker would need to interact with the device using a web browser.

**Additional Information:**

- Multiple sets of credentials were found including: `user`/`user1234`, `f~i!b@e#r$h%o^m\*esuperadmin`/`s(f)u\_h+g|u`, `admin`/`lnadmin`, `admin`/`CUadmin`, `admin`/`admin`, `telecomadmin`/`nE7jA%5m`, `adminpldt`/`z6dUABtl270qRxt7a2uGTiw`, `gestiontelebucaramanga`/`t3l3buc4r4m4ng42013`, `rootmet`/`m3tr0r00t`, `awnfibre`/`fibre@dm!n`, `trueadmin`/`admintrue`, `admin`/`G0R2U1P2ag`, `admin`/`3UJUh2VemEfUtesEchEC2d2e`, `admin`/`getOnuMac(s, 6, 32);`, `admin`/`888888`, `L1vt1m4eng`/`888888`, `useradmin`/`888888`, `user`/`888888`, `admin`/`1234`, `user`/`tattoo@home`, `admin`/`tele1234`, `admin`/`aisadmin`
- The `getOnuMac()` function uses the last part of the `br0` MAC address as part of the password for the `admin` user.
