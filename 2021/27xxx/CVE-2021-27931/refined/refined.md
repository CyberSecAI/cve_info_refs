The provided content is a GitHub repository containing a proof-of-concept (PoC) for an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability. The PoC targets Lumis XP before version 10.0.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application processes XML data without proper sanitization, allowing the inclusion of external entities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XXE Injection:** The vulnerability lies in the insecure parsing of XML data, specifically the processing of external entities. The PoC demonstrates how a malicious XML payload can be crafted to include an external entity (e.g., using `<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://tester.cybia.io">`) which is then used in the XML processing, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive server-side information by forcing the server to request a URL controlled by the attacker, which will then be included in the response. This can be used to exfiltrate data or to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF).
- The PoC, by using a remote URL, can be used to potentially leak information by causing the server to send a request to the specified server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is initiated by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to `/lumis/portal/controller/xml/PageControllerXml.jsp`.
- **Malicious XML Payload:** The POST request body contains the malicious XML payload with the external entity injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
