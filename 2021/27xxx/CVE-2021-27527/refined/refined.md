{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed via the `valueID` parameter before rendering it in the HTML context.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform social engineering attacks by redirecting users to fake websites, steal cookies leading to account takeover, download malware on their systems and many more attacking scenarios.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `valueID` parameter and lures a user into accessing it.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL and get a user to access it. The user must be logged into the DynPG admin panel."
