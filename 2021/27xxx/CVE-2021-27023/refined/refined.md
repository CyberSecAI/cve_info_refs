Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way Puppet Agent and Puppet Server handle HTTP redirects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unsafe HTTP Redirects:** The core issue is that when encountering an HTTP redirect, the software might leak HTTP credentials by sending them to a different host than the one originally intended.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Leakage:** An attacker could potentially intercept and obtain sensitive HTTP credentials used by the Puppet agent or server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could set up a malicious server that issues an HTTP redirect when the Puppet agent or server tries to communicate with it. This could be done by compromising an existing server or creating a new one designed for this attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Position:** The attacker would need to be in a position to intercept or control the network traffic between the Puppet agent/server and a targeted legitimate server.
- **Malicious Server Setup:** The attacker must have the ability to set up a malicious server capable of issuing an HTTP redirect.
