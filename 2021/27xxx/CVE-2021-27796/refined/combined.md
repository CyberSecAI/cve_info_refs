CVE-2021-27796

**Summary

Security Advisory ID : BSA-2021-1721

Component : shell

Revision : 1.0**

A vulnerability in Brocade Fabric OS versions before Brocade Fabric OS v8.0.1b, v7.4.1d could allow an authenticated attacker within the restricted shell environment (rbash) as either the â€œuserâ€ or â€œfactoryâ€ account, to read the contents of any file on the filesystem utilizing one of a few available binaries.

An attacker gains complete knowledge of any file contents on the system with what seems to be the equivalent of root permissions. This could lead to a complete compromise of data confidentiality.
