- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerability exists in Brocade Fabric OS that allows an authenticated attacker within the restricted shell environment (rbash) to read any file on the filesystem by using a few available binaries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The restricted shell environment (rbash) does not properly restrict access to certain binaries, allowing file read access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the restricted shell can read any file on the filesystem, gaining complete knowledge of the system's files, leading to a complete compromise of data confidentiality.
- **Attack vectors:** Authenticated access to the restricted shell environment (rbash) as either the "user" or "factory" account is required. The attacker then utilizes available binaries to read files on the filesystem.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated access to the restricted shell environment as either "user" or "factory" is required.
