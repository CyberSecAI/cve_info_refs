Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to sanitize user-provided input when exporting data to a CSV file. Specifically, the application allows regular users to input text that includes spreadsheet formulas into client records.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CSV Injection (Formula Injection):** The core vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of user input that is included in a CSV export. By inserting malicious formulas (starting with `=`) into a text field, an attacker can cause the spreadsheet program to execute those formulas when the CSV file is opened.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application doesn't validate or sanitize user inputs before including them in a CSV export, which leads to the injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Actions:** When an admin exports client data to a CSV file and opens it using a spreadsheet program (like Excel or LibreOffice Calc), the injected formula is executed. This can lead to:
    *   **Redirection to harmful websites:** The injected formula can be used to redirect the admin to a malicious website.
    *  **Data disclosure:** The injected formulas can be used to steal and disclose data that the regular user should not have access to, such as other client details within the exported CSV.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **User-Supplied Input:** A regular user can inject malicious formulas into the client record's text field.
*   **CSV Export:** The attack is triggered when an authenticated administrator exports client details to a CSV file and opens that file with a spreadsheet program.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Regular User Account:** The attacker needs a regular user account on the vulnerable application.
*   **Ability to Input Data:** The attacker must be able to input data, which can include malicious spreadsheet formulas, into a text field of a client record.
