The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in FiberHome HG6245D routers. CVE-2021-27155 is one of the vulnerabilities related to hardcoded credentials within the HTTP server.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of CVE-2021-27155, along with CVE-2021-27143, CVE-2021-27144, CVE-2021-27145, CVE-2021-27146, CVE-2021-27147, CVE-2021-27148, CVE-2021-27149, CVE-2021-27150, CVE-2021-27151, CVE-2021-27152, CVE-2021-27153, CVE-2021-27154, CVE-2021-27156, CVE-2021-27157, CVE-2021-27158, CVE-2021-27159, CVE-2021-27160, CVE-2021-27161, CVE-2021-27162, CVE-2021-27163, and CVE-2021-27164, is the presence of numerous hardcoded credentials within the web server's binary (`webs`). These credentials can be used to log in to the web interface, gaining access to device management.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hardcoded credentials within the `webs` binary.
- The hardcoded credentials include different usernames and passwords like `user/user1234`, `admin/lnadmin`, `admin/admin`, `telecomadmin/nE7jA%5m`, `rootmet/m3tr0r00t` and many others.
- The hardcoded credentials also include a username `admin` with the password being the last part of the MAC address of the `br0` interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the device's web management interface.
- With access, an attacker can enable the CLI telnet server, modify device configurations, and potentially achieve full control over the router.
-  This vulnerability can be used in conjunction with others, such as the telnet backdoor, to gain a root shell.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the web interface on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).
- Attackers can attempt to log in using the hardcoded credentials discovered in the `webs` binary.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs network access to the device's web management interface. This could be from the LAN or WAN (if IPv6 is enabled without proper firewall).
- No prior authentication is required to attempt login with the discovered hardcoded credentials.
