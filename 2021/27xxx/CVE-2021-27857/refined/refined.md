Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27857:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control on backup archive files. Specifically, the application fails to authenticate access to configuration backup files, allowing retrieval via a direct HTTP GET request. The filename structure is predictable, with the only unknown part being the hostname.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The application exposes configuration backup files without proper authentication or authorization checks, directly referencing them by filename in HTTP requests.
- **Predictable Filenames:** The filename structure is predictable, enabling attackers to easily craft requests to download backup files.
- **Lack of Authentication:** The application does not require authentication to access the backup files via the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The configuration backup files contain sensitive information, such as usernames, hashed passwords, and network configurations.
- **Authentication Bypass:** The exposed credentials can be used for authentication bypass, providing unauthorized access to the system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can use the information to elevate their privileges within the system.
- **Full System Access:** The vulnerability can ultimately lead to full system access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** Attackers exploit this vulnerability by sending an HTTP GET request to the predictable URL for the backup configuration file.
- **Direct Object Reference:** The vulnerability is triggered due to the application directly exposing objects (backup files) based on user-supplied input without authorization checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the vulnerable device.
- **Knowledge of Hostname:** The attacker needs to know (or guess) the hostname of the system to construct the URL to access the backup file.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The content provides a specific URL format for accessing configuration backup files, as well as examples using `curl`.
- The vulnerability affects multiple FatPipe products, including WARP, IPVPN, and MPVPN.
- The document lists specific affected versions, which range from very old versions (5.x) up to 10.2.2r38.
- The exploit can lead to access to the `Xpasswd` file, which contains user credentials, including the "Administrator" and "fatpipe" users.
- The advisory timeline shows that the vulnerability was first discovered in May 2016 and again in July 2021.  The vendor was contacted in July 2021 and fixes were provided in August/September 2021.
- Vendor provided fixed versions 10.1.2r60p92 and 10.2.2r43, and for 9.1.2: 9.1.2r161p31 and 9.1.2r180p9.
