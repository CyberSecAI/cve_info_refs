Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27250:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the processing of CGI scripts within the D-Link DAP-2020 access point's firmware. Specifically, the issue is in how the `errorpage` request parameter is handled.
*   The device fails to properly validate user-supplied paths within the `errorpage` parameter before using them in file operations. This lack of input validation allows an attacker to control the file path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **External Control of File Name:** The primary vulnerability is the ability for an attacker to manipulate the filename or path used by the device when processing the `errorpage` parameter.
*   **Path Traversal:** The lack of proper validation can lead to a path traversal vulnerability, where an attacker can specify paths outside the intended directory structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information, potentially including stored credentials.
*   **Further Compromise:** Disclosed credentials can be used to gain further access and compromise the device and possibly the network it's connected to.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Adjacent Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable by attackers who are on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.
*   **CGI Script Manipulation:** The attacker sends a crafted request to the device, manipulating the `errorpage` parameter in a CGI script request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network or be able to access the same network segment where the vulnerable D-Link DAP-2020 device is located.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any authentication to the device.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by SUID, working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI)
*   D-Link has released a firmware update (v1.03rc004 Beta) to address the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is present in the (non-US) DAP-2020 Hardware Revision A with firmware v1.01.
