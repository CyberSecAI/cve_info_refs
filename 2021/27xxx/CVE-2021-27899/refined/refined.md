- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of the ITM Server's certificate by the Proofpoint Insider Threat Management Agents (formerly ObserveIT Agent) for MacOS and Linux.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Insufficient certificate validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can intercept and alter communications between the agent and the ITM server using a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:**  A network-based man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the affected agent and the ITM server. This implies the attacker needs to be on the same network segment or have the ability to route traffic through a malicious intermediary.
