Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE-2021-27410**

*   **Root Cause:** An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the affected Hillrom products.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Out-of-Bounds Write (CWE-787):** This vulnerability allows an attacker to write data beyond the intended memory buffer, potentially corrupting data or executing arbitrary code.
    *   **Out-of-Bounds Read (CWE-125):**  While this CVE is specifically about the write issue, the document also mentions a related out-of-bounds read vulnerability (CVE-2021-27408) which can be chained with the out-of-bounds write to achieve arbitrary code execution. The read vulnerability causes information leakage.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Memory corruption
    *   Remote execution of arbitrary code.
    *   Information leakage
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploitable remotely
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be on the same network or have network access to the affected devices
    *   Low privileges are required
