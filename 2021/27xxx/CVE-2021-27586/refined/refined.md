{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing IFF files. This can result in a write past the end of an allocated data structure.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a specially crafted IFF file. The target user must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious IFF file. User interaction is required for exploitation."
