- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web server of affected devices lacks proper bounds checking when parsing the Host parameter in HTTP requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow (CWE-120)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on the device with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending crafted HTTP requests with a maliciously crafted Host header to the vulnerable web server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote. They need network access to the vulnerable device.
