SUMMARY

A buffer overﬂow vulnerability in the integrated web server of multiple APOGEE and TALON automation
devices could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the devices with root privileges.

Affected devices include the APOGEE MBC/MEC/PXC P2 Ethernet devices with Power Open Processors
(PPC), APOGEE PXC BACnet devices, and TALON TC BACnet devices.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens recommends countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet
available.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

• Please contact your local Siemens ofﬁce for support

• Restrict access to the device, especially to the web interface (80/tcp and 443/tcp), to trusted IP

addresses only

• Disable the integrated web server

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to
run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The APOGEE MEC and the MBC are high-performance Direct Digital Control (DDC) devices and are an
integral part of the APOGEE Automation System.

The APOGEE PXC Modular and Compact Series are high-performance Direct Digital Control (DDC)
devices and an integral part of the APOGEE Automation System.

The TALON TC Modular and Compact Series are high-performance Direct Digital Control (DDC) devices
and an integral part of the TALON Automation System.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-27391

The web server of affected devices lacks proper bounds checking when parsing the Host parameter in
HTTP requests, which could lead to a buffer overﬂow.

An unauthenticated remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the
device with root privileges.
