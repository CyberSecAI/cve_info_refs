The provided content relates to CVE-2021-27411.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow or wraparound in the `Mem_DynPoolCreate`, `Mem_DynPoolCreateHW`, and `Mem_PoolCreate` functions of Micrium OS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer wraparound vulnerability leading to incorrect memory allocation. Specifically, when allocating a very large block of memory, the integer wraparound can result in the allocation of a small memory block.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unexpected behavior such as very small blocks of memory being allocated instead of very large ones, which can lead to heap overflows and ultimately a crash or potentially remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing very large values to the vulnerable memory allocation functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker doesn't require special privileges or user interaction. Network access is sufficient. The vulnerability can be triggered remotely.
