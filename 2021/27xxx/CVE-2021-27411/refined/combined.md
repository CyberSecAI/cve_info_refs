Micrium OS

# Micriμm OS

The Micrium brand is one that is well known to many embedded software developers. RTOS components from Micrium have been in use since days when the IoT was little more than a vague concept. Today, though, Micrium OS offers developers a reliable, professional-grade software platform for a broad spectrum of IoT projects.

1. ##### Overview

## Micrium OS Introduction

At the heart of any embedded OS is a kernel, which provides vital task scheduling and multi-tasking services to ensure that the timing requirements of your application code can be met, even as you regularly update and expand that code with new features.  Micrium OS is more than a kernel, though, providing a number of additional modules to help you meet your project’s needs.  Here is a summary of the Micrium OS components:

###

| Component |  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Real-Time Kernel](/developer-tools/micrium-os/micrium-real-time-kernel) |  | A highly reliable foundation for your multi-task application code. |
| [File System](/developer-tools/micrium-os/micrium-file-system) |  | A flexible implementation of the FAT file system with support for multiple types of storage device |
| [USB Device](/developer-tools/micrium-os/micrium-usb-device) |  | A full-featured stack for implementing the device side of the USB protocol, including class support for CDC, HID, and MSC, as well as a framework for vendor-defined classes. |
| [USB Host](/developer-tools/micrium-os/micrium-usb-host) |  | An embedded USB host stack with support for the MSC, HID, CDC, USB2Ser, and AOAP classes. |
| [Network](/developer-tools/micrium-os/micrium-tcp-ip-networking) |  | A TCP/IP stack with support for IPv4 and IPv6, along with a number of popular application protocols. |

## Licensing

Micrium OS is provided entirely free of charge for deployment on Silicon Labs EFM32 and EFR32 devices!  You can begin adding Micrium’s professional-quality components to your projects today without payment of any licensing fees.

1. ##### Getting Started

## Download and Install Simplicity Studio

Micrium OS is distributed exclusively through Simplicity Studio.  Within Studio, you’ll find tools for easily adding the Micrium OS kernel to new projects, along with various Micrium-based software examples.  To install Studio, choose the appropriate software package below.

ICS Advisory
# Multiple RTOS (Update E)

Last RevisedApril 19, 2022
Alert CodeICSA-21-119-04

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v3 9.8**
* **ATTENTION:** Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity
* **Vendors:** Multiple
* **Equipment:** Multiple
* **Vulnerabilities:** Integer Overflow or Wraparound

CISA is aware of a public report, known as “BadAlloc” that details vulnerabilities found in multiple real-time operating systems (RTOS) and supporting libraries. CISA is issuing this advisory to provide early notice of the reported vulnerabilities and identify baseline mitigations for reducing risks to these and other cybersecurity attacks.

The various open-source products may be implemented in forked repositories.

## 2. UPDATE INFORMATION

This updated advisory is a follow-up to the advisory update titled ICSA-21-119-04 Multiple RTOS (Update D) that was published November 30, 2021, to the ICS webpage on www.cisa.gov/uscert.

## 3. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in unexpected behavior such as a crash or a remote code injection/execution.

### 4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 4.2.1    [INTEGER OVERFLOW OR WRAPAROUND CWE-190](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

Media Tek LinkIt SDK versions prior to 4.6.1 is vulnerable to integer overflow in memory allocation calls pvPortCalloc(calloc) and pvPortRealloc(realloc), which can lead to memory corruption on the target device.

[CVE-2021-30636](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-30636) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)).

#### 4.2.2    [INTEGER OVERFLOW OR WRAPAROUND CWE-190](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

* Zephyr Project: Update to [2.5 or later](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr).  Patches available for prior supported versions. See the Zephyr [security advisory](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/security/advisories/GHSA-94vp-8gc2-rm45) for more information.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Apply available vendor updates.
* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
