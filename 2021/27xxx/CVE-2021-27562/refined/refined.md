The provided content is related to a fix for an erroneous FPU configuration in the Nordic nRF platform within Trusted Firmware-M, but it does not describe a security vulnerability. It describes a bug fix related to incorrect initialization of the FPU, which was causing a failed assertion.

Specifically:
- **Root cause of the issue:** Incorrectly attempting to configure the FPU peripheral on nRF91 series devices where it's not configurable and always non-secure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** None are present. The issue is a bug in the initialization logic that lead to an assertion failure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** There is no exploitation scenario described. The issue leads to a failed assertion, indicating a software bug.
- **Attack vectors:** There are no attack vectors associated with this code change.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No attacker capabilities or position is relevant as it is a bug fix.

The commit message provides details on the problematic scenario and the fix:

- The FPU is not configurable in NRF91 series devices.
- The FPU is always non-secure on the NRF91 series.
- The code was attempting to configure the FPU which caused an assertion failure during initialization.
- The fix configures the FPU only in NRF53 series devices that have a configurable FPU.

Based on the information available, this is not a security vulnerability, but a bug fix.
