The provided content is related to CVE-2021-27099.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The "aws\_iid" Node Attestor in SPIRE improperly normalizes the path provided through the agent ID templating feature.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper path normalization in the "aws_iid" Node Attestor.
- The agent ID templating feature uses an EC2 tag value as the last element in the path, which, if controlled by an attacker, can be used to issue an arbitrary SPIFFE ID within the same trust domain.
-  SPIRE Server accepts non-normalized SPIFFE IDs, allowing for potentially inconsistent behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker who controls the value of an EC2 tag can potentially obtain an arbitrary SPIFFE ID within the same trust domain. This could lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation within the SPIRE infrastructure.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker controls the value of an EC2 tag prior to attestation.
- The `aws_iid` attestor is configured for agent ID templating where the tag value is the last element in the path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to control the value of an EC2 tag used in the agent ID template.
- The attacker must have access to a node that can be attested via the vulnerable `aws_iid` attestor.
