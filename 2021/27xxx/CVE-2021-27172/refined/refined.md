Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2021-27172:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the presence of hardcoded credentials for the Linux telnet server. Specifically, the password for the `root` user is hardcoded within the `/etc/init.d/system-config.sh` script, which is used to set up the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hardcoded Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the use of a static, easily discoverable password ("GEPON") for the root user on the Linux telnet server. This bypasses the need for complex password cracking techniques.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full System Compromise:** An attacker who gains access to the Linux telnet server with these credentials can obtain a root shell on the device. This gives the attacker complete control over the device, including the ability to read, modify, and delete any files and reconfigure or disable services.
- **Device Takeover:** The attacker can use this root access for further malicious activities, such as establishing a persistent backdoor, using the device for botnet participation, or intercepting/modifying network traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the device on port 26.
- **Telnet Server:** The Linux telnet server is not running by default, but can be started by exploiting other vulnerabilities (e.g., the CLI telnet interface).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be on the same network (LAN) or be able to reach the device via IPv6.
- **Telnet CLI Access:** An attacker needs to trigger the start of the Linux telnetd server, which can be accomplished by:
   - Exploiting the CLI telnet server's authentication bypass to run shell commands.
   - Using the HTTP server's backdoor API to enable the CLI telnet and then starting the Linux telnetd through this CLI.
   - Exploiting a stack overflow in an older version of the HTTP server to run code that starts the telnetd.

**Technical Details:**
- The hardcoded password for the root user is found in the `/etc/passwd` file after being written by the startup script: `/etc/init.d/system-config.sh`
- The password `GEPON` corresponds to the DES-encrypted string `W/xa5OyC3jjQU`
- This telnet server on port 26 is separate from the CLI telnet server that runs on port 23/tcp and can be started from the telnet CLI.

**In summary, CVE-2021-27172 describes a critical vulnerability that allows an attacker to gain root access to FiberHome routers by exploiting a hardcoded password in the Linux telnet server. This, in combination with other vulnerabilities can lead to full device compromise.**
