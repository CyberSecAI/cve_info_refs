Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-27470:

**CVE-2021-27470**

*   **Vulnerability:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502)
*   **Affected Product:** Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk AssetCentre, v10.00 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The `LogService.rem` service in FactoryTalk AssetCentre does not properly verify serialized data during deserialization.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote, unauthenticated network access.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker can send crafted, malicious serialized data to the affected service.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the FactoryTalk AssetCentre server. This can lead to complete system compromise.
*   **CVSS Score:** 10.0 (Critical)
*   **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Summary:**

The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of deserialized data by the `LogService.rem` service. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this by sending specially crafted data, resulting in arbitrary command execution on the server. This poses a significant security risk, potentially leading to a full compromise of the system. The provided content has more technical details than the brief CVE description.
