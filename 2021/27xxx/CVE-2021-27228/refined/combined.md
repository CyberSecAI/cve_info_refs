## Kind Words

"I am a huge fan of open source and am writing code myself. However Zoneminder is a mess. Been trying to use it for like 10 years. But it never worked reliably. More than 3 cameras almost always made it fail. RTSP never worked reliably. Shinobi took me minutes to set up on my mini PC and is feeling so reliable already. Reinventing the wheel may be bad. But let's face it: Zoneminder is doomed. The horse is dead. Let's get off.﻿"

Community Member on YouTube

"Shinobi is a thin shell around FFmpeg."

Core Developer of ZoneMinder

"I would suggest Shinobi as a NVR. It's still in the early days but works a lot better than ZoneMinder for me. I'm able to record 16 cams at 1080p 15fps continuously whith no load on server (Pentium E5500 3GB RAM) where zm crashed with 6 cams at 720p. Not to mention the better interface."

A Reddit user from /r/HomeNetworking

"THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS AMAZING SOFTWARE! So much better than Orchid Core, Zoneminder, and Milestone; this is lightweight and I have been using it for almost 1 year."

William

"Ive been using it awhile and I love it. I was running a version from May 2018 and its been rock solid for over a year﻿"

Community Member on Discord

"omg guys i just want to say thank you so much!! I LOVE SHINOBI, and @moeiscool thank you so much for such an amazing ipcam recording app, please always keep it open source! I plan on using nothing else!!"

## Why Make This?

The founder of Shinobi Systems, Moe Alam, wanted to make a cloud video recording solution. One that anyone could easily use. Simply login to your account, add camera details, set options, and away you go. Viewing streams and recordings on your mobile device by simply opening a web page. No installations. This means you could view it on any device with a capable browser.
