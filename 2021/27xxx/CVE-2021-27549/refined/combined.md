# Genymotion[¶](#genymotion "Permanent link")

This section introduces Genymotion Desktop user interface and actions you can perform from the different windows. It also lists the user interface keyboard shortcuts.

Genymotion Desktop settings can be reached by clicking on **Genymotion** â **Settings**.

## Account and license settings[¶](#account-and-license-settings "Permanent link")

![Account](../Resources/Screenshots/account_tab.png)

In the **Account** section, you can **SIGNOUT**, [register a License](../Get_started/015_License/) or connect to a [company license server](/license_server/03_Users_guide/).

## Proxy settings[¶](#proxy-settings "Permanent link")

This setting allows Genymotion to connect to our servers through a proxy - it does not apply to the virtual devices.

From the **Settings** window, click on the **Network** tab. There, you can modify the network settings to set a HTTP proxy.

![Network settings window](../Resources/Screenshots/settings_window.png)

To define your proxy settings, check the corresponding boxes:

* **Use HTTP Proxy**: Enables Genymotion Desktop to use a proxy when connecting to Genymobile servers. Set your HTTP proxy address and port in the corresponding fields.
* **Use authentication**: Enables proxy authentication. Enter your proxy username and password in the corresponding fields.

## Hypervisor settings[¶](#hypervisor-settings "Permanent link")

 [3.3.0](https://www.genymotion.com/blog/release-note/genymotion-desktop-3-3-0/)

From Genymotion Desktop 3.3.0 onwards, it is possible to choose between VirtualBox and QEMU hypervisor:

1. In the **Hypervisor** section, use the drop-down box to select your preferred Hypervisor:

   ![Hypervisor_select](../Resources/Screenshots/Settings_hypervisor.png)
2. If you change from default or the previously selected hypervisor, you will be prompted to restart Genymotion to apply the change.

Each created virtual device depends on the hypervisor. For example, Virtual devices created with VirtualBox will disappear from Genymotion dashboard if the hypervisor is switched to QEMU, and vice versa.

In the **Virtual Device** section, you can choose where the virtual devices images are stored:

![Hypervisor settings](../Resources/Screenshots/Settings_hypervisor_2.png)

It is not recommended to change this setting, unless you are familiar with VirtualBox and QEMU.

## Use third party ADB/SDK[¶](#use-third-party-adbsdk "Permanent link")

By default, Genymotion Desktop uses its own built-in Android tools, located in the following paths:

WindowsmacOSLinux
```
C:\Program Files\Genymobile\Genymotion\tools\

```

```
/Applications/Genymotion.app/Contents/MacOS/tools/

```

```
$HOME/genymotion/tools/

```

However, if you use an IDE such as Android Studio, you may need to use specific Android tools. In that case, you can follow these steps:

 Android StudioAndroid SDK tools

The easiest way to get the Android SDK tools is to install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) . By default, Android Studio installs the SDK tools in the following folders:

WindowsmacOSLinux
```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk

```

```
$HOME/Library/Android/sdk

```

```
$HOME/Android/Sdk

```

After installing Android Studio, open Genymotion and:

1. Go to *Genymotion > Settings > ADB*
2. Select **Use custom Android SDK tools**
3. Click **Browse** to set the path to the Android SDK:

![ADB AS](../Resources/Screenshots/adb_third_party.png)

You must set the path to the SDK tools root, such as `Android\SDK`, not the `platform-tool` sub-folder. For example, `%LocalAppData%\Android\Sdk` is valid whereas `%LocalAppData%\Android\Sdk\platform-tools` is incorrect.

Android command-line tools require Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment.

If you don't wish to install Android Studio, you will need to use `sdkmanager` from the *Android stand-alone command-line tools* to install ADB:

We recommend using `androidsdk` from [snap](https://snapcraft.io/androidsdk)  instead of `sdkmanager` on Ubuntu.

sdkmanagerandroidsdk

1. Download Android Studio command-line tools from [https://developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/studio/#command-tools)
2. Extract the archive files in the folder of your choice and go to the `tools/bin/` sub-folder.
3. In a terminal or command shell, use the following commands:

```
sdkmanager "platform-tools"

```

1. Install `androidsdk` from [snap](https://snapcraft.io/androidsdk)
2. In a terminal, run the following command:

```
androidsdk "platform-tools"

```

This will install the platform-tools in the current folder. You can use the `--sdk_root={directory}` option to install the tools in a different folder.

Then, in Genymotion:

1. Go to *Genymotion > Settings > ADB*
2. Select **Use custom Android SDK tools**
3. Click **Browse** to set the path to the Android SDK:

![ADB w/o AS](../Resources/Screenshots/adb_third_party_no_AS.png)

You must set the path to the SDK tools root, not the `platform-tool` or `build-tools` sub-folders. For example, if you installed the tools in *C:\adt-bundle*, `C:\adt-bundle\` is a valid whereas `C:\adt-bundle\platform-tools` is incorrect.

## Clipboard sharing[¶](#clipboard-sharing "Permanent link")

Clipboard sharing between the OS and the VD is enabled by default, but it can be disabled in the **Device** section:

![Clipboard settings](../Resources/Screenshots/shared_clipboard.png)

Genymotion settings - Device

## Screen capture folder[¶](#screen-capture-folder "Permanent link")

The folder where screen captures and screencasts are saved can be changed in the **Device** section. Default value is your home folder.

## Misc[¶](#misc "Permanent link")

In the **Misc** section, you can control whether Genymotion collects usage statistics or not, and clear Genymotion cache:

![Misc](../Resources/Screenshots/misc_settings.png)

Genymotion Settings - Misc

## Shortcuts[¶](#shortcuts "Permanent link")

The table below lists global shortcuts that can be used in Genymotion Desktop:

| Action | Windows/Linux | macOS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add a new virtual device | `Ctrl`+`N` | `Cmd`+`N` |
| Open Genymotion Desktop settings | `Ctrl`+`,` | `Cmd`+`,` |
| Open virtual device settings | `Ctrl`+`I` | `Cmd`+`I` |
| Delete virtual device | `Del` | `Del` or `Fn`+`Backspace` |
| Duplicate virtual device | `Ctrl`+`D` | `Cmd`+`D` |
| Generate virtual device log archive | `Ctrl`+`K` | `Cmd`+`K` |
| Quit Genymotion Desktop | `Ctrl`+`Q` | `Cmd`+`Q` |

Virtual Device shortcuts can be viewed and customized with the [Settings widget](../04_Emulating_sensors_and_features/#shortcuts).
