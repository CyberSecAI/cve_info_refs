The provided content is related to CVE-2021-27116.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `MemProf` and `GetCPUProfile` functions in Beego's admin module do not properly check if a file already exists before creating it. This allows an attacker to create a symbolic link to another file, and then have the Beego application write profiling data to the linked file, potentially overwriting or corrupting it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper file handling: The application does not verify the existence of a file before writing to it.
- Symlink vulnerability: Attackers can create symlinks to files they don't normally have write access to, and then have the vulnerable application write data to those files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized file rewriting: An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system by using symbolic links.
- Potential privilege escalation: If the Beego application runs with elevated privileges (e.g., root), a lower-privileged user can exploit this vulnerability to rewrite files that would normally be inaccessible to them, thus potentially escalating their privileges.
- Data corruption: The profiling data written to the linked file could overwrite valuable configuration or application data, causing data corruption and possible service disruptions.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker needs local access to the system where the Beego application is running.
- Symbolic link creation: The attacker creates a symbolic link to the target file using a command like `ln -s other/logs cpu-pid.pprof`.
- Triggering the vulnerable function: The attacker then needs to trigger the vulnerable `MemProf` or `GetCPUProfile` function to write data to the created symbolic link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create symbolic links: The attacker must be able to execute commands that create symbolic links.
- Low-privileged access to the system where the Beego application runs.
- Knowledge of the location of files that could cause an impact.

**Additional Details:**
The discussion in the provided content confirms that the vulnerability exists in the admin module where profiling data is written to files specified by the `MemProf` and `GetCPUProfile` functions. It was also noted that this is not an isolated case and similar problems may exists with the creation of log files. It was decided that mitigation of this vulnerability will not be implemented in Beego, and that users should be responsible for the security of their servers.
