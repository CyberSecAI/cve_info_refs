The provided content is related to CVE-2021-27460.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the insecure deserialization of untrusted data within the .NET remoting endpoints of FactoryTalk AssetCentre components. The system does not sufficiently verify that the deserialized data is valid.

**Weaknesses:**
- Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502)

**Impact:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to gain full access to the FactoryTalk AssetCentre main server and all agent machines. This could lead to complete compromise of the system and the network it resides on.

**Attack Vector:**
The attack vector is remote and does not require authentication. It involves sending maliciously crafted serialized data to the vulnerable .NET remoting endpoints.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the exposed .NET remoting endpoints of FactoryTalk AssetCentre. No prior authentication or special privileges are required. The attacker can be located anywhere on the network that has access to the vulnerable service.
