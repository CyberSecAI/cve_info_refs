- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `_parse_options` function in `gnrc_rpl` casts packed structs without prior boundary checks. Specifically, it doesn't verify if the remaining data length is sufficient before casting to a struct.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing bounds checks when casting to packed structs within a loop in `_parse_options`. This allows for out-of-bounds reads.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Heap-buffer-overflow, leading to a crash due to out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted RPL control message with an invalid length, which triggers the vulnerable parsing function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious RPL message to a device running the vulnerable RIOT-OS code.
