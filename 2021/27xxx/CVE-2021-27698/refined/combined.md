| Description The implementation of `_parse_options` in `gnrc_rpl` has a problem very similar to the one described in [#16062](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/issues/16062): It casts packed structs without performing prior boundary checks. I think the loop code is in fact more or less a copy of the one in `gnrc_rpl_validation_options`, thus a fix very similar to [#16081](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/16081) will be needed for it too.  Consider for example the following code:     [RIOT/sys/net/gnrc/routing/rpl/gnrc\_rpl\_control\_messages.c](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/896e44cf931132801c1c6b18a3194ac44504dd24/sys/net/gnrc/routing/rpl/gnrc_rpl_control_messages.c#L619)  Line 619 in [896e44c](/RIOT-OS/RIOT/commit/896e44cf931132801c1c6b18a3194ac44504dd24)   |  | gnrc\_rpl\_opt\_target\_t \*target = (gnrc\_rpl\_opt\_target\_t \*) opt; | | --- | --- |      In this case it might be the case that `len < sizeof(gnrc_rpl_opt_target_t)`, however this case is not covered by the implementation currently. There are also other casts to packed structs in this function which have the same issue. Steps to reproduce the issue Use `examples/gnrc_networking`, activate `gnrc_pktbuf_malloc` and set `CONFIG_GNRC_RPL_DEFAULT_NETIF` to your netif (check with `ifconfig` in the shell provided by `gnrc_networking`) mine is `6`:  ``` diff --git a/examples/gnrc_networking/Makefile b/examples/gnrc_networking/Makefile index bf76931305..15132894c1 100644 --- a/examples/gnrc_networking/Makefile +++ b/examples/gnrc_networking/Makefile @@ -31,6 +31,9 @@ USEMODULE += netstats_l2  USEMODULE += netstats_ipv6  USEMODULE += netstats_rpl   +USEMODULE += gnrc_pktbuf_malloc +CFLAGS += -DCONFIG_GNRC_RPL_DEFAULT_NETIF=6 +  # Optionally include DNS support. This includes resolution of names at an  # upstream DNS server and the handling of RDNSS options in Router Advertisements  # to auto-configure that upstream DNS server. ```  I was also a bit too lazy to figure out how I can add an ULA to a `BOARD=native` network interface, to work around that I just made sure that `gnrc_rpl` uses the first available networking interface for DODAGs with the following patch (if you know how to configure a non-local address on a `BOARD=native` network interface please let me know):  ``` diff --git a/sys/net/gnrc/routing/rpl/gnrc_rpl_dodag.c b/sys/net/gnrc/routing/rpl/gnrc_rpl_dodag.c index 8b5e389c41..5f889c16eb 100644 --- a/sys/net/gnrc/routing/rpl/gnrc_rpl_dodag.c +++ b/sys/net/gnrc/routing/rpl/gnrc_rpl_dodag.c @@ -388,7 +388,7 @@ gnrc_rpl_instance_t *gnrc_rpl_root_instance_init(uint8_t instance_id, ipv6_addr_          return NULL;      }   -    if ((netif = gnrc_netif_get_by_ipv6_addr(dodag_id)) == NULL) { +    if ((netif = gnrc_netif_iter(NULL)) == NULL) {          DEBUG("RPL: no IPv6 address configured to match the given dodag id: %s\n",                ipv6_addr_to_str(addr_str, dodag_id, sizeof(addr_str)));          return NULL ```  **Note:** If you don't want to apply this patch, it should also be possible to reproduce this issue by adding a non-local IPv6 address to your network interface and passing that address to the `rpl root` command below.  Compile and run the application using:  ``` $ make -C examples/gnrc_networking all-asan $ make -C examples/gnrc_networking term  ```  In the RIOT term initialize the RPL root instance with the following command (the address passed to `rpl root` doesn't matter due to the patch from above):  ``` > rpl root 0 fd12:3456:789a:1::1  ```  Afterwards run `socat` as:  ``` # printf 'mwIAJwCmCwIFCQNzAT0AXgFWAQ==' | base64 -d | socat -u STDIN IP6-SENDTO:[<LL address>%tap0]:58  ``` Expected results The application shouldn't crash.

| Hmm, splitting the validation from the actual parsing seemed sensible back then (to optionally reduce ROM usage). But as the checking gets more complicated now, I think of completely removing the "optional validation" and make it mandatory to have a single processing loop. |
