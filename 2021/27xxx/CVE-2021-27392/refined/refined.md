- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key to encrypt user credentials for authentication between ONVIF clients and the ONVIF server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Hard-coded cryptographic key (CWE-321).
    - Unsecure storage of ONVIF user credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated remote attacker can retrieve and decrypt all user credentials stored on the ONVIF server, potentially allowing for unauthorized access and control of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access via the MIP SDK.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be authenticated to the system to retrieve and decrypt the credentials.
