WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Disable the Open Network Bridge (ONVIF), if not in use. Note: By default the Open Network Bridge

is disabled.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to
run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Siveillance Video (formerly called Siveillance VMS) is a powerful IP video management software designed
for deployments ranging from small and simple to large-scale and high-security. The Siveillance Video
portfolio consists of four versions, Siveillance Video Core, Core Plus, Advanced, and Pro, addressing the
speciﬁc needs of small and medium size solutions up to large complex deployments.

The Open Network Bridge is an open ONVIF compliant interface for standardized and secure video
sharing from Siveillance Video to other IP-based security systems. This enables law enforcement,
surveillance centers, or similar organizations (referred to as ONVIF clients) to access live and recorded
H.264 video streams from Siveillance Video to their central monitoring solutions.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-27392

Affected Open Network Bridges store user credentials for the authentication between ONVIF clients
and ONVIF server using a hard-coded key. The encrypted credentials can be retrieved via the MIP
SDK.

This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to retrieve and decrypt all credentials stored on the
ONVIF server.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Steps to apply the hotﬁx:

• Install the VideoOS.OpenNetworkBridge.Installer.exe and follow instructions on screen. You need
to update both the ONVIF Plug-in and ONVIF server. Remember to update ONVIF Plug-in on each
machine that is running Management Client.

• All previously conﬁgured ONVIF users will be removed after applying the hotﬁx, therefore ONVIF
users need to be readded again. To add Open Network Bridge users right click on the tray icon of
Open Network Bridge Manager and chose “Manage ONVIF client users. . . .”

• Fill in username and password of an ONVIF user, add the user and apply the settings.
