{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The FX Aggregator terminal client by \"Sovremennye Delovye Tekhnologii\" implements a lockout mechanism that suspends access for five hours after five invalid login attempts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of proper rate limiting or account lockout mechanism that prevents abuse. The system does not distinguish between legitimate and malicious login attempts.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service. A valid user account is locked for five hours.",
  "Attack vectors": "Remote attack via the login interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to attempt login to the client application. No other special access or privileges are needed."
