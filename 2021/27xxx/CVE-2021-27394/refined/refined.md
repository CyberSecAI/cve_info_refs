- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper privilege management allows authenticated, non-administrative users to modify their user roles under certain circumstances.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a non-administrative user to escalate their privileges to administrative level. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, system configurations, or other administrative functions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated non-administrative user within the affected Mendix application. They also need to be able to manipulate their user roles in a manner that is not normally permitted by the application.
