- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Mautic versions before 3.3.4 and 4.0.0 are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This is due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied data, specifically inline JavaScript in asset titles and broken image URLs in remote assets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The application fails to sanitize user-provided input (asset title and remote asset URL), allowing injection of malicious JavaScript.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement of the Mautic interface, or other malicious activities. The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application are rated as high.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious asset containing the XSS payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with permissions to create or edit assets. This indicates that the attack requires low privileges. User interaction is also required, as the victim would have to view the malicious asset to trigger the XSS. The attack complexity is high.
