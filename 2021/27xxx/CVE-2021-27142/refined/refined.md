- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web management interface uses a hardcoded private key for SSL/TLS, which is stored with 777 permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Hardcoded private key used for HTTPS.
  - The private key file is stored with 777 permissions.
  - The private key can be downloaded from the device over HTTPS.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can use the hardcoded private key to eavesdrop on encrypted communication to the web management interface, conduct man-in-the-middle attacks, or impersonate the device.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can either intercept HTTPS traffic to the web management interface to decrypt communications or can download the private key directly over HTTPS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the device, either on the LAN or WAN (over IPv6). They must be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack or directly connect to the device to download the key.
