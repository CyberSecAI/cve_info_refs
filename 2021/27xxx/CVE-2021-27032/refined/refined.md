- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Autodesk Licensing Installer has weak permissions that allow a malicious user to modify service configurations and take ownership of services running with elevated privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege escalation due to weak permissions on services.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Code execution due to the ability of a low-privileged user to modify service configuration and take ownership.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious user with limited privileges on the system can identify services with weak permissions that are running under elevated privileges. The malicious user can then modify the service configuration and take ownership of the service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have limited privileges on the system to be able to identify and exploit the vulnerable service permissions.
