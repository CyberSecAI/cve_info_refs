Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27462:

**1. Verification:**

*   The provided content from CISA (www.cisa.gov) explicitly mentions **CVE-2021-27462** and describes a deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability in Rockwell Automation's FactoryTalk AssetCentre. This confirms the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the way the `AosService.rem` service in FactoryTalk AssetCentre verifies serialized data. It does not properly sanitize or validate the data before deserialization.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Deserialization of untrusted data. The software is vulnerable because it processes serialized data without proper validation, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious objects.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the FactoryTalk AssetCentre system, leading to a complete compromise of the system.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via the network. Attackers send malicious serialized data to the vulnerable service through the network.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges on the target system to exploit this vulnerability. They only need to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   The CISA document also mentions other vulnerabilities in the same product, including OS command injection, SQL injection, and improper restriction of functions which are associated with different CVEs.
*   The document provides a CVSS v3 score of 10.0 for this vulnerability, indicating a critical severity.
*   The document states that no known public exploits are specifically targeting this vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2021-27462 is a critical vulnerability that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk AssetCentre systems by exploiting a flaw in the deserialization of data.
