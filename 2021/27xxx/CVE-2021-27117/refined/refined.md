The content relates to CVE-2021-27117.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `MemProf` and `GetCPUProfile` functions in Beego's admin module do not properly check if the created file exists before writing to it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Symlink attack vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Attackers can overwrite arbitrary files by creating a symlink to the target file, leading to potential privilege escalation or unauthorized modification of data if the application runs with elevated privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
Local file system. An attacker needs to be able to create symlinks on the local file system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must have local access to the file system and be able to create symlinks and have knowledge of the file names used by the vulnerable application. The Beego application needs to be running with root privileges for privilege escalation to be possible.
