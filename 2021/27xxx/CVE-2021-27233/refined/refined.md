- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Mutare Voice (EVM) web application's admin portal displays password information for external systems in cleartext. Specifically, the `Settings.asp` page is affected.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext storage of sensitive information (passwords), which violates the principle of least privilege and secure handling of credentials. This is related to CWE-316: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
- **Impact of exploitation:** An administrator user with access to the web portal can view external system passwords in cleartext, which could lead to unauthorized access to those external systems if the administrator's account is compromised or the administrator misuses their access.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to have administrator level access to the Mutare Voice (EVM) web application admin portal.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative credentials to the Mutare Voice (EVM) web portal.
