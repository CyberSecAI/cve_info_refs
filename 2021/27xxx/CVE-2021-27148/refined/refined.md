The provided content relates to CVE-2021-27148.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The HTTP server on FiberHome HG6245D routers contains a large number of hardcoded credentials.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Hardcoded credentials:** The `webs` binary contains hardcoded credentials for multiple ISPs, including username/password combinations like `user/user1234`, `f~i!b@e#r$h%o^m\*esuperadmin/s(f)u_h+g|u`, `admin/lnadmin`, `admin/CUadmin`, `admin/admin`, `telecomadmin/nE7jA%5m`, `adminpldt/z6dUABtl270qRxt7a2uGTiw`, and many others.
*   The credentials include a username 'admin' with a password generated from the last part of the br0 MAC address.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the device's web interface and potentially the CLI telnet, using the hardcoded credentials. This can lead to full control over the router.
*   The attacker can then use further exploits to gain a root shell on the device, as detailed in the document.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Web interface access:** The attacker can attempt to log in to the web interface (typically accessed via `https://<router_ip>/fh`) using the hardcoded credentials.
*  **CLI telnet Access:** After logging in via the web interface using hardcoded credentials, the attacker can enable the CLI telnet and gain access to a command shell.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface. This could be from the LAN or, due to the lack of IPv6 firewall rules, potentially from the WAN/Internet over IPv6.
*   The attacker needs to be aware of or be able to discover the specific IP address of the router.
