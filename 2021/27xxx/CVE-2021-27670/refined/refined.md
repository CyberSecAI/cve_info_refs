The provided content describes a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application's proxy functionality allows an attacker to control the URL to which the server makes a request. Specifically, the `/api/v1/core/proxy/jsonprequest` endpoint is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper input validation on the `url` parameter.
- The application fetches a resource based on a user-supplied URL without sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gather information about ports and IP addresses.
- The vulnerability allows access to internal systems behind a web application firewall (WAF), which are normally unreachable from the external network.
- It can be used to discover the IP addresses of servers running behind a reverse proxy.
- The attacker can potentially perform Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Attack vectors:**
- By manipulating the `url` parameter in the request to `/api/v1/core/proxy/jsonprequest`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application's endpoint.
- The attacker can be external to the network hosting the application.
