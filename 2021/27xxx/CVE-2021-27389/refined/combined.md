SSA-788287: Disclosure of Private Data

2021-04-13
Publication Date:

Last Update:
V1.0
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 10.0

SUMMARY

Due to SmartClient Installation technology (ClickOnce) a customer/integrator needs to create a customer
speciﬁc Smartclient installer. The mentioned products delivered a trusted but yet expired codesigning
certiﬁcate.

An attacker could have exploited the vulnerability by spooﬁng the code-signing certiﬁcate and signing a
malicious executable resulting in having a trusted digital signature from a trusted provider.

The certiﬁcate was revoked immediately.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Explicitly distrust the certiﬁcate with the ﬁngerprint FA:53:A4:74:FC:1E:16:6F:E6:6A:D2:5A:C1:E6:

8B:B1:91:CB:38:E9:85:7E:07:79:C1:A5:C3:59:1A:5A:04:96

• The certiﬁcate expired on 7th March 2021 and was not renewed.

• Make sure to use correct Certiﬁcate validation (CRL / OSCP) when validating certiﬁcates.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

charts, statistics, quality gates) can detect production errors to avoid further processing and shipment of
nonconforming material.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-27389

A private sign key is shipped with the product without adequate protection.
