- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A private code-signing key was shipped with the product without adequate protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hard-coded cryptographic key (CWE-321), use of an expired code-signing certificate.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could spoof the code-signing certificate, sign a malicious executable, and make it appear to be trusted. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine, as the attacker could create a malicious installer, trusted by the user. The advisory also mentions the possibility of disclosure of private data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to create a malicious executable and sign it with a spoofed certificate based on the leaked private key.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need the leaked private key in order to successfully exploit the vulnerability.
