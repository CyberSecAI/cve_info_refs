- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web interface of the Sercomm AGCOMBO VD625-Smart Modem does not properly sanitize the input provided in the URL, specifically when processing download requests. It takes the provided URL and places it directly into the "Content-Disposition" header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CRLF Injection. The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject CRLF characters (`\r\n` or `%0d%0a`) into the "Content-Disposition" header field. This injection enables the attacker to insert arbitrary headers in the HTTP response.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
  -  The attacker can inject malicious headers, potentially leading to system compromise.
  -  The vulnerability can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if an attacker manages to inject a malicious script.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted GET request to the web server, including CRLF characters and arbitrary HTTP header fields within the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web interface of the vulnerable Sercomm device.
