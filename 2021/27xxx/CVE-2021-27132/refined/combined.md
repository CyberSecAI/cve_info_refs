* ## [CRLF Injection – Sercomm VD625 CVE-2021-27132](https://cybertuz.com/crlf-injection-sercomm-vd625-cve-2021-27132/)

  An issue was discovered in **Sercomm AGCOMBO VD625-Smart Modem** – Firmware version: **AGSOT\_2.1.0**, there is a **CRLF Injection** vulnerability via the header field “**Content-Disposition**“.

  The Sercomm AGCOMBO VD625-Smart Modem is a **CPE** (Customer-premises equipment) made by Sercomm for the various **ISPs** (Internet service providers). The device in which the vulnerability was found is the one for **TIM** (Telecom Italia).

  The vulnerability described below refers specifically to the firmware version: **AGSOT\_2.1.0** in the image below there are complete information of the device where the vulnerability was found.

  The device expose a **web interface** for management, it is possible to create a modified http request to the web server, just putting a .txt or other type of extension in the url of **GET** request, the device thinks it is a download request. Then the system takes the contents of the url that we insert and puts it in the header field “**Content-Disposition**” and the system will try to download this file.

  This header field is not properly sanitized, so it is possible to use the **CRLF technique(\r\n)** to force the header to wrap by inserting a new line and then insert other header fields as desired in the http response.

  As we can see in the image, we were able to inject the **CRLFInjection cookie** using the CRLF technique (encoding the values \r\n with %0d%0a) in the GET request with the url test.txt. In short, the system takes the url as input and puts it in the “**Content-Disposition**” field and it tries to download the selected “file”, but when it finds the **CRLF field** it wraps the header and adds other header fields that we have **concatenated** in the url.

  While it does not appear to be a serious impact on the system, theoretically a possible attacker could find a way to use it to **compromise the system** by loading malicious code or it could even lead to an **XSS**.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Program has assigned the ID CVE-2021-27132 to this issue. This is a record on the [CVE List](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/), which standardizes names for security problems.
