Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-27224

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the WPG.dll plugin for IrfanView during the parsing of WPG files. This occurs due to an incorrect calculation within the `sub_7C42E78` function when writing to memory based on the provided file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The code attempts to write to a memory location outside the allocated buffer, leading to a crash and potential for exploitation. This occurs because of flawed logic in how the memory write is calculated. Specifically in the function `sub_7C42E78`, based on a value at address `a2-10`, a byte is written at the address calculated by `*(_DWORD *)(a2 - 20) + *(_DWORD *)(a2 - 28) / ... + *(_DWORD *)(a2 - 24) * *(_DWORD *)(a2 - 4)`. In all cases inside the `switch` statement, the value pointed to by `*(_DWORD *)(a2 - 28)` is not properly checked against the size of the buffer at `*(_DWORD *)(a2 - 20)`, leading to out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds write can lead to a crash of the application due to memory corruption.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potential):** While the provided information does not explicitly confirm arbitrary code execution, the out-of-bounds write vulnerability has the potential to be exploited for arbitrary code execution in a worst-case scenario. This is because an attacker might be able to overwrite critical data or code in memory and gain control over the program flow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File-based exploitation:** An attacker can craft a malicious WPG file that, when opened using a vulnerable version of IrfanView, triggers the out-of-bounds write.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious WPG file.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the crafted WPG file using a vulnerable version of IrfanView.
- No specific network access or special privileges are required for exploitation; it's primarily a local attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found through fuzzing the `WPG.DLL` library.
- The provided assembly code snippets help identify the vulnerable points in the code.
- The issue is located within the `sub_7C42E78` and `sub_7C4326C` functions.
- The vulnerability exists in the way the code calculates the memory address for writing.
- The issue is present in all cases of the switch statement in the identified function.
- The `!exploitable` debugger output confirms that the vulnerability is exploitable with a "User Mode Write AV" classification.
