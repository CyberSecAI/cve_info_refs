Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-27408:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the affected Hillrom products.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125): This allows an attacker to read data from memory locations outside the intended buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Information leakage: The out-of-bounds read can leak sensitive information.
*   Arbitrary code execution: When chained with an out-of-bounds write vulnerability (CVE-2021-27410), an attacker can potentially achieve arbitrary code execution.
*   Memory corruption: Exploitation can lead to memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Network-based: The advisory states that the vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
*   Adjacent Network: CVSS vector indicates the attack vector is adjacent network

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be on the adjacent network and have low privileges on the target system.
*   The attack complexity is high, meaning the exploitation might require specific conditions or crafted payloads.
