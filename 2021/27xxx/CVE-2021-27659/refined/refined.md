*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
    *   The attack complexity is low (AC:L).
    *   No privileges are required for the attack (PR:N).
    *   No user interaction is required (UI:N).
    *   The scope is unchanged (S:U), indicating that the vulnerability is exploitable within the application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
