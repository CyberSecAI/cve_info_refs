| Description The `gnrc_rpl_validation_options` function has a problem very similar to the one described in [#16018](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/issues/16018): It casts packed structs without performing a prior bounds check. For example, consider the handler for `GNRC_RPL_OPT_PAD1`:     [RIOT/sys/net/gnrc/routing/rpl/gnrc\_rpl\_validation.c](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/922e2ac1c9046d0bd6ef46c3ce50766751550f17/sys/net/gnrc/routing/rpl/gnrc_rpl_validation.c#L37-L40)  Lines 37 to 40 in [922e2ac](/RIOT-OS/RIOT/commit/922e2ac1c9046d0bd6ef46c3ce50766751550f17)   |  | case (GNRC\_RPL\_OPT\_PAD1): | | --- | --- | |  | expected\_len += 1; | |  | opt = (gnrc\_rpl\_opt\_t \*) (((uint8\_t \*) opt) + 1); | |  | continue; |      This is missing a check ala.:  ``` if (len < sizeof(gnrc_rpl_opt_t))   return false; ```  Otherwise, reading `opt->length` (or `opt->type` on the next iteration) may result in an out-of-bounds read:     [RIOT/sys/net/gnrc/routing/rpl/gnrc\_rpl\_validation.c](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/922e2ac1c9046d0bd6ef46c3ce50766751550f17/sys/net/gnrc/routing/rpl/gnrc_rpl_validation.c#L103)  Line 103 in [922e2ac](/RIOT-OS/RIOT/commit/922e2ac1c9046d0bd6ef46c3ce50766751550f17)   |  | expected\_len += opt->length + sizeof(gnrc\_rpl\_opt\_t); | | --- | --- |     Steps to reproduce the issue Use `examples/gnrc_networking`, activate `gnrc_pktbuf_malloc` and set `CONFIG_GNRC_RPL_DEFAULT_NETIF` to your netif (check with `ifconfig` in the shell provided by `gnrc_networking`) mine is `6`:  ``` diff --git a/examples/gnrc_networking/Makefile b/examples/gnrc_networking/Makefile index bf76931305..15132894c1 100644 --- a/examples/gnrc_networking/Makefile +++ b/examples/gnrc_networking/Makefile @@ -31,6 +31,9 @@ USEMODULE += netstats_l2  USEMODULE += netstats_ipv6  USEMODULE += netstats_rpl   +USEMODULE += gnrc_pktbuf_malloc +CFLAGS += -DCONFIG_GNRC_RPL_DEFAULT_NETIF=6 +  # Optionally include DNS support.
