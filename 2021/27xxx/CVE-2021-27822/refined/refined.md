{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the 'catename' parameter when adding a category, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they view the category, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects a malicious payload into the 'catename' field when adding a category through the web interface. The payload is stored in the database and is executed when the category is viewed.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator to access the 'Manage Category' feature and submit a crafted payload."
