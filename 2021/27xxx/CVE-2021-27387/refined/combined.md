SSA-133038: Multiple Modfem File Parsing Vulnerabilities in
Simcenter Femap

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

SUMMARY

Siemens Simcenter Femap is affected by two vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the application
reads modfem ﬁles. If a user is tricked to open a malicious ﬁle with the affected application, this could lead
to a crash, and potentially also to arbitrary code execution or data extraction on the target host system.

Siemens has released updates for Simcenter Femap and recommends to update to the latest version to
ﬁx the vulnerabilities. Siemens recommends to avoid opening of untrusted ﬁles from unknown sources.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Do not open untrusted modfem ﬁles from unknown sources

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Simcenter Femap is an advanced simulation application for creating, editing, and inspecting ﬁnite element
models of complex products or systems.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s

environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-27387

The femap.exe application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing FEMAP ﬁles.
This could result in an out of bounds write past the end of an allocated structure, a different vulnerability
than CVE-2021-27399.

An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.

## Siemens Simcenter Femap modfem File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-21-780ZDI-CAN-12819

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-27387](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-27387) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | Siemens |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Simcenter Femap |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Siemens Simcenter Femap. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of modfem files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated data structure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |
