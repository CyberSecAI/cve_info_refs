- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the DataGridService WCF service, leading to the deserialization of untrusted data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Deserialization of untrusted data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code within the context of an Administrator.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attackers must first have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low-privileged code execution capabilities on the target system.
