- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The PerFact OpenVPN-Client allows external control of system or configuration settings. Specifically, an attacker can send a configuration command from any application on the local host to force the back-end server to initialize a new OpenVPN instance with an arbitrary OpenVPN configuration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** External control of system or configuration settings (CWE-15).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to local privilege escalation or remote code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to gain SYSTEM user privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious webpage could be used to deliver the attack, or any local application could send a crafted configuration command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to execute an application on the local machine or trick the user into accessing a malicious webpage. The CVSS score indicates that a low-skilled attacker can leverage this vulnerability remotely if the machine is exposed to the network.
