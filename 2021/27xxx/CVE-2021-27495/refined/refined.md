- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Ypsomed mylife Cloud reflects the user password during the login process after redirecting the user from an HTTPS endpoint to an HTTP endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficiently protected credentials (CWE-522). The password is leaked by transitioning from a secure HTTPS connection to an insecure HTTP connection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could obtain sensitive user credentials (password). An attacker could also potentially modify the integrity of data being transmitted.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based. An attacker intercepts network traffic when the user is redirected from HTTPS to HTTP during login.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic, such as a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. The attacker must be a low-privileged user and the user must take action (UI:R) for the exploit to take place.
