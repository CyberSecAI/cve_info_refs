- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect buffer length checks in `rand_core::le::read_u32_into` and `rand_core::le::read_u64_into` functions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The functions fail to properly validate the length of the source buffer during the seeding process. This results in under-filling of the destination buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Downstream RNGs, like `Hc128Rng`, that use these functions for seeding can be initialized with insufficient seed material, leading to predictable or weak random number generation. This could compromise cryptographic security if the RNG is used in security-sensitive contexts.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by providing an insufficiently sized buffer during the seeding process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No special privileges or user interaction is needed to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs the ability to control the seed data passed to the affected functions.

The advisory notes that `ChaCha*Rng` is not vulnerable, but `Hc128Rng` is.
