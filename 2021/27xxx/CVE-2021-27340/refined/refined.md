The commit diff shows changes in the AuthCryp.php file, which is related to an encryption function. The release notes and issue discussion mention security fixes in openSIS, but there are no details regarding the specific vulnerabilities or their root causes.",

    "impact": "Reflected XSS could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser. Local file inclusion could allow an attacker to read sensitive files from the server. The mentioned commit also introduces modifications to an encryption function (AuthCryp.php). Insecure encryption could potentially compromise user data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Reflected XSS: Attacker crafts a malicious URL, tricking a user into clicking it, and executing JavaScript in the user's browser.",

      "For XSS, the attacker would need to be able to craft URLs and trick users into clicking them.",
      "For LFI, the attacker would need to be able to manipulate URL parameters or application inputs.",
      "For weak encryption the attacker would need access to the database."
