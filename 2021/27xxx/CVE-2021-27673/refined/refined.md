Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27673:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `cID` parameter in the `admin_boxes.ajax.php` file of the Zenario CMS is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input within the `cID` parameter before reflecting it back to the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `cID` parameter. When a victim (an authenticated admin user in this case) visits the crafted URL, the malicious script will execute in their browser.
*   This can lead to a variety of attacks, such as:
    *   Session hijacking: Stealing the victim's session cookies to gain unauthorized access to their account.
    *   Defacement: Modifying the appearance of the web page the user is viewing.
    *   Phishing: Redirecting the user to a fake login page to steal their credentials.
    *   Malware distribution: Redirecting the user to a page that downloads and installs malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL with a malicious script in the `cID` parameter.
*   The victim needs to be an authenticated user and access the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload in the `cID` parameter.
*   The attacker needs to trick an authenticated administrator user into visiting the malicious URL.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was found in Zenario CMS version 8.8.52729.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 8.8.53370.
*   The report mentions that the same `cID` parameter is also vulnerable to Blind & Error based SQL injection (CVE-2021â€“27672).
