## NETGEAR Multiple Routers SSDP Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-21-206ZDI-CAN-11851

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-27239](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-27239) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 8.8, [AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [NETGEAR](https://www.netgear.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Multiple Routers |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NETGEAR R6400 and R6700 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the upnpd service, which listens on UDP port 1900 by default. A crafted MX header field in an SSDP message can trigger an overflow of a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. |

**Note:** NETGEAR released multiple hardware versions of some of the affected products. A hardware version is denoted by “v” and a number following the product model. For example, R6700v3 is a different product from R6700v2. If a model number does not have a hardware version number after it, then it is hardware version 1. R6700 means the same thing as R6700v1. If you’re not sure what model you have, check the label on the back or bottom of your NETGEAR product.

NETGEAR strongly recommends that you download the latest firmware fixes as soon as possible. Firmware fixes are currently available for all affected products.

**To download the latest firmware for your NETGEAR product:**

1. Visit [NETGEAR Support](https://www.netgear.com/support/).
2. Start typing your model number in the search box, then select your model from the drop-down menu as soon as it appears.

   If you do not see a drop-down menu, make sure that you entered your model number correctly, or select a product category to browse for your product model.
3. Click **Downloads**.
4. Under **Current Versions**, select the first download whose title begins with **Firmware Version**.
5. Click **Release Notes**.
6. Follow the instructions in the firmware release notes to download and install the new firmware.

### Best Practices for Updating Firmware

We recommend that you keep your NETGEAR devices up to date with the latest firmware. Firmware updates contain security fixes, bug fixes, and new features for your NETGEAR products.

If your product is supported by one of our apps, using the app is the easiest way to update your firmware:

* Orbi products: NETGEAR Orbi app
* NETGEAR WiFi routers: NETGEAR Nighthawk app
* Some NETGEAR Business products: NETGEAR Insight app (firmware updates through the app are available only for Insight subscribers)

If your product is not supported by one of our apps, you can always update your firmware manually by following the instructions in your product’s user manual, firmware release notes, or product support page. For more information, see [Where can I find information about my NETGEAR product?](https://kb.netgear.com/000060613/Where-can-I-find-information-about-my-NETGEAR-product).

### Contact
