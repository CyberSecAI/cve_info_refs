- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient sanitization/filtering of input parameters in the bounce management callback function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code which will be executed when an authenticated user views the details page of an affected lead. This can lead to information theft or tampering.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack. The attacker sends a POST request to the bounce management callback endpoint with malicious JavaScript in the "error" and "error_related_to" parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Access to the bounce management callback function.
    - Ability to craft POST requests to the specific endpoint (/mailer/<product / webhook>/callback).
    - No authentication is needed to access this endpoint.
    - A Mautic user needs to view the details page of the lead where the XSS payload is stored.
