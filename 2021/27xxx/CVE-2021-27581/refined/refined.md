Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2021-27581:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to **unsafe incorporation of user-controllable data into database SQL queries** within the blog module of Kentico CMS 5.5 R2 (build 5.5.3996). Specifically, the "tagname" parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to sanitize or parameterize user-supplied input ("tagname"), allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query. This leads to a Time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the backend database.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** Attackers can modify or delete stored data within the database.
*   **Interference with application logic**: Attackers can inject SQL code that can alter the intended behavior of the application
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers may escalate their privileges within the database.
*   **Potential Database Server Takeover:** If specific conditions are met, an attacker could potentially gain control of the underlying operating system hosting the Kentico CMS.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request targeting the `/blog` endpoint, by manipulating the `tagname` parameter.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The specific vulnerable parameter is "tagname".

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected Kentico CMS instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring prior authentication to the application.
*  **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** Attacker needs to know which parameter is vulnerable to SQL Injection
* **Ability to send crafted requests**: Attacker needs to have the ability to craft HTTP requests containing malicious SQL injection payloads.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability was discovered by Obrela LABS team and they informed the vendor prior to public disclosure.
*  The vulnerability was exploited using the `sqlmap` tool.
* A sample payload is provided in the content: `tagname=test'+(SELECT CHAR(118)+CHAR(103)+CHAR(85)+CHAR(89) WHERE 1718=1718 AND 6176=(SELECT COUNT(\*) FROM sysusers AS sys1,sysusers AS sys2,sysusers AS sys3,sysusers AS sys4,sysusers AS sys5,sysusers AS sys6,sysusers AS sys7))+'&groupid=1`

This information provides a good understanding of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and the necessary conditions for exploitation.
