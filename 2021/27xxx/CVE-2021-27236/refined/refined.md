- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `getfile.asp` script in Mutare Voice (EVM) allows for unauthenticated local file inclusion due to a parameter that can be manipulated to view arbitrary file contents.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Unauthenticated local file inclusion vulnerability.
  - Source code disclosure.
  - Potential for server-side file dumping.
  - Possibility of escalating to Remote Code Execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - Complete control over the server.
  - Exposure of sensitive information through source code disclosure.
  - Ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - Manipulating the parameter of the `getfile.asp` script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - Unauthenticated access to the Mutare Voice (EVM) web application.
