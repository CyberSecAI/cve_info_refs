- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Vault's Cassandra integrations did not validate TLS certificates when connecting to Cassandra clusters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of TLS certificate validation, leading to insecure connections.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Vault may connect to untrusted Cassandra clusters, potentially exposing sensitive data or allowing man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could potentially impersonate a Cassandra server by presenting a malicious certificate.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or control the communication between the Vault server and the Cassandra cluster, and present a fraudulent certificate.
