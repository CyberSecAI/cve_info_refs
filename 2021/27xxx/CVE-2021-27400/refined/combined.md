**Bulletin ID:** HCSEC-2021-10

**Affected Products / Versions:** Vault and Vault Enterprise; fixed in 1.6.4 and 1.7.1.

**Publication Date:** April 21, 2021

**Summary**

Vault and Vault Enterprise (“Vault”) Cassandra integrations, a Vault storage backend and database secrets engine plugin, did not validate TLS certificates when connecting to Cassandra clusters. This vulnerability, CVE-2021-27400, was fixed in Vault and Vault Enterprise 1.6.4 and 1.7.1.

**Background**

Vault integrates with Apache Cassandra, an open-source NoSQL database, in two ways. The [Cassandra storage backend](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration/storage/cassandra) is used to persist Vault’s data in a Cassandra cluster, and the [Cassandra database secrets engine plugin](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/databases/cassandra) allows dynamic generation of database credentials based on configured roles for the Cassandra database.

**Details**

Vault’s Cassandra integrations did not have TLS certificate validation enabled for connections to Cassandra clusters. As a result, Vault may have connected to Cassandra clusters without adequately verifying the trustworthiness of the remote service and connection.

**Remediation**

Customers using the Vault Cassandra integrations should evaluate the risk associated with this issue, and consider upgrading to Vault Enterprise 1.6.4 / 1.7.1 or newer. Please refer to [Upgrading Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/upgrading) for general guidance and version-specific upgrade notes.

This issue was identified by Martin Sucha who reported it to HashiCorp.
