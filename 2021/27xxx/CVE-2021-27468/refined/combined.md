### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Sharon Brizinov and Amir Preminger of Claroty reported these vulnerabilities to Rockwell Automation.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Rockwell Automation encourages users of the affected versions of FactoryTalk AssetCentre to update to AssetCentre v11 (or above) to addresses these vulnerabilities.  For more information about these vulnerabilities and mitigations please see Rockwell Automation’s publication [KnowledgeBase ID: PN1559](https://idp.rockwellautomation.com/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.aspx?RelayState=RPID%3Drockwellautomation.custhelp.com%26RelayState%3Danswers%2Fanswer_view%2Fa_id%2F1130831)

As an additional mitigation, Rockwell Automation encourages users who are unable to upgrade or are concerned about unauthorized client connections to use built in security features found within FactoryTalk AssetCentre. Users should follow guidance found in [QA46277](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1090456). IPsec would minimize exposure to unauthorized clients and has been tested in FactoryTalk AssetCentre v9-v11

Rockwell Automation recommends the following software/PC-based mitigation strategies:

* Run all software as User, not as an Administrator, to minimize the impact of malicious code on the infected system.
* Use of Microsoft AppLocker or other similar allow list applications can help mitigate risk. Information on using AppLocker with Rockwell Automation products is available at [Knowledge Base Article QA17329](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/546989)
* Ensure the least-privilege user principle is followed, and user/service account access to shared resources (such as a database) is only granted with a minimum number of rights as needed.

Rockwell Automation recommends the following general mitigations:

* Use trusted software, software patches, antivirus/antimalware programs and interact only with trusted web sites and attachments.
* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet. For further information about the risks of unprotected Internet accessible control systems, please see [Knowledgebase Article PN715](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/494865)
* Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize a VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
