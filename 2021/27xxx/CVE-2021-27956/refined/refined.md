Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-27956:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization/escaping of user-controlled data within the "email" field when displaying user search results in ManageEngine AD Self Service Plus. Specifically, HTML content is not escaped when the "More" tab is clicked after a user search.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the "email" field of an Active Directory user object. This script is then stored in the Active Directory and reflected back to users when the user is searched in the application and the "More" tab is clicked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session, potentially leading to:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies to gain unauthorized access to the application.
    - **Data Theft:** Extracting sensitive information displayed on the page or performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - **Phishing:** Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    - **Defacement:** Altering the visual appearance of the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Field Injection:** The attacker needs to modify an Active Directory user's email field to include malicious JavaScript. This could be done through several means, potentially including compromising an account with the ability to make those changes in Active Directory.
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered through the ManageEngine AD Self Service Plus web interface when a user performs a search and clicks the "More" tab for a malicious user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to modify an Active Directory user's email field.
- The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit the vulnerability other than being a user of the vulnerable system. The exploit is triggered when the search results are loaded, not when the malicious data is input.
- The attacker needs to entice a user to search for the malicious Active Directory user within the web application and click the "More" tab on the results.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered in ManageEngine AD Self Service Plus Version 6.1, build 6100.
- A patch is available in Build Version 6104.
- The vulnerability was reported to Zoho on February 19, 2021, and a patch was released on May 8, 2021.
