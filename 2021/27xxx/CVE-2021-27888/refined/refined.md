This likely refers to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. While not directly stating it is CVE-2021-27888, it could be related.

**Vulnerability Details (based on the XSS fix in 6.06-4 Beta):**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of filenames containing potentially malicious characters when displaying drop-offs.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the page that displays the drop-off, which could lead to various issues such as:
    *   Stealing cookies.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker crafts a filename with malicious characters (e.g., `<script>`).
    *   The attacker uploads the file using the ZendTo service.
    *   When a user views the drop-off containing the malicious filename, the XSS payload is triggered.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the ZendTo service.
    *   The attacker does not need any special privileges on the ZendTo system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The changelog entry is brief, and doesn't offer detailed technical information about the vulnerability.
*   The description suggests the vulnerability is related to how the ZendTo application handles file names with unusual or malicious characters, and how it renders those names on the web interface.
*   It is possible that this change fixed an existing XSS vulnerability that was assigned the CVE number CVE-2021-27888.
