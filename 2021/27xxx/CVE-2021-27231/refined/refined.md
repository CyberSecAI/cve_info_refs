Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-27231:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Insufficient validation of root domain ownership:** The Hestia Control Panel (HestiaCP) does not properly validate if a user attempting to create a subdomain actually owns the root domain. This allows users to create subdomains for domains owned by other users on the same server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Privilege Management:** Authenticated users can create domain aliases (nginx vhosts) for subdomains belonging to other users within the same shared hosting environment.
*   **Subdomain Takeover:** Attackers can perform subdomain takeovers by creating aliases for mail domains, effectively redirecting email traffic (IMAP/POP requests) to their own accounts.
*   **Lack of Validation:** The "Add Web Domain" functionality lacks proper checks to prevent users from creating subdomains of domains they don't own.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Email Account Takeover:** Attackers can gain access to other users' email accounts by redirecting mail traffic to their own server and potentially stealing credentials upon login.
*   **Phishing:** Attackers can create webmail portals for stolen domains, allowing them to phish credentials from legitimate users.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Users can effectively be denied access to their email accounts, as their incoming emails are redirected to an attacker-controlled system.
*   **Data Theft:** The attacker can gain access to the user's emails.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be a registered user on the shared hosting platform to create a subdomain of someone else's root domain.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited via the "Add Web Domain" function in the HestiaCP web interface.
*   **Shared Hosting Environment:** The vulnerability is specific to shared hosting setups where multiple users are on the same server with the same DNS server for their domains.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **HestiaCP User Account:** The attacker needs to have an active user account on the HestiaCP instance.
*   **Same Shared Hosting Server:** The attacker must be on the same HestiaCP server as the victim user.
*   **Shared DNS Server:** The victim's domain must be using the same DNS server as the attacker, hosted by the HestiaCP server itself.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is not exploitable if BIND9 is not used.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by lack of validation within the "Add Web Domain" feature when a user creates a subdomain of an existing domain.
*   The fix involved using an up-to-date list of public suffixes to validate domain ownership and implemented an option to disable the security check on a per domain basis.
