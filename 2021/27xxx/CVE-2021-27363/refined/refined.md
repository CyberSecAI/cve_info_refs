Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-27363:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The iSCSI initiator subsystem in the Linux kernel exposes the transport handle via sysfs without proper access restrictions. This allows any local user to read the transport handle, which is a kernel pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leak:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of a kernel pointer through sysfs to unprivileged users. This violates the principle of least privilege and leaks kernel memory layout information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leak:** The direct impact is an information leak.
- **Facilitates Further Exploitation:** This leak of the kernel pointer, specifically to the `iscsi_transport` structure, provides a KASLR bypass and can be used to facilitate exploitation of other vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2021-27364 and CVE-2021-27365).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by any local user who can access the sysfs file system.
- **Sysfs:** The vulnerability is triggered through reading a specific sysfs entry: `/sys/class/iscsi_transport/$TRANSPORT_NAME/handle`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Access:** The attacker must have a local user account on the affected system.
- **No Elevated Privileges Required:** No special privileges (like root) are required to read the vulnerable sysfs file.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is in the `show_transport_handle()` function within `drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c`.
- The function directly returns the `iscsi_transport` pointer as a string representation without any permission checks:
  ```c
  show_transport_handle(struct device *dev, struct device_attribute *attr, char *buf) {
    struct iscsi_internal *priv = dev_to_iscsi_internal(dev);
    return sprintf(buf, "%llu\n", (unsigned long long)iscsi_handle(priv->iscsi_transport));
  }
  ```
- The fix involves adding a capability check (`capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN)`) to restrict access to the handle only to users with administrative privileges.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is often mentioned in conjunction with CVE-2021-27364 as they are related and can be chained for more significant exploits.
- The vulnerability was present since the initial introduction of open-iscsi and affects multiple versions of the Linux kernel and various Linux distributions.
- The transport handle being exposed is used by the `iscsid` daemon, and this was the intended functionality initially, however, no access restrictions were in place.
