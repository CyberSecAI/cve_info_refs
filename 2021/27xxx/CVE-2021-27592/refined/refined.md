Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the parsing of U3D files by SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer.
- The core issue is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during U3D file processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The insufficient validation of user-supplied data leads to a write operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated data structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running the SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious U3D file: The attacker can craft a malicious U3D file containing specially crafted data.
- User interaction required: The victim must either open this malicious U3D file or visit a malicious page that triggers the processing of the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious U3D file to the victim. This could be via email, file sharing, or a compromised website.
- No special privileges are required on the victim's system.
- The attacker does not need to be on the local network.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer 9.0 FP10 MP2.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on different dates according to different ZDI advisories (2020-12-16 and 2021-01-13)
