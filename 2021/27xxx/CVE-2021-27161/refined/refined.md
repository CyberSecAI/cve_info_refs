Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-27161:

**CVE-2021-27161:** This CVE is associated with a hardcoded credential within the HTTP server of FiberHome HG6245D routers.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of hardcoded credentials directly within the web server's binary (`webs`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The web server binary contains a variety of hardcoded usernames and passwords for different ISPs. One specific credential listed is `admin` / `getOnuMac(s, 6, 32)` (where the password is the last part of the MAC address of the `br0` interface).
*   **Multiple Credentials:** The document details other hardcoded credentials, but focuses on the one specifically for this CVE.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can utilize these hardcoded credentials to gain access to the web administration interface (`https://ip/fh`).
*   **CLI Telnet Access:** Successful login to the web interface using these credentials allows enabling the CLI telnet server on port 23/tcp.
*   **Potential RCE:** This is a step towards achieving Remote Code Execution (RCE) as the attacker could then exploit other vulnerabilities, such as the Linux telnetd which has hardcoded credentials itself or via the authentication bypass on the CLI telnet.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The attack vector involves accessing the web management interface of the router through its web portal using the hardcoded credentials.
*   **Network Access:** An attacker requires network access to the router. This can be from the LAN (local network) or, due to the lack of IPv6 firewall, potentially from the WAN (Internet) over IPv6.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to communicate with the router's web interface (HTTP/HTTPS).
*   **Credential Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know one of the hardcoded username/password combinations. For this specific CVE, the attacker would need to be able to derive the password via the function `getOnuMac` from the MAC address of the `br0` interface.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document emphasizes that these credentials are used with the `https://ip/fh` path to open access to the CLI telnet server.
*   The `getOnuMac` function extracts the last part of the MAC address, suggesting the password may be dynamically generated, but it's still a hardcoded behavior that can be exploited.
* The document includes code snippets, screenshots and reverse-engineered code to highlight where the credentials and functionality exist.
* The document explicitly states that full disclosure is applied due to the belief that backdoors have been intentionally placed by the vendor.
