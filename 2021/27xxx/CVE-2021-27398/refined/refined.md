Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing SPP files within the `PlantSimCore.dll` library. Specifically, the length of user-supplied data is not checked before being copied to a stack-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121):** The primary weakness is a stack-based buffer overflow. By providing a crafted SPP file with excessive data, an attacker can overflow the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, effectively taking control of the application.
*   **Application Crash:** The vulnerability can also lead to application crashes, denying service to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious SPP Files:** The primary attack vector is through malicious SPP files. An attacker crafts a malicious SPP file and tricks a user into opening it using the vulnerable application.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction because the target user has to open a malicious file with the affected application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafted SPP File:** The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted SPP file containing excessive data designed to trigger the overflow.
*   **Social Engineering:** Some level of social engineering is required to convince a user to open the malicious SPP file.
*   **Local Access**: The attack is classified as a local attack (AV:L) which likely means that an attacker needs to have a way to get the malicious file to the target.

**Additional details from ZDI:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2021-03-10.
*   The advisory was released publicly on 2021-05-13.
*   The ZDI assigned this vulnerability the identifier ZDI-21-570 and ZDI-CAN-13290.
