Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-27847:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a division-by-zero error in two functions within the `libvips` library:
    *   `vips_eye_point` in `eye.c#L83`
    *   `vips_mask_point` in `mask.c#L85`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Division-by-Zero:** The code lacks proper checks to ensure that the divisors in the division operations within the affected functions are not zero.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Availability:** A division-by-zero error can cause a program to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition by impacting the availability of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based, implying that an attacker could trigger the vulnerability through network requests/interaction with the application/service using the affected library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Attack Complexity**: The vulnerability is easily exploitable.
*   **No Privileges Required**: The attacker does not need any specific privileges to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction Required**: User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability, implying that the attacker needs to induce an action from a user to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was reported in `libvips` issue #1236.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in `libvips` version 8.8.0 and is present in version 8.7.4 and earlier.
* The CVSS score is 6.5 (Moderate) with the following vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
