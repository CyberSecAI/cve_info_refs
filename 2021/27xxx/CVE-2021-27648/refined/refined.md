- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an externally controlled reference to a resource in another sphere within the quarantine functionality of Synology Antivirus Essential.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper access control/privilege management. The software allows an authenticated user to influence resource access in a different security domain, thus bypassing intended isolation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit allows a remote authenticated user to gain elevated privileges on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is described as unspecified but involves the quarantine functionality and an externally controlled resource. This suggests a user can potentially manipulate the quarantine process to access or execute resources outside the intended sandbox or security context.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user with the ability to interact with the vulnerable quarantine functionality. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
