The provided content describes a vulnerability in Vizio Smart TVs, specifically the 2017 E50x-E1 model, though other models like the 2018 P65-F1 are also mentioned. This vulnerability allows for unauthenticated remote code execution.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Vizio TV API, which is intended for control through a mobile web application, allows unauthenticated developer commands. This includes the ability to upload and execute a binary file. Additionally, the API has an open cross-origin-resource-sharing (CORS) policy.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated API access: The API does not require authentication to execute developer commands.
- Command injection: The API allows for the upload and execution of arbitrary binary files.
- Open CORS policy: The API's open CORS policy makes it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- OS-level command execution: Attackers can achieve command execution on the TV's operating system.
- Persistence: Attackers can maintain persistence on the compromised TV.
- Lateral movement: A compromised TV can be used to attack other devices on the same network.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based: An attacker on the same local network (Wi-Fi or LAN) or the internet can send unauthenticated commands to the Vizio TV API.
- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery): A malicious CSRF request can be crafted and sent to a victim on the same network as the TV, resulting in exploitation when the victim interacts with the malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local Network Access: For network-based attacks, the attacker needs to be on the same network as the Vizio TV or the TV needs to be accessible over the internet.
- User Interaction: CSRF-based attacks require a victim on the same network to click a malicious link.
