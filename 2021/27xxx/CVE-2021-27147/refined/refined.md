Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-27147:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of CVE-2021-27147 is the presence of hardcoded credentials within the web server component (`webs` binary) of FiberHome HG6245D routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The web server contains numerous hardcoded usernames and passwords, including those for admin-level access, for different ISPs and internal usage. A specific username is `admin`, while passwords vary such as `lnadmin`, `CUadmin`, `admin`, `nE7jA%5m`, `z6dUABtl270qRxt7a2uGTiw` , `t3l3buc4r4m4ng42013`, `m3tr0r00t`, `fibre@dm!n`, `admintrue`, `G0R2U1P2ag`, `3UJUh2VemEfUtesEchEC2d2e`, `getOnuMac(s, 6, 32)`(last part of the MAC address of the `br0` interface), `888888`, `1234`, `tattoo@home`, `tele1234`, `aisadmin` etc.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can use these hardcoded credentials to gain unauthorized access to the router's web management interface.
*   **Configuration Changes:** Successful login allows attackers to modify router settings and potentially compromise the device and the network it serves.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Access to the web interface may provide means to enable a telnet CLI which can be further exploited to gain root access via additional vulnerabilities.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Combination of the above with additional weaknesses may allow complete compromise of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The primary attack vector is via HTTP/HTTPS requests to the router's web interface on the LAN.
*   **IPv6 Exposure:** Due to the lack of IPv6 firewall, the web interface is also accessible from the WAN side using the assigned IPv6 address.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** Attackers need network connectivity to the router's web interface (either on the LAN or WAN via IPv6).
*   **Credential Knowledge:** Attackers need to know or guess valid hardcoded credentials to exploit this vulnerability. Since credentials are part of the firmware, an attacker has to extract it by reverse engineering or find a list of well-known passwords used by the vendor.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** Attacker needs to interact with the web interface to attempt login.
