The provided content is related to CVE-2021-27973.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization of the `language` parameter in the `admin.php?page=languages` endpoint. This lack of sanitization allows for SQL injection through the `language` parameter when activating a language.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL injection vulnerability. The application directly incorporates user-supplied data into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database server. This may lead to data leakage (retrieving user data, database schema, etc.), data modification (altering or deleting data), or even complete compromise of the database server depending on the database user privileges. In the provided examples, the attacker is able to retrieve the database user and version.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the web interface via a crafted HTTP request targeting `admin.php?page=languages` with a malicious payload in the `language` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator or a user with the ability to set the language, which is a relatively low privilege requirement in the context of the vulnerable application.
