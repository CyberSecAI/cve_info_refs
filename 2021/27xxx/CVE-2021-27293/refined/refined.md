  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2021-27293",
    "description": "RestSharp < 106.11.8-alpha.0.13 uses a regular expression which is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) when converting strings into DateTimes. If a server responds with a malicious string, the client using RestSharp will be stuck processing it for an exceedingly long time. Thus the remote server can trigger Denial of Service.",

    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-185",
      "CWE-697"
    ],
    "cvss_score": 7.5,
        "attack_vector": "Network",

        "integrity": "None",
        "availability": "High",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a poorly written regular expression `NewDateRegex` in the `RestSharp.Extensions.StringExtensions` class. The regex `new Regex(@\"newDate\\((-?\\d+)*\\)\")` contains nested repeats which can lead to catastrophic backtracking.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"
    ],
    "impact": "If a server sends a malicious string in a response, a client using RestSharp will be stuck processing it for a long time leading to a denial of service.  The complexity is exponential, meaning that increasing the length of the malicious string of digits by one makes the processing time take about twice as long.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "A remote server sending a crafted string in the response body to a client using RestSharp."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the response body of the server, where a DateTime is expected to be. No special privileges or user interaction is required.",
     "additional_details": [
       "The vulnerable regex is used by the `ParseJsonDate` function when deserializing JSON responses into classes with `DateTime` properties.",
        "The space between 'new' and 'Date' is required due to pre-processing in `ParseJsonDate` function which removes spaces from the input.",
       "The fix involves removing the asterisk from the regex which prevents the nested repeat and catastrophic backtracking."
