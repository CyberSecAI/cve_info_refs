- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PAR files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated structure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: By tricking a user into opening a malicious PAR file with the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious PAR file and convince a user to open it with the vulnerable application.
