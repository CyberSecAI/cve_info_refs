The title of the advisory is "CVE-2021-27003 X-Frame-Options Header Vulnerability in Clustered Data ONTAP". The advisory also includes the CVSS score and vector from the official CVE description, confirming the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the absence of the `X-Frame-Options` header in the HTTP responses of Clustered Data ONTAP. This header is designed to protect against clickjacking attacks by controlling whether the browser is allowed to render the page in a `<frame>`, `<iframe>` or `<object>`.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Missing `X-Frame-Options` header.
    *   The absence of this header makes the affected versions susceptible to clickjacking attacks.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a clickjacking attack. This type of attack tricks users into interacting with a malicious page element that is overlayed on a legitimate page, often leading to unintended actions such as unauthorized data disclosure.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
     *  A remote attacker could host a malicious web page that embeds a vulnerable page from Clustered Data ONTAP in an iframe, leveraging the missing `X-Frame-Options` header to conduct a clickjacking attack.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page.
    *   The attacker does not require any authentication or prior access to the target system.
    * The attack can be performed remotely from any location with network access to the targeted system.
