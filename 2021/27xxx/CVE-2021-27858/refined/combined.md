#### FatPipe Networks WARP 10.2.2 Authorization Bypass

Title: FatPipe Networks WARP 10.2.2 Authorization Bypass

Advisory ID: [ZSL-2021-5682](ZSL-2021-5682.php)

Type: Local/Remote

Impact: Security Bypass

Risk: (3/5)

Release Date: 27.09.2021
##### Summary

FatPipe Networks invented the concept of router-clustering,
which provides the highest level of reliability, redundancy, and speed
of Internet traffic for Business Continuity and communications. FatPipe
WARP achieves fault tolerance for companies by creating an easy method
of combining two or more Internet connections of any kind over multiple
ISPs. FatPipe utilizes all paths when the lines are up and running,
dynamically balancing traffic over the multiple lines, and intelligently
failing over inbound and outbound IP traffic when ISP services and/or
components fail.
##### Description

Improper access control occurs when the application provides direct
access to objects based on user-supplied input. As a result of this vulnerability
attackers can bypass authorization and access resources behind protected
pages.

**CVE List**

**FPSA001:** Remote Privilege Escalation

Summary

A vulnerability in the web management interface of FatPipe software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with read-only privileges to elevate privileges to the level of an Administrator user on an affected device.

Affected Products

WARP, MPVPN, IPVPN

10.1.2 and 10.2.2 versions prior to releases with the fix (see Fixed Software).

Details

A vulnerability in the web management interface of FatPipe software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with read-only privileges to elevate privileges to the level of an Administrator user on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to a lack of input and validation checking mechanisms for certain HTTP requests on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a modified HTTP request to the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker as a read-only user to execute functions as if they were an administrative user.

FatPipe has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

Workarounds

There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. To mitigate the vulnerability, disable UI access on all the WAN interfaces or configure Access Lists on the interface page to allow access only from trusted sources.

Fixed Software

10.1.2r60p91 or later

10.2.2r42 or later

**FPSA002:** Hidden Backdoor Account (Write Access)

Summary

For centralized management, FatPipe uses a user account that allows the current logged in user to access multiple devices from the web management interface of FatPipe software. This was not intended to be used to directly log into the web management interface. Someone can use it to log into the web interface.

Affected Products

WARP, MPVPN, IPVPN

10.1.2 and 10.2.2 versions prior to releases with the fix (see Fixed Software).

Details

For centralized management, FatPipe uses a user account that allows the current logged in user to access multiple appliances from the web management interface of FatPipe software. This was not intended to be used to directly log into the web management interface. Someone can use it to log into the web management interface.

While this user account is not displayed in the Users list, the customer has control over the password for this user account. On the Users page, you can set the password in for this user.

FatPipe has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Newer versions of our software do not allow a user to login directly using this user account (see Fixed Software).

Workarounds

Disable "Central Manager Login".

Fixed Software
