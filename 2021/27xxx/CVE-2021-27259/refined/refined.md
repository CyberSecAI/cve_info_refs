Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-27259

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability lies within the Toolgate component of Parallels Desktop.
* It stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which leads to an integer overflow before allocating a buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* Integer Overflow: User-supplied data is not properly validated, causing an integer overflow before a buffer allocation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
* Privilege Escalation: An attacker can escalate privileges to execute arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor.
* Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code at the hypervisor level.

**Attack vectors:**
* Local Attack: The attack must originate from the local system.
* Low-Privileged Code Execution: The attacker must already have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code within the guest operating system running on Parallels Desktop.
* The attacker needs to be able to supply data that triggers the integer overflow in the Toolgate component.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability was reported to Parallels on 2020-10-06 and a fix was released on 2021-02-24
