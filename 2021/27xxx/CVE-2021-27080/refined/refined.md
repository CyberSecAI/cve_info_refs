{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the improper initialization of the `i_lru` member of the mqueue inode structure within the Linux kernel of Microsoft Azure Sphere when the `CONFIG_DISABLE_MQUEUE_INODE_CACHE` optimization is enabled, causing the use of an uninitialized variable.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use of an uninitialized variable, specifically the `i_lru` member of the inode struct. This uninitialized state leads to a double free condition when the inode is destroyed.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution in the kernel.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered either by creating and opening a message queue (mqueue) in the root IPC namespace with a very large `mq_maxsize` or `mq_msgsize`, or by creating and destroying an IPC namespace. The most reliable method involves creating a new user namespace and then a new IPC namespace using unshare and exiting it.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to execute code on the target system, and requires no special privileges to create user and IPC namespaces. They need to be able to manipulate the heap via kernel heap spraying in order to poison the inode object before it's allocated for the mqueue superblock."
