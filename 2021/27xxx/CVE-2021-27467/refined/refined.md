Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-27467:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Improper restriction of rendered UI layers or frames (Clickjacking).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The affected product's web interface does not properly restrict how it's rendered within frames or layers. This allows an attacker to potentially overlay a malicious page on top of the legitimate interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could route clicks or keystrokes intended for the legitimate interface to another page under their control. This can be leveraged to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information by tricking users into performing actions they did not intend on the attacker's page.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack is performed remotely via a web browser. The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a page they control that embeds the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage. The user must be tricked into visiting this page. The attacker does not need any prior privileges to perform the attack. User interaction (clicking/typing) is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
