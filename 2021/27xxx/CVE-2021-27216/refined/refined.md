Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-27216:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `delete_pid_file()` function, specifically the race condition between opening the pid file for reading (`Ufopen`) and then deleting it (`Uunlink`). The vulnerability is triggered via the `-oP` and `-oPX` options, which control the pid file path and its deletion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Race condition:** The core weakness is a race condition between the file open and unlink operations. A local attacker can exploit this timing gap.
- **Arbitrary file deletion:** The vulnerability allows for the deletion of any file on the system where the Exim process has write access, as it runs as root when deleting the pid file.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary file deletion:** A successful exploit allows a local attacker to delete any file on the system, which can lead to:
    - Denial of service (by deleting critical system files).
    - Potential privilege escalation (if an attacker can target specific configuration files).

**Attack vectors:**

- Local access is required. An attacker needs to be able to execute commands on the system.
- The attacker must supply the `-oP` option to specify the file to be deleted and potentially the `-oPX` to trigger the deletion.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- A local user with the ability to execute the Exim binary with specific command-line options.
- The attacker needs to win a race condition between the fopen and unlink calls within the Exim process.

**Additional Information:**

- This vulnerability was introduced in Exim version 4.94.
- The advisory notes that exploiting the race condition is "left as an exercise for the interested reader," implying that it is not a difficult exploit to achieve.
