Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27039:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper parsing of TIFF and PCX files. Specifically, a maliciously crafted TIFF or PCX file can cause the software to read and write beyond allocated memory boundaries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read/Write:** The core weakness is the ability to read from and write to memory locations outside the allocated buffer when processing specially crafted TIFF and PCX files. This is a classic memory corruption vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** The primary impact of successfully exploiting this vulnerability is the potential for arbitrary code execution. By controlling the out-of-bounds read/write, an attacker can overwrite critical parts of memory, leading to execution of malicious code in the context of the affected application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File:** The attack vector involves a malicious actor crafting a specially crafted TIFF or PCX file.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to open the malicious file with a vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious TIFF or PCX file.
*   The attacker needs to trick or convince the victim to open this specially crafted file within the vulnerable application (Autodesk Design Review in this case).
*   The attacker must have the skill and resources to create malicious files tailored to exploit the out-of-bounds read/write vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**

*   Autodesk Design Review versions 2018, 2017, 2013, 2012, and 2011.
*   The advisory also mentions that several other Autodesk products (AutoCAD, Advance Steel, Civil 3D, etc.) are affected, but does not specify that this specific CVE is relevant to these other products; these products are only mentioned because they share similar vulnerabilities listed in the advisory.

**Mitigation:**

*   Users of affected versions are advised to install the latest hotfix or upgrade to a more recent version of the affected product(s).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory groups multiple vulnerabilities together (CVE-2021-27033, CVE-2021-27035, CVE-2021-27036, CVE-2021-27037, CVE-2021-27038, CVE-2021-27039, CVE-2021-40167, CVE-2022-27525, CVE-2022-27526, CVE-2022-27529, CVE-2022-27530, CVE-2022-27869, CVE-2022-27870).
