{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the 'HeapTrack_alloc' function of Texas Instruments TI-RTOS.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow or Wraparound (CWE-190)"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to code execution due to the function returning a valid pointer to a small buffer when extremely large values are provided. This allows for arbitrary memory allocation leading to unexpected behaviour such as a crash or code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "The specific attack vector is local with high complexity but no user interaction.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs local access to the system or device.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Texas Instruments TI-RTOS"
    ]
