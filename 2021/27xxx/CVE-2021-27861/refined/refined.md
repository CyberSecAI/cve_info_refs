  "CVE-2021-27861": {
    "description": "Layer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard can be bypassed using LLC/SNAP headers with invalid length (and optionally VLAN0 headers).",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of 802.3 length fields within Ethernet frames when combined with LLC/SNAP headers. Some devices performing L2 security checks do not correctly validate the 802.3 length field, especially if the length is inconsistent with the frame length or if it falls between 1501 and 1535, which are undefined for standard 802.3 frames. By crafting packets with these invalid lengths, an attacker can bypass security controls.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of 802.3 length field.",
       "Lack of consistent handling of invalid 802.3 lengths within L2 security devices."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass L2 security controls, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) or man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. This is achieved by injecting malicious traffic, such as rogue Router Advertisements, which could re-route traffic to attacker controlled destinations or eavesdrop on network traffic.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting Ethernet frames with LLC/SNAP headers and invalid 802.3 length fields.",
      "Sending the malicious frames through a vulnerable L2 network device."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to craft network packets and inject them into the network segment. They need to know or be able to discover the L2 topology in order to direct malicious traffic towards a target.",
