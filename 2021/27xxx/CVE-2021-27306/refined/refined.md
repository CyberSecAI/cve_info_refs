  "0": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Kong API Gateway prior to 2.3.2.0 does not normalize the incoming request URI before matching against the Router. This allowed an attacker to bypass authentication by using an unauthenticated route with a path traversal.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Path traversal vulnerability, authentication bypass, and incorrect subroute inheritance.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Access to an authenticated route without proper authentication.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a request to an unauthenticated route with a path traversal like `public/../api/v1/customers`.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to a Kong API Gateway that uses the JWT plugin and has an unauthenticated route. Also, the attacker requires a service or proxy in the middle which normalizes the path and send the request to the application."
