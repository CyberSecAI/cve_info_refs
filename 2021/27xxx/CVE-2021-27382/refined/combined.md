SSA-574442: Multiple PAR and DFT File Parsing Vulnerabilities in
Solid Edge

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

2021-04-13

V1.1

SUMMARY

Siemens has released a new version for Solid Edge to ﬁx multiple vulnerabilities that could be triggered
when the application reads ﬁles in different ﬁle formats (PAR, DFT extensions). If a user is tricked to open
a malicious ﬁle with the affected application, this could lead to a crash, and potentially also to arbitrary
code execution or data extraction on the target host system.

Siemens recommends to update to the latest version and to avoid opening of untrusted ﬁles from unknown
sources.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Solid Edge is a portfolio of software tools that addresses various product development processes : 3D
design, simulation, manufacturing and design management.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-28385

Affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DFT ﬁles. This could
result in an out of bounds write past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker could leverage this

#### 4.2.4    [OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)

Affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PAR files. This could result in an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.

[CVE-2021-27380](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-27380) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 4.2.5    [STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)

Affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing of PAR files. This could result in a stack-based buffer overflow. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.

[CVE-2021-27382](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-27382) has been assigned to this vulnerability.

Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014) for more information on social engineering attacks.
