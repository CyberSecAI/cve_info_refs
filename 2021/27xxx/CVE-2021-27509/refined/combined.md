* **PERFORMANCE**: Efficiency improvements for MCS data retrieval

### 11.0a, June 27th, 2020 (build 5211)

* **NEW**: Advanced data publishing system (requires license) for automated reports such as VoIP assessment or throughput assessment. Supports automated report generation and distribution. The system interfaces to the testing process to automatically generate reports when the testing has completed. ([learn more](/support/v11/userguide/ug-publishing.html#mainugdiv))
* **NEW**: Business Calendar. The business calendar allows testing and reporting to integrate into business timetables, end-of-week report or run a capacity test at 3 am on Sunday([learn more](/support/v11/userguide/manage-calendar.html#mainugdiv))
* **NEW**: Work Order Actions. Satellite work orders can now be set up to initiate an action(s) on completion of a work order or part work order. Actions deliver the flexibility for work order data collection to automatically interface to assessment report publication. ([learn more](/support/v11/userguide/mcs-actions.html#mainugdiv))
* **NEW**: Behavioral Testing. Automated test processing now supports the ability to synchronize remotely distributed satellites. This interface allows a network to be tested across any size of enterprise. For example, a 1000 concurrent VoIP call simulation could be configured to run 100 G711 concurrent call simulations from 10 call center locations at the same time. Network behavioral testing allows the network configuration and policies to be challenged at any level of bandwidth including the integration of competing traffic to assess application coexistence, such as a heavy download or other data traffic. ([learn more](/resources/casestudies/sync-timer-assessment.html))
* **NEW**: User and work order accounts. Automated assessment testing can now be directed to run under an account ownership structure. The application of the account structure allows data to be partitioned by user or business project.
* **NEW**: Web-socket testing. MCS 11 supports the ability to run a basic data test administered only by the browser with no plug-in. Advanced protocol testing such as accurate RFC6349 data, VoIP, Route, Firewall, Capacity etc. naturally requires a plug-in. It should be noted that, as the browser is the initiator of the data transfer, any web-socket compliant test results will vary based on the performance of the browser used.
