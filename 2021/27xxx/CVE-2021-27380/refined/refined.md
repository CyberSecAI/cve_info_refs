Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2021-27380**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PAR files within the affected applications.

*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds write. The application does not properly validate input data, which leads to writing data past the end of an allocated memory buffer.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process. This can result in a crash, and potentially also to arbitrary code execution or data extraction on the target host system.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by a user opening a specially crafted PAR file.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious PAR file with a vulnerable version of Solid Edge. The attacker does not require any privileges and the attack vector is local, meaning they would need to have the victim open the malicious file on the local machine.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Solid Edge.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Francis Provencher {PRL} and rgod, working with Trend Microâ€™s Zero Day Initiative.
*   Siemens has released updates to address this vulnerability, recommending users update to the specified versions or later.
