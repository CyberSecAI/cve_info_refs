  "CVE-2021-27862": {
    "Root cause": "Layer 2 network filtering capabilities in various devices and operating systems can be bypassed by sending crafted packets with invalid length LLC/SNAP headers and Ethernet to Wifi frame conversion.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete input validation of Ethernet frame headers.",
      "Lack of proper handling of stacked VLAN headers.",
      "Incorrect parsing of LLC/SNAP headers with invalid lengths.",
       "Inconsistencies in handling frame conversions between different network types like Ethernet and Wifi."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can bypass network security controls such as IPv6 RA guard, Dynamic ARP Inspection, and other L2 filtering mechanisms. This allows them to perform man-in-the-middle attacks, cause denial of service, and misconfigure network devices.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafting Ethernet frames with combinations of VLAN 0 priority tags, LLC/SNAP headers, and invalid lengths.",
      "Exploiting inconsistencies in frame conversion between Ethernet and Wifi.",
       "Sending rogue Router Advertisement (RA) packets with crafted headers to misconfigure network devices."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be on the same L2 network segment as the target and be able to send crafted Ethernet frames."
