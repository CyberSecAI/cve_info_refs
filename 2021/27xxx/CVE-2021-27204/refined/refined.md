Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2021-27204:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Telegram for macOS application (specifically version 7.3 (211334) Stable) was found to store local copies of received audio/video messages from secret chats even after those messages were self-destructed. The self-destruct feature is intended to remove messages from both devices after a set time.
- Additionally, the same version of Telegram for macOS was found to store the local passcode in plain text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Data Leakage:** The application fails to properly remove locally stored media files (audio/video) associated with self-destructing messages in secret chats. This is a privacy vulnerability, as deleted content persists on the device.
- **Plain Text Storage:** Local passcodes are stored in plain text, which exposes them to anyone with local access to the device, bypassing encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privacy Breach:** An attacker with access to the device can access the locally stored media files even after they are supposed to be deleted. This bypasses the privacy provided by the self-destructing message feature and could lead to exposure of sensitive data.
- **Passcode Exposure:** An attacker with local access to the device can extract the user's passcode, potentially leading to unauthorized account access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the macOS device where Telegram is installed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have physical or remote access to the target's macOS machine.
- The attacker does not need to be a user of the Telegram application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Telegram for macOS version 7.3 (211334) Stable.
- It was patched in version 7.4 (212543) Stable.
- The researcher who discovered the vulnerability was awarded a 3000 EURO bounty.
