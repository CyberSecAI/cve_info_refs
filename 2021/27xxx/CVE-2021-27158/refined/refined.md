Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-27158:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the presence of **hardcoded credentials** within the HTTP server's binary (`webs`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The `webs` binary contains a list of hardcoded usernames and passwords for different ISPs. These credentials can be used to authenticate to the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the device's web management interface.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  These credentials can be used to open the CLI telnet access, leading to further exploitation and eventually root access on the device.
*   **Device Control:** Once authenticated, an attacker can potentially modify the device's configuration and gain full control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attacker would need to access the device's web interface (e.g., `https://<device_ip>/fh`).
*   **Brute-force/Credential Stuffing:** The attacker can attempt to log in with the hardcoded credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the device, which could be from the LAN or WAN (due to the lack of IPv6 firewall).
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the hardcoded credentials.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided document lists a large number of hardcoded credentials including `user / user1234`, `f~i!b@e#r$h%o^m\*esuperadmin / s(f)u\_h+g|u`, `admin / lnadmin`, etc.
*   The credentials can be used to login into the web interface and enable the CLI telnet.
*   The CLI telnet then provides further methods to gain a root shell via other vulnerabilities.
