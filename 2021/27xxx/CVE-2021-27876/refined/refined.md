{
  "CVE-2021-27876": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization on data management protocol commands.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "An authenticated client can use specially crafted input parameters in a data management protocol command to access an arbitrary file on the system using System privileges."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can read sensitive files on the Backup Exec agent machine.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network-based, requires an authenticated client connection to the Backup Exec Agent.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have an authenticated session with the Backup Exec Agent, which they could potentially achieve by exploiting a vulnerability in the SHA authentication scheme (CVE-2021-27877). After successful authentication, they need to craft specific input parameters to the data management protocol commands."
  }
