Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `curWebPage` parameter of the Askey internet fiber modem's web interface. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code via the GET or POST request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Specifically, the vulnerability is a reflected XSS because the injected JavaScript is reflected back in the response.
- Lack of input sanitization: The web application doesn't properly sanitize the `curWebPage` parameter before rendering it in the web page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing sensitive information (e.g., cookies, credentials)
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim
    - Defacement of the web interface

**Attack vectors:**
- Via GET Request: An attacker can craft a malicious URL with the payload in the `curWebPage` parameter and send it to a victim.
- Via POST Request: An attacker can intercept a legitimate login request, inject the payload into the `curWebPage` parameter in the POST data, and then forward the modified request to the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted URL to a victim or intercept the victim's login request and manipulate the request. No authentication is needed.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `curWebPage`.
- The vulnerable software is Askey Internet Fiber Modem, specifically model RTF8115VW with software version BR_SV_g11.11_RTF_TEF001_V6.54_V014.
- The provided payloads are `";alert('xss')//` when appended to the curWebPage parameter.
- The vulnerability can be triggered through both GET and POST requests.
- The provided request examples show how to inject the payload with both methods.
