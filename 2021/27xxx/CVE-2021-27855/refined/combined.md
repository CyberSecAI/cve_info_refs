# Summary: FatPipe Networks invented the concept of router-clustering,
# which provides the highest level of reliability, redundancy, and speed
# of Internet traffic for Business Continuity and communications. FatPipe
# WARP achieves fault tolerance for companies by creating an easy method
# of combining two or more Internet connections of any kind over multiple
# ISPs. FatPipe utilizes all paths when the lines are up and running,
# dynamically balancing traffic over the multiple lines, and intelligently
# failing over inbound and outbound IP traffic when ISP services and/or
# components fail.
#
# FatPipe IPVPN balances load and provides reliability among multiple
# managed and CPE based VPNs as well as dedicated private networks. FatPipe
# IPVPN can also provide you an easy low-cost migration path from private
# line, Frame or Point-to-Point networks. You can aggregate multiple private,
# MPLS and public networks without additional equipment at the provider's
# site.
#
# FatPipe MPVPN, a patented router clustering device, is an essential part
# of Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Planning for Virtual Private
# Network (VPN) connectivity. It makes any VPN up to 900% more secure and
# 300% times more reliable, redundant and faster. MPVPN can take WANs with
# an uptime of 99.5% or less and make them 99.999988% or higher, providing
# a virtually infallible WAN. MPVPN dynamically balances load over multiple
# lines and ISPs without the need for BGP programming. MPVPN aggregates up
# to 10Gbps - 40Gbps of bandwidth, giving you all the reliability and speed
# you need to keep your VPN up and running despite failures of service, line,
# software, or hardware.
#
# Desc: The application suffers from a privilege escalation vulnerability.
# A normal user (group USER, 0) can elevate her privileges by sending a HTTP
# POST request and setting the JSON parameter 'privilege' to integer value
# '1' gaining administrative rights (group ADMINISTRATOR, 1).

#### FatPipe Networks WARP/IPVPN/MPVPN 10.2.2 Remote Privilege Escalation

Title: FatPipe Networks WARP/IPVPN/MPVPN 10.2.2 Remote Privilege Escalation

Advisory ID: [ZSL-2021-5685](ZSL-2021-5685.php)

Type: Local/Remote

Impact: Privilege Escalation

Risk: (4/5)

Release Date: 27.09.2021
##### Summary

FatPipe Networks invented the concept of router-clustering,
which provides the highest level of reliability, redundancy, and speed
of Internet traffic for Business Continuity and communications. FatPipe
WARP achieves fault tolerance for companies by creating an easy method
of combining two or more Internet connections of any kind over multiple
ISPs. FatPipe utilizes all paths when the lines are up and running,
dynamically balancing traffic over the multiple lines, and intelligently
failing over inbound and outbound IP traffic when ISP services and/or
components fail.

FatPipe IPVPN balances load and provides reliability among multiple
managed and CPE based VPNs as well as dedicated private networks. FatPipe
IPVPN can also provide you an easy low-cost migration path from private
line, Frame or Point-to-Point networks. You can aggregate multiple private,
MPLS and public networks without additional equipment at the provider's
site.

FatPipe MPVPN, a patented router clustering device, is an essential part
of Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Planning for Virtual Private
Network (VPN) connectivity. It makes any VPN up to 900% more secure and
300% times more reliable, redundant and faster. MPVPN can take WANs with
an uptime of 99.5% or less and make them 99.999988% or higher, providing
a virtually infallible WAN. MPVPN dynamically balances load over multiple
lines and ISPs without the need for BGP programming. MPVPN aggregates up
to 10Gbps - 40Gbps of bandwidth, giving you all the reliability and speed
you need to keep your VPN up and running despite failures of service, line,
software, or hardware.
##### Description

The application suffers from a privilege escalation vulnerability.
A normal user (group USER, 0) can elevate her privileges by sending a HTTP
POST request and setting the JSON parameter 'privilege' to integer value
'1' gaining administrative rights (group ADMINISTRATOR, 1).

**CVE List**

**FPSA001:** Remote Privilege Escalation

Summary

A vulnerability in the web management interface of FatPipe software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with read-only privileges to elevate privileges to the level of an Administrator user on an affected device.

Affected Products

WARP, MPVPN, IPVPN

10.1.2 and 10.2.2 versions prior to releases with the fix (see Fixed Software).

Details

A vulnerability in the web management interface of FatPipe software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with read-only privileges to elevate privileges to the level of an Administrator user on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to a lack of input and validation checking mechanisms for certain HTTP requests on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a modified HTTP request to the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker as a read-only user to execute functions as if they were an administrative user.

FatPipe has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

Workarounds

There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. To mitigate the vulnerability, disable UI access on all the WAN interfaces or configure Access Lists on the interface page to allow access only from trusted sources.

Fixed Software

10.1.2r60p91 or later

10.2.2r42 or later

Source

**FPSA002:** Hidden Backdoor Account (Write Access)

Summary

For centralized management, FatPipe uses a user account that allows the current logged in user to access multiple devices from the web management interface of FatPipe software. This was not intended to be used to directly log into the web management interface. Someone can use it to log into the web interface.

Affected Products

WARP, MPVPN, IPVPN

10.1.2 and 10.2.2 versions prior to releases with the fix (see Fixed Software).

Details

For centralized management, FatPipe uses a user account that allows the current logged in user to access multiple appliances from the web management interface of FatPipe software. This was not intended to be used to directly log into the web management interface. Someone can use it to log into the web management interface.

While this user account is not displayed in the Users list, the customer has control over the password for this user account. On the Users page, you can set the password in for this user.

FatPipe has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Newer versions of our software do not allow a user to login directly using this user account (see Fixed Software).

Workarounds

Disable "Central Manager Login".

Fixed Software
