# Poll vote count SQL injection

Moderate

[dvz](/dvz)
published
GHSA-23m9-w75q-ph4p
Mar 10, 2021

## Package

MyBB

## Affected versions

< 1.8.26

## Patched versions

1.8.26

## Description

### Impact

The number of votes in thread poll options can be modified by authors and saved without proper validation. This data may be fetched and re-inserted into the database during the *Copy Thread* operation without being properly sanitized, resulting in an SQL injection vulnerability.

The impact may be reduced when:

* creating and editing thread polls is disabled or limited for forum users.
