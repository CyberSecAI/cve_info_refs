{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The web daemon contains a list of hardcoded credentials for different ISPs, which can be used to gain access to the device's web interface and, subsequently, the CLI telnet server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Hardcoded credentials within the web daemon.",
      "Lack of proper access controls and credential management."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the device's web interface and potentially the CLI telnet server. This can lead to full device compromise, allowing for remote code execution and potentially network access.",
      "attack_vectors": [
      "The hardcoded credentials can be used to log into the web interface.",
      "Once logged in, an attacker can enable the telnet server and use other vulnerabilities, such as authentication bypass, to gain root access."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to access the web interface and use one of the hardcoded credentials from the list."
