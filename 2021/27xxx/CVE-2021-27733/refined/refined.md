The provided content is a security bulletin from JetBrains, which includes information about CVE-2021-27733.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored XSS via attached file in YouTrack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data when attaching a file to a YouTrack issue.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the attached file, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when the file is accessed through YouTrack. This could lead to arbitrary actions within the application on behalf of the victim, including session hijacking, data theft, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves uploading a malicious file to YouTrack, then a user accesses it via the YouTrack application, thus triggering the XSS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to upload files to YouTrack, which might require an account with relevant permissions.
