### (Updated) Last update broke the app for me

> Last update made the app very unreliable for me. I open the app and I see all my devices but when I tap on them they just donât respond. Force closing the app sometimes gets them to work. I have Siri shortcuts set through ifttt. They work reliably. I also have voice commands through google home mini that work reliably. Itâs just the eWeLink app that gives me trouble now. Devices have been fantastic otherwise. Just wish the app was reliable.
>
> I figured out the reliability problem for me is related to newer Lan Mode feature. Found the setting to turn it off for each switch and now everything works fine. Thatâs a shame though. My internet has gone out and left me unable to
> Control switches remotely. Be great to have this feature working reliably.

### Easy to use works great

> The eWeLink app makes setup & configuration of smart devices very easy. I used the app with a Sonoff 4ch Pro. Within 10 minutes out of the box i had the Sonoff 4ch Pro working properly. This time includes installing & registering the eWeLink app, connecting the Sonoff 4ch Pro to wireless, updating the firmware and even adding the skill to Alexa.
>
> The eWeLink app is great, you can change the inching (momentary) settings for each switch, including the duration. There are a lot of other settings for the Sonoff 4ch Pro that can be adjusted through the app.
>
> \*Keep in mind, during initial configuration the eWeLink app will connect the smart device to the wireless network that your mobile device is using. After configuration your mobile device will be able to control the smart device through the eWeLink app from any network.

### Piece of junk

> Literally, the worst app Iâve ever installed and used in my life. The lightbulbs are ALWAYS irresponsible and offline. I have to rest the light 2-3 times every single day. No we to contact eWeLink or Sonoff. Iâve installed all light switches, light bulbs and âsmartâ plugs from Sonoff, which use this horrible app that never worked properly for one straight week without failing.
>
> Iâve tried everything from resetting the lightbulb, which is a pain in the behind to do so and if you are very lucky, the light bulb would rest. I on the other hand, have tried everything with these light bulbs and they will never connect to this horrible. I also deleted every single smart device from my router and reprogrammed everything. EWeLink and Sonoff are the only light bulbs that are always irresponsive and I was never able to get them to work even when I changed my entire network and password.
>
> Do yourself a favor and buy proper light bulbs and smart devices from somewhere else.

### Developer Response ,

> Dear user, we understand how you feel. Sorry for the trouble. Please keep your devices close to your router and reduce the connected devices to your router for a better network connection.

June 6, 2020Excellent app. Very useful. I've 2 feature requests: 1. Please increase the length of inching time. 60 minutes isn't enough in some cases. 2. Can you include more logic in the scenes please? For example, if I turn on a light, I would like it to stay on until I decide to turn it off. But if that light is turned on as part of a scene, I'd like it to turn off after x amount of time.4 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/EGemoI2NTXmTsBVtJqk8jxF9rh8ApRWfsIMQSt2uE4OcpQqbFu7f7NbTK05lx80nuSijCz7sc3a277R67g=s32-rw)A Google user*more\_vert*

January 8, 2020This is a superb app. Far superior to other IoT control apps I have used. It offers timers, looping, inching (turning off after a set interval - very useful), but allows local control when your internet link is down. It has got better with every iteration. It even allows you to download power consumption data when used with a device that monitors power. The issue with needing a 2.4GHz WiFi network is a device imposed issue rather than an app issue. A great app, but there is still room for improvement. Initial pairing can sometimes be difficult - it would be helpful to get more feedback during the process. The app is a bit clunky in appearance - lots of screen space for each device. I have a lot of devices and it takes a long time to scroll through them. I also look forward to the time when historical temperature data is available from devices like the Sonoff TH16. Despite the room for improvement, this is still a five-star app, especially because it is constantly being improved.14 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU0IVo7an33FWcFfCQgD3HX5b_Cpzh4vs1joIJVocI6n_rquaM=s32-rw)Dan Baronetti*more\_vert*

March 14, 2022So many problems with every step of the set up. Put device in pairing mode and the app can't find the device. Why can't you just tap your phone to connect to it like most other smart tech. This is outdated technology. Then to connect to Google the instructions are download Google home... And then?? This is not a Google product. What next?7 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews

# eWeLink mobile Application - Incorrect Access Control Vulnerability (CVE-2021-27941)

Unconstrained Web access to the device's private encryption key in the QR code pairing mode in the eWeLink mobile application (through 4.9.2 on Android and through 4.9.1 on iOS) allows a physically proximate attacker to eavesdrop on Wi-Fi credentials and other sensitive information by monitoring the Wi-Fi spectrum during a device pairing process.

# Pairing protocol and vulnerability details

From the user perspective, the QR code-based pairing process between the IoT device and the user’s WiFi, through the eWeLink application, acts as follows:

* the user boots the IoT device into paring mode.
* the user scans the QR-code attached to the IoT device with the eWeLink application.
* the application connects to a remote service to retrieve some device information, among which the device secret-key.
* the application connects to the device soft AP WiFi.
* the application uses the device secret key to encrypt a message with the target WiFi credential and send it to the device.
* the device uses the credential to access the home WiFi network,
* the eWeLink application adds the IoT device to the user’s device list (using a remote Cloud service).

The QR code label supplied with a supported device (a Sonoff Micro from ITEAD) encodes the following URL [https://api.coolkit.cn:8080/add-ap-device?brand=ewelink\&ssid=ITEAD-device\_id](https://api.coolkit.cn:8080/add-ap-device?brand=ewelink%5C&ssid=ITEAD-device_id), where:

* the SSID parameter is the name of the WiFi network that is broadcasted by the device during the pairing process.
* the device\_id is an alphanumeric string that represents the unique device id, which is used by the eWeLink application to query the Coolkit remote API and retrieve the device private encryption key (previously referenced as secret key).

During the first step, the application connects to eu-api.coolkit.cc:8080/api/user/fdbaseinfo?deviceid=device\_id&other\_parameters endpoint, from which it retrieves the device secret-key, along with other device information. According to the above-described flow, the service invoked by the application returns a key that is then used to encrypt (using the AES algorithm) the user’s WiFi credentials before sending them to the IoT device through the dedicated softAP WiFi network.
An encrypted JSON message is sent through an http post request to the open device http server.
The original payload follows the structure reported below:
`{"ssid" : "Test-Network", "password" : "Test-Password", "serverName" : "eu-disp.coolkit.cc", "port" : 443}`
where the "Test-Network" and "Test-Password" parameters are the network credentials we chose for our testbed configuration, and the eu-disp.coolkit.cc is the cloud platform serving the European region.

We ran different tests, and we noticed that during the pairing process everyone near the WiFi soft AP can retrieve the device\_id parameter, since it is part of the device softAP WiFi SSID.
To retrieve a particular device secret-key you just need:

* a valid user account registered on the eWeLink platform.
* the device\_id parameter.

As a consequence, just by knowing a device id, the corresponding device secret key can be easily retrieved.
This enables a nearby malicious user to grab the user’s WiFi credentials by eavesdropping on the configuration message transmitted by the user’s smartphone to the IoT device. Note that, the device softAP Wifi is open and unprotected by default, so eavesdropping is possible.

After retrieving the secret key from the cloud services (together with the already known device\_id parameter), the malicious user could decrypt the configuration message and extract the user’s WiFi credentials.
As a consequence, the customer's full home network is compromised.
