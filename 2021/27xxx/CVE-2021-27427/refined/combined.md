The friendly Operating System for IoT!

RIOT is an open-source microcontroller operating system, designed to match
the requirements of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and other embedded devices.
It supports a range of devices that are typically found in the Internet of Things (IoT):
8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers.

RIOT is based on the following design principles: energy-efficiency, real-time
capabilities, small memory footprint, modularity, and uniform API access,
independent of the underlying hardware (this API offers partial POSIX
compliance).

RIOT is developed by an international open source community which is
independent of specific vendors (e.g. similarly to the Linux community).
RIOT is licensed with LGPLv2.1, a copyleft license which fosters
indirect business models around the free open-source software platform
provided by RIOT, e.g. it is possible to link closed-source code with the
LGPL code.

## Features

RIOT provides features including, but not limited to:

* a preemptive, tickless scheduler with priorities
* flexible memory management
* high resolution, long-term timers
* MTD abstraction layer
* File System integration
* support 200+ boards based on AVR, MSP430, ESP8266, ESP32, RISC-V,
  ARM7 and ARM Cortex-M
* the native port allows to run RIOT as-is on Linux and BSD.
  Multiple instances of RIOT running on a single machine can also be
  interconnected via a simple virtual Ethernet bridge or via a simulated
  IEEE 802.15.4 network (ZEP)
* IPv6
* 6LoWPAN (RFC4944, RFC6282, and RFC6775)
* UDP
* RPL (storing mode, P2P mode)
* CoAP
* OTA updates via SUIT
* MQTT
* USB (device mode)
* Display / Touchscreen support
* CCN-Lite
* LoRaWAN
* UWB
* Bluetooth (BLE) via [NimBLE](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-nimble)

## Getting RIOT

The most convenient way to get RIOT is to clone it via Git

```
$ git clone https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT
```

this will ensure that you get all the newest features and bug fixes with the
caveat of an ever changing work environment.

If you prefer things more stable, you can download the source code of one of our
quarter annual releases [via Github](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/releases) as ZIP file or tarball. You can
also checkout a release in a cloned Git repository using

```
$ git pull --tags
$ git checkout <YYYY.MM>
```

For more details on our release cycle, check our [documentation](https://doc.riot-os.org/release-cycle.html).

## Getting Started

* You want to start the RIOT? Just follow our
  [quickstart guide](https://doc.riot-os.org/index.html#the-quickest-start) or
  try this
  [tutorial](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/Tutorials/blob/master/README.md).
  For specific toolchain installation, follow instructions in the
  [getting started](https://doc.riot-os.org/getting-started.html) page.
* The RIOT API itself can be built from the code using doxygen. The latest
  version of the documentation is uploaded daily to
  [doc.riot-os.org](https://doc.riot-os.org).

Using Windows? Use [this guide](/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/master/doc/guides/setup-windows) to
[setup the development environment](/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/master/doc/guides/setup-windows).

## Community

You can ask for help on the Forum or on Matrix. Please send bug reports and
feature requests to our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/issues)

* [forum](https://forum.riot-os.org) is the default place to start asking for
  help. Our Forum provides an archive of prior questions and answers.
* For chat, we use
  [#riot-os:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#riot-os:matrix.org) on the
  [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) chat network.
* [GitHub Issue tracker](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/issues) for issues
  with the code and documentation.

### How to Ask

Please include as much detail as you can that is relevant to your question, not
only "this isn't working". These details include:

1. What you want to achieve.
2. What have you tried so far (for example the commands you typed).
3. What happened so far.

### Collaboration

RIOT closely collaborates with and inspires other open source projects, e.g., [Ariel OS](https://ariel-os.org/), an IoT OS written in Rust. We are more than happy to collaborate with those who share our [vision](https://doc.riot-os.org/vision.html).

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Apply available vendor updates.
* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
