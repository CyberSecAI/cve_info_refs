    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "Integer wrap-around in the implementation of the `calloc` function.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Integer Overflow or Wraparound (CWE-190)"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary memory allocation, which can lead to unexpected behavior such as a crash or remote code injection/execution.",
       "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered when a large value is provided to the `calloc` function, causing an integer overflow or wraparound during the calculation of the memory to be allocated. This can be exploited remotely.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities or positions are mentioned other than the ability to trigger the vulnerable `calloc` function, which the advisory indicates can be achieved remotely and with low attack complexity."
