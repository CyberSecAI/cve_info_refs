Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the DynPG admin login panel, specifically when handling the "query" parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the "query" parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can perform social engineering attacks by redirecting users to fake websites.
- Attackers can steal cookies, leading to account takeovers.
- Attackers can potentially download malware onto users' systems.
- Overall, an XSS vulnerability allows for a wide range of malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL using the vulnerable parameter "query" in the `popup.php` endpoint of the DynPG admin panel.
- Specifically, the URL includes a javascript payload: `query=x"%20onmouseover=alert(4)%20x="`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker would likely need to lure a user, especially an administrator who is logged in, to visit the crafted URL or embed it into a link on a website they may visit, for the XSS to execute.
