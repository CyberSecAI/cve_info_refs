- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper resource shutdown or release. If an attacker leaves the Ethernet communication of the affected product in an open state, Ethernet communication with other devices cannot be established.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper handling of Ethernet communication resources, specifically the failure to correctly close or release these resources.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service, as it prevents Ethernet communications between devices from being established. This can disrupt the operation of industrial control systems that rely on network communication between devices.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to establish a connection with the affected devices. The attack complexity is considered low. No special privileges are required for the attack.
