Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27152:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to hardcoded credentials within the HTTP server component (`webs` binary) of the FiberHome HG6245D router. These credentials can be used to access the web management interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The HTTP server contains a list of hardcoded usernames and passwords for various ISPs. This includes credentials like `admin/lnadmin`, `admin/CUadmin`, `telecomadmin/nE7jA%5m`, and many others. Some of the passwords are also dynamically generated based on the device's MAC address, but are still considered hardcoded.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** While not the primary focus, related vulnerabilities allow an attacker to bypass authentication via the telnet CLI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the router's web management interface using the hardcoded credentials.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Once logged in, attackers can leverage other vulnerabilities, like the telnet backdoor or weak Linux telnet credentials, to gain root access and completely compromise the router.
*   **Network Pivoting:** With control over the router, attackers could potentially pivot into the local network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The primary attack vector is the web interface of the router, accessible over HTTP/HTTPS.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router, either via the local network (IPv4 or IPv6) or, due to the lack of IPv6 firewall, from the internet using the deviceâ€™s IPv6 address.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the router on the network (LAN or WAN through IPv6).
*   **Basic Web Interaction:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP/HTTPS requests to the router.
*   **Knowledge of Credentials:** The attacker needs to try the hardcoded credentials from the provided list, or understand how to generate them based on the MAC address in some cases.

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-27152 is caused by the presence of multiple hardcoded credentials in the webserver of FiberHome HG6245D routers. An attacker can use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to the web interface and further compromise the router via other vulnerabilities, leading to full control of the device. This can be achieved over both LAN and WAN (over IPv6).
