Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27928:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `wsrep_provider` and `wsrep_notify_cmd` system variables in MariaDB were writable at runtime by a database user with `SUPER` privileges. These variables control the path to a shared object library (`.so`) that the server loads with `dlopen()` and a path to a shell script, respectively.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Eval injection via untrusted search path:** The ability to modify `wsrep_provider` and `wsrep_notify_cmd` allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code by specifying a malicious shared object or script path.
- **Insufficient Privilege Control:** Allowing a database user with `SUPER` privileges to modify these system variables that impact system-level execution is an example of insufficient privilege control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with the same privileges as the `mysql` system user. This can lead to complete compromise of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A database user with `SUPER` privileges can modify the `wsrep_provider` and `wsrep_notify_cmd` system variables. This can be done through SQL commands or other interfaces allowing changes to these variables.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have database user access with `SUPER` privileges. This means the attacker has compromised the database server or has a privileged user account to begin with.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by making the `wsrep_provider` and `wsrep_notify_cmd` system variables read-only.
- This vulnerability affects MariaDB versions 10.5, 10.4, 10.3, and 10.2.
- The Debian LTS advisory explicitly states that an untrusted search path leads to the injection vulnerability, meaning arbitrary file path can be provided to trigger the vulnerability.
- This vulnerability affects Galera cluster setups, since it's related to the wsrep variables.

This vulnerability is considered a **blocker** due to its severity, and the potential for complete system compromise.
