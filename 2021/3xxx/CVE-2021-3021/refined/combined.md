# ISPConfig 3.2.2 Released – Important Security Update

This release is an important security release that fixes a SQL injection issue. Please update as soon as possible! If you are not able to update, please use the ISPConfig patch tool to fix the security issue. Special thanks to Cyku Hong from DEVCORE for reporting the issue.

After installing the update or the patch, login or re-login once as admin user for security reasons!

**Patch procedure in case you can’t update your server to ISPConfig 3.2.2**

The patches are available for ISPConfig 3.1 (all versions >= 3.1.12) and ISPConfig 3.2. To apply the patch, run the command:

```
ispconfig_patch
```

as root user on the shell. The command asks for the patch name.

For ISPConfig 3.1.12+, use: **3115\_sqlinjection**

For ISPConfig 3.2, use: **321\_sqlinjection**

Check the info that is shown on the shell and confirm with ‘y’. The patch was successful when the output does not contain the word “FAILED”. If you get an error like ‘patch not found’, then install the Linux command-line tool ‘patch’ on your system and try again.

## What’s new in ISPConfig 3.2.2?
