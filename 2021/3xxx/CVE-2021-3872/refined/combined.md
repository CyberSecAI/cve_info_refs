Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in vim, an
enhanced vi editor. Buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads and Null pointer

unspecified impact.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version

We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.

For the detailed security status of vim please refer to
its security tracker page at:

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
