      "content": "The fix in the framework is what is known as a security tightening measure. It is not indicative of a vulnerability, but it is a response to a potential misuse of our code. If you look carefully at the patch, two things specifically have to happen to cause the misuse:\n\n  - The user must indicate that cleanup (removal of the file seeding the response stream) should occur once the response goes out of scope (at the end of the request).\n\n  - The stream name must be presented as an object implementing \"__toString()\".\n\nThe problem with magic methods such as these is that there are no limits to what you can do in them. Destructors are typically used to cleanup the environment — such as with operations like closing database or cache server connections, removing temp files, etc. Stringables are used in many scenarios, and particularly when providing complex representations or serializing data for API payloads. As such, they are used everywhere.\n\nIt also means they are often targets of PHP Object Injection attacks. A PHP Object Injection attack relies on PHP's serialization engine, and the fact that it will serialize and deserialize any data structure, including classes. When deserializing a class instance, PHP will happily populate any properties at all when doing so.\n\nUnfortunately, prior to PHP 7.4, PHP did not allow providing typehints on class properties, which means that a deserialized instance can set the property values to any type at all, and thus avoid standard typechecks that occur elsewhere in a class — such as public setter methods. This is the primary reason why usage of \"unserialize()\" on untrusted user input is so dangerous, and why it is the root cause of this particular issue.",
       "root cause": "The vulnerability is a result of a combination of PHP's serialization engine, use of magic methods (like `__destruct()` and `__toString()`), lack of typehinting in older PHP versions, and ultimately the insecure use of `unserialize()` on untrusted data.
