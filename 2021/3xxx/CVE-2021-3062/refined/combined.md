### Description

An improper access control vulnerability in PAN-OS software enables an attacker with authenticated access to GlobalProtect portals and gateways to connect to the EC2 instance metadata endpoint for VM-Series firewalls hosted on Amazon AWS.

Exploitation of this vulnerability enables an attacker to perform any operations allowed by the EC2 role in AWS.

This issue impacts:

PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.20 VM-Series firewalls;

PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.11 VM-Series firewalls;

PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.14 VM-Series firewalls;

PAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.8 VM-Series firewalls.

Prisma Access customers are not impacted by this issue.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 10.1 | None | 10.1.\* on VM-Series |
| PAN-OS 10.0 | < 10.0.8 on VM-Series | >= 10.0.8 on VM-Series |
| PAN-OS 9.1 | < 9.1.11 on VM-Series | >= 9.1.11 on VM-Series |
| PAN-OS 9.0 | < 9.0.14 on VM-Series | >= 9.0.14 on VM-Series |
| PAN-OS 8.1 | < 8.1.20 on VM-Series | >= 8.1.20 on VM-Series |
