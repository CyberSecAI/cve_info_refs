- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control in PAN-OS software allows authenticated GlobalProtect users to connect to the EC2 instance metadata endpoint of VM-Series firewalls hosted on Amazon AWS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control (CWE-284)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform any operations allowed by the EC2 role in AWS. This could include actions such as gaining access to sensitive information or modifying resources within the AWS environment.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack, requiring an attacker to have authenticated access to GlobalProtect portals and gateways.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate to a GlobalProtect portal or gateway and the vulnerable PAN-OS version must be running on a VM-Series firewall hosted on AWS.
