Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3664:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `url-parse` library incorrectly handles single backslashes (`\`) after the protocol in URLs.  Specifically, it treats URLs like `https:\` and `https:/` as relative paths instead of interpreting the single backslash as a normal slash like browsers do.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Path Parsing:** The library's failure to normalize single backslashes after the protocol leads to misinterpretation of the URL's structure.
*   **Bypass Potential:** This behavior can be exploited to bypass security measures that rely on `url-parse` for URL validation or filtering.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Allow/Block List Bypasses:** Malicious URLs using single backslashes can slip past allow/block lists designed to filter URLs.
*   **SSRF Attacks:** This vulnerability can contribute to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks by manipulating the parsed URL and making requests to unintended targets.
*   **Open Redirects:** Exploitation can lead to open redirects where a user is redirected to a malicious site.
*   **Other Undesired Behavior:** Depending on the context, other unexpected and potentially harmful actions can occur.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL Injection:** An attacker injects URLs containing single backslashes after the protocol into systems using the vulnerable `url-parse` library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Inject URLs:** The attacker must be able to provide or control the input that is processed by the vulnerable `url-parse` library.
*   **Knowledge of Target System:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of how the target application uses the `url-parse` library and what it does with the parsed URL.

**Additional Information:**
The provided content from the github commit shows the code changes that address the vulnerability by adding specific logic to handle slashes after the protocol for special URLs. The debian security advisory provides more detailed information regarding the impact of the vulnerability and a clear description of the root cause.
