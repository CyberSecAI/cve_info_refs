Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3764:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

The content from `people.canonical.com` explicitly mentions "CVE-2021-3764" and provides details regarding the vulnerability. This confirms the content is directly related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the `ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd()` function within the Linux kernel's AMD Cryptographic Coprocessor (CCP) driver. This memory leak occurs when memory is not properly deallocated under specific error conditions. Specifically, if the `ccp_init_data(&src)` function returns an error. This is similar to the older vulnerability CVE-2019-18808 and CVE-2021-3744 (and a fix for the CVE-2021-3744 also addressed this one, according to the notes section).

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Memory Leak:** The core weakness is a memory leak due to improper deallocation in error paths within the `ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd()` function.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local attacker can exploit the memory leak to cause a denial of service via memory exhaustion, leading to system unavailability.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

-   **Local Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local attacker.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
-   **Low Privileges:** The attacker requires low privileges, meaning that it does not require root level access.

**Additional Details from the content:**

*   The issue is a memory leak in the `ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd()` function, similar to `CVE-2019-18808`.
*   The fix for `CVE-2021-3744` also addresses this issue, indicating a potential code reuse problem.
*   Ubuntu has marked several of its kernels as fixed.
*  Red Hat states the patch for CVE-2021-3744 contains the fix for CVE-2021-3764 as well.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 severity score of 5.5 (Medium).
*   The attack vector is local, attack complexity is low, privileges required are low, user interaction is none, and availability impact is high.

**Patch Information:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced by commit `36cf515` and fixed by `505d9dc`.
*   Patch details are provided as links to the specific commits in the Linux kernel repository.
