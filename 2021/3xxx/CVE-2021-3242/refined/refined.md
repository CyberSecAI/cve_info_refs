- **Root cause of vulnerability**: SQL injection vulnerability in the `tools SendTpl` module.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. It appears that user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or parameterized before being used in an SQL query.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the backend database, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete compromise of the application and underlying system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the `keyword` parameter in the URL `/s/tools/SendTpl/index?keyword=xxx`. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into this parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the `/s/tools/SendTpl/index` URL and manipulate the `keyword` parameter. It is likely that this requires administrative access, but this is not explicitly stated.
