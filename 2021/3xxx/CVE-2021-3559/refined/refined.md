  "CVE-2021-3559": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in libvirt in the virConnectListAllNodeDevices API. It only affects hosts with a PCI device and driver that supports mediated devices (e.g., GRID driver). This flaw could be used by an unprivileged client with a read-only connection to crash the libvirt daemon by executing the 'nodedev-list' virsh command. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.",
    "Root cause": "Incorrect operator precedence when dereferencing an array pointer in `virNodeDeviceGetMdevTypesCaps()` in `src/conf/node_device_conf.c`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect operator precedence",
       "Improper handling of mediated devices"
    ],
    "Impact": "An unprivileged client with a read-only connection can crash the libvirt daemon, resulting in denial of service and system availability issues.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by executing the `nodedev-list` virsh command.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An unprivileged client with a read-only connection to the libvirt daemon is sufficient to trigger the vulnerability. The host must also have a PCI device and a driver that supports mediated devices (e.g., GRID driver).",
    "Affected Products": [
      "ONTAP Select Deploy administration utility"
    ],
    "Patched Versions": [
      "libvirt 7.0.0",
      "ONTAP Select Deploy administration utility 9.14.1"
    ],
     "More Information": "The vulnerability was introduced in libvirt version 6.10.0 via commit f1b08901f7ae7557f79d83bdac33cc0bd79d1437.  It is triggered when an unprivileged client executes the nodedev-list command on a host that has a PCI device and driver that supports mediated devices. The vulnerability is located in the virConnectListAllNodeDevices API and is due to incorrect operator precedence when dereferencing an array pointer in virNodeDeviceGetMdevTypesCaps() in src/conf/node_device_conf.c."
