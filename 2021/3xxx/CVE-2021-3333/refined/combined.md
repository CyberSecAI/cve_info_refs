# Errata - 4.0.1 XSS in SQL debugging output

Owned by [Mark Unwin](/wiki/people/62abcb15979e6e0069071297?ref=confluence&src=profilecard)Last updated: [Jan 18, 2021](/wiki/pages/diffpagesbyversion.action?pageId=3163951262&selectedPageVersions=1&selectedPageVersions=2)Loading data...

When outputting the SQL statements for debugging, a maliciously crafted query can trigger a XSS attack (thanks Thrivikram Gujarathi).

This attack only succeeds if the user is already logged in to Open-AudIT before they click the malicious link.

The issue has been patched. To view the patch, go here - <https://github.com/Opmantek/open-audit/commit/870b14b3dc83bb38853a0af62f1ff91d0f4ceb78>

To apply it, grab the two files from:
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Opmantek/open-audit/870b14b3dc83bb38853a0af62f1ff91d0f4ceb78/code_igniter/application/helpers/response_helper.php>
and
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Opmantek/open-audit/870b14b3dc83bb38853a0af62f1ff91d0f4ceb78/code_igniter/application/views/theme-bootstrap/v_template.php>

and replace the existing files in your installation.

Apologies for any inconvenience this causes. This has been patched and will be included in the next release.

Mark Unwin.
