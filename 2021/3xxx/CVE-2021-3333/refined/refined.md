- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A maliciously crafted SQL query, when outputted for debugging purposes, can trigger a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The vulnerability lies in the way SQL statements are displayed during debugging, without proper sanitization or encoding.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code through a crafted SQL query, which would then be executed within the context of the victim's browser when debugging is enabled, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.

- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious SQL query that includes malicious Javascript code, and this query must be output during a debugging session. A user must be logged into the application and click on a malicious link which will trigger the debug output.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious SQL query and get it to be executed. The attacker also requires the user to be logged in to Open-AudIT and click on a malicious link to trigger the debug output.
