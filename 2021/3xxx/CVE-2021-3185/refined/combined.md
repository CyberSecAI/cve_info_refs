| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1917192#c0)  Wade Mealing    2021-01-18 00:08:56 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the gstreamer parsing code in the function gst_h264_slice_parse_dec_ref_pic_marking.  An attacker able to trigger this section of code can cause a buffer overflow possibly overflowing the element on the stack leading to memory corruption.  Upstream fix: <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-bad/-/commit/11353b3f6e2f047cc37483d21e6a37ae558896bc>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1917192#c10)  Wade Mealing    2021-01-20 02:41:56 UTC  ``` Created gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1918094](show_bug.cgi?id=1918094 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2021-3185 gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free: gstreamer: buffer overflow in gst_h264_slice_parse_dec_ref_pic_marking [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |
