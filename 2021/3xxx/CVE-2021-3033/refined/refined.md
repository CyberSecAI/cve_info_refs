- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper verification of cryptographic signature during SAML authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of cryptographic signatures in SAML authentication. This allows an attacker to bypass the signature validation process.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass SAML authentication and log in to the Prisma Cloud Compute console as any authorized user. This grants them unauthorized access, potentially leading to data breaches, configuration changes, and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based and occurs via the SAML authentication process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction. They need to be able to send network requests to the Prisma Cloud Compute console.
