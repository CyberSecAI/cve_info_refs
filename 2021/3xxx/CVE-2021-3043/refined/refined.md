- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Prisma Cloud Compute web console.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser-based web console while an authenticated administrator is using that web interface. This can lead to confidentiality, integrity and availability impact.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack. The attacker crafts a malicious URL that, when clicked by the victim, executes arbitrary Javascript within the web browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated administrator into clicking a crafted URL to trigger the vulnerability.
