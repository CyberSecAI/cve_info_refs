Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3328:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way Abyss Web Server parses the "If-Modified-Since" header in HTTP requests. Specifically, a long sequence of slashes (/) in the header can trigger a crash due to an out-of-bounds read during parsing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Sending a specially crafted HTTP request with a large number of slashes in the "If-Modified-Since" header leads to an access violation and causes the web server to crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Service Disruption:** Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service condition, making the web server unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack is performed over the network by sending a malicious HTTP request to the targeted server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable Abyss Web Server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided crash details show an access violation (code c0000005) at the memory address `00000000004807db` within `abyssws.exe`. The instruction `mov al,byte ptr [rsi+1]` attempts to read a byte from an address that is out of bounds, resulting in the crash.
- The proof of concept (PoC) code demonstrates how to trigger the crash by sending an HTTP GET request with many slashes in both the URL and the "If-Modified-Since" header.

**Additional Notes**
- The blog post mentions that the bug is not exploitable for purposes other than denial of service.
- The vendor was informed, and a patch was expected.
