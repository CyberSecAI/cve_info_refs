ipf: release unhandled packets from the batch

Since [640d4db](https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/commit/640d4db788eda96bb904abcfc7de2327107bafe1) ("ipf: Fix a use-after-free error, ...") the ipf
framework unconditionally allocates a new dp_packet to track
individual fragments.  This prevents a use-after-free.  However, an
additional issue was present - even when the packet buffer is cloned,
if the ip fragment handling code keeps it, the original buffer is
leaked during the refill loop.  Even in the original processing code,
the hardcoded dnsteal branches would always leak a packet buffer from
the refill loop.

This can be confirmed with valgrind:

==717566== 16,672 (4,480 direct, 12,192 indirect) bytes in 8 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 390 of 390
==717566==    at 0x484086F: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:380)

==717566==    by 0x406E6C: main (ovs-vswitchd.c:127)

The fix is to delete the original packet when it isn't able to be
reinserted into the packet batch.  Subsequent valgrind runs show that
the packets are not leaked from the batch any longer.

| Hi,  This commit introduce a mempool memleak. [640d4db788eda96bb904abcfc7de2327107bafe1](https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/commit/640d4db788eda96bb904abcfc7de2327107bafe1)  If I keep sending first fragment as an attack, the mempool would be exhausted.  I think revert it and respect the dnsteal flag as @ Wang Liang mentioned in <https://mail.openvswitch.org/pipermail/ovs-dev/2021-April/382098.html> would be better.  ``` frag->pkt = dnsteal ? dp_packet_clone(pkt) : pkt;  ``` |

| No - this leak looks to be a different issue - the ipf expiry timer is taking extremely long to kick in. There is a purge timer, and it should be running at 15s to purge the free list. However, look at what happens:  2021-09-29T17:41:07.491Z|00093|unixctl|DBG|replying with success, id=0: " Fragmentation Module Status --------------------------- v4 enabled: 1 v6 enabled: 1 max num frags (v4/v6): 1000 num frag: 1 min v4 frag size: 1200 v4 frags accepted: 13 v4 frags completed: 12 v4 frags expired: 0 v4 frags too small: 0 v4 frags overlapped: 0 v4 frags purged: 0 min v6 frag size: 1280 v6 frags accepted: 0 v6 frags completed: 0 v6 frags expired: 0 v6 frags too small: 0 v6 frags overlapped: 0 v6 frags purged: 0  Almost 1m later: 2021-09-29T17:42:04.762Z|00111|unixctl|DBG|replying with success, id=0: " Fragmentation Module Status --------------------------- v4 enabled: 1 v6 enabled: 1 max num frags (v4/v6): 1000 num frag: 1 min v4 frag size: 1200 v4 frags accepted: 13 v4 frags completed: 12 v4 frags expired: 0 v4 frags too small: 0 v4 frags overlapped: 0 v4 frags purged: 0 min v6 frag size: 1280 v6 frags accepted: 0 v6 frags completed: 0 v6 frags expired: 0 v6 frags too small: 0 v6 frags overlapped: 0 v6 frags purged: 0  Finally purged: 2021-09-29T17:43:32.555Z|00113|unixctl|DBG|replying with success, id=0: " Fragmentation Module Status --------------------------- v4 enabled: 1 v6 enabled: 1 max num frags (v4/v6): 1000 num frag: 0 min v4 frag size: 1200 v4 frags accepted: 13 v4 frags completed: 12 v4 frags expired: 0 v4 frags too small: 0 v4 frags overlapped: 0 v4 frags purged: 1 min v6 frag size: 1280 v6 frags accepted: 0 v6 frags completed: 0 v6 frags expired: 0 v6 frags too small: 0 v6 frags overlapped: 0 v6 frags purged: 0  Even worse, this timer is not user configurable - so the only way to fix is to adjust the code. I suspect that you see it look worse because now we clone a packet, so under high packet conditions, we hold even bigger buffers for frags. This isn't a leak, but it is a problem (you should see after quiescent period, the number of outstanding frags should go down).  I will look into the purge timeout - it isn't configurable by the user and that would help here as well. |

| No. I did another test which use iperf to send udp packet over 2000 bytes. My vm's MTU is 1500.  ``` iperf -c 192.168.0.3 -u -i 1 -l 2000  ```  After a while all frags have be completed.  ```        Fragmentation Module Status         ---------------------------         v4 enabled: 1         v6 enabled: 1         max num frags (v4/v6): 1000         num frag: 0         min v4 frag size: 1200         v4 frags accepted: 3960         v4 frags completed: 3960         v4 frags expired: 0         v4 frags too small: 0         v4 frags overlapped: 0         v4 frags purged: 0         min v6 frag size: 1280         v6 frags accepted: 0         v6 frags completed: 0         v6 frags expired: 0         v6 frags too small: 0         v6 frags overlapped: 0         v6 frags purged: 0  ```  But the mempool did not get released. This can be confirmed using `dpdkprocinfo`  ``` ./dpdk-proc-info -a 0000:17:00.0 --file-prefix=`pidof ovs-vswitchd`- -- --show-mempool=ovsd78f4ce801021580262144  ```  And the result is like  ``` EAL: No legacy callbacks, legacy socket not created ========== show - MEMPOOL ==========   - Name: ovsd78f4ce801021580262144 on socket 1   - flags: 	  -- No spread (n) 	  -- No cache align (n) 	  -- SP put (n), SC get (n) 	  -- Pool created (y) 	  -- No IOVA config (n)   - Size 262144 Cache 512 element 2880   - header 64 trailer 64   - private data size 64   - memezone - socket 1   - Count: avail (258196), in use (3948)   - ops_index 1 ops_name ring_mp_mc  ```  The `in use` numbers increased as packets send out. And eventually it reached total size. |

| Note - I applied this to a pre-liang version of the code, because it seems this leak has been present for a very long time (and is independent of the dnsteal flag - it is a completely missed branch and would happen anyway). |

`[ipf: release unhandled packets from the batch](/ovsrobot/ovs/commit/201fd933e9287ee7db2ef73938b71dfdb2c15c75 "ipf: release unhandled packets from the batch

Since 640d4db788ed (\"ipf: Fix a use-after-free error, ...\") the ipf
framework unconditionally allocates a new dp_packet to track
individual fragments.  This prevents a use-after-free.  However, an
additional issue was present - even when the packet buffer is cloned,
if the ip fragment handling code keeps it, the original buffer is
leaked during the refill loop.  Even in the original processing code,
the hardcoded dnsteal branches would always leak a packet buffer from
the refill loop.

This can be confirmed with valgrind:

`[ipf: release unhandled packets from the batch](/openvswitch/ovs/commit/39c4269a080d16f9c60f0c504d73f994b08fce3b "ipf: release unhandled packets from the batch

Since 640d4db788ed (\"ipf: Fix a use-after-free error, ...\") the ipf
framework unconditionally allocates a new dp_packet to track
individual fragments.  This prevents a use-after-free.  However, an
additional issue was present - even when the packet buffer is cloned,
if the ip fragment handling code keeps it, the original buffer is
leaked during the refill loop.  Even in the original processing code,
the hardcoded dnsteal branches would always leak a packet buffer from
the refill loop.

This can be confirmed with valgrind:

`[ipf: release unhandled packets from the batch](/openvswitch/ovs/commit/9efa2ea619e563f7ec70c93e4eefb4b96cdfd7d4 "ipf: release unhandled packets from the batch

Since 640d4db788ed (\"ipf: Fix a use-after-free error, ...\") the ipf
framework unconditionally allocates a new dp_packet to track
individual fragments.  This prevents a use-after-free.  However, an
additional issue was present - even when the packet buffer is cloned,
if the ip fragment handling code keeps it, the original buffer is
leaked during the refill loop.  Even in the original processing code,
the hardcoded dnsteal branches would always leak a packet buffer from
the refill loop.

This can be confirmed with valgrind:

==717566== 16,672 (4,480 direct, 12,192 indirect) bytes in 8 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 390 of 390

==717566==    by 0x406E6C: main (ovs-vswitchd.c:127)

The fix is to delete the original packet when it isn't able to be
reinserted into the packet batch.  Subsequent valgrind runs show that
the packets are not leaked from the batch any longer.
