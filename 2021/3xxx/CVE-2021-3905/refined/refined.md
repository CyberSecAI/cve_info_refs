Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-3905:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A memory leak occurs in Open vSwitch (OVS) during userspace IP fragmentation processing.
- The issue stems from how OVS handles packet buffers when IP fragments cannot be reinserted into a packet batch after processing.
- Specifically, after commit `640d4db` a new `dp_packet` is allocated to track individual fragments, but if the fragment handling code keeps it, the original buffer is leaked during the refill loop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:**  Packet buffers are not released correctly when fragmented packets are processed, leading to a memory leak.
- The code path where the original packet was not deleted was a missed branch in the `ipf_extract_frags_from_batch` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker can potentially exhaust available memory by repeatedly sending fragmented packets. This can lead to OVS crashing or becoming unresponsive.
- The memory leak will cause the mempool to be exhausted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending fragmented IP packets to an Open vSwitch instance.
- Exploitation can be triggered remotely by sending specially crafted fragmented packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network connectivity to the OVS instance.
- Ability to send fragmented IP packets.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists because the code did not properly delete the original packet when it was not reinserted into the batch.
- The issue is not related to the `dnsteal` flag.
- The fix involves deleting the original packet when it can't be reinserted into the packet batch.
