Obenour.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1927741#c5)  Todd Cullum    2021-02-18 19:30:47 UTC  ``` Upstream PR: <https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/pull/1500>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1927741#c7)  Panu Matilainen    2021-02-24 08:12:23 UTC  ``` This only affects headerCheck(), which is only intended for and used on headers coming from the rpmdb by any of the standard tooling, and I'm not aware of any non-standard tooling using it either. A caller can of course toss any memory address at it (including a malicious header mmap()'ed from a package on disk) in which case the missing checks could hurt but that's not the expected usage.  So to exploit this in practise, an attacker needs to be able to modify the rpmdb. At that point there are bigger problems.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1927741#c10)  Panu Matilainen    2021-03-09 09:51:10 UTC  ``` Okay, this "affects" headerImport() in addition to headerCheck(), somehow missed/mixed that up. Not that it makes any particular difference for the severity: both are used on an in-memory serialized header, which only happens for packages coming from the rpmdb in the rpm stack (other arbitrary API users could do different things of course).  I have to say I'm doubtful this is worth the fuss. Adding those checks upstream makes makes sense but beyond that it seems a bit meh: these API's are unsafe by design as they don't require caller to specify the blob size, and no amount of added checking will help with that. The limits imposed by the existing checks are completely arbitrary anyway, except perhaps for negative values and overflow, in which case ... I don't know what happens. Perhaps I should do some concrete testing with this.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1927741#c11)  Panu Matilainen    2021-03-09 10:09:35 UTC  ``` Also you don't actually need any particular mitigation against this, normal package read/query/install etc are NOT affected.  For this to affect standard tooling one needs to be able to directly manipulate the rpmdb contents, which requires root privileges. So a mitigation would essentially amount to: "Do not give root access to untrusted parties"...  3rd party / in-house software relying on these functions could be different, but there's little reason for anybody to use these on completely untrusted headers as headers do not wander around alone, they come in via packages and that route is covered by existing checks.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1927741#c12)  Todd Cullum    2021-03-11 23:02:57 UTC  ``` Created rpm tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1938022](show_bug.cgi?id=1938022 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2021-20266 rpm: missing length checks in hdrblobInit() [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1927741#c13)  Todd Cullum    2021-03-12 19:25:04 UTC  ``` Statement:  In order to exploit this flaw with rpm tooling as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, an attacker would need to already have root access to modify the rpm database.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1927741#c14)  Todd Cullum    2021-03-12 19:25:05 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  If using the headerCheck() and headerImport() APIs in your software, do not run them on headers from untrusted sources.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1927741#c15)  Panu Matilainen    2021-03-15 10:17:24 UTC  ``` As an addendum: one should always pass the blob size ("uc" argument) to both headerCheck() and headerImport() - when used this way, and uc is large enough to hold at least the header intro, both functions are quite safe. If 0 (for unknown) is used, there's simply no way to make it safe. For the same reason, one should not use the deprecated headerLoad(), headerCopyLoad() and headerUnload() interfaces.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1927741#c16)  Todd Cullum    2021-03-19 20:29:37 UTC  ``` Upstream patch: <https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/commit/8f4b3c3cab8922a2022b9e47c71f1ecf906077ef>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1927741#c17)  Fedora Update System    2021-03-30 00:15:38 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2021-2383d950fd has been pushed to the Fedora 34 stable repository.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Be much more careful about copying data from the signature header

```
Only look for known tags, and ensure correct type and size where known
before copying over. Bump the old arbitrary 16k count limit to 16M limit
though, it's not inconceivable that a package could have that many files.
While at it, ensure none of these tags exist in the main header,
which would confuse us greatly.

This is optimized for backporting ease, upstream can remove redundancies
and further improve checking later.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1927747#c0)  msiddiqu    2021-02-11 13:14:34 UTC  ``` The signature header is not signed, but some data is extracted from it and incorporated into the RPM database.  It may be possible to insert an erroneous and/or malicious OpenPGP signature into a signed package this way. It is possible to inject strings into the RPM database that the owner of the database would not wish it to contain.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1927747#c1)  msiddiqu    2021-02-11 13:14:37 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Demi M. Obenour   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1927747#c7)  Todd Cullum    2021-03-02 18:05:12 UTC  ``` Created rpm tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1933867](show_bug.cgi?id=1933867 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2021-3421 rpm: unsigned signature header leads to string injection into an rpm database [fedora-33]")]   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1927747#c11)  Todd Cullum    2021-03-05 23:43:46 UTC  ``` Flaw summary:  rpmReadPackageFile() is used to read RPM file headers. Internally, it calls headerMergeLegacySigs() which copies signature tags from the signature header to the main RPM metadata header (especially, legacy signatures). The logic in headerMergeLegacySigs() allows for copying of unknown tags from the signature header into the RPM header. Thus, it's possible to supply an RPM file with an unknown tag in the signature header, that gets copied into the RPM metadata header and subsequently placed into the RPM database as a corrupt header tag if the package is installed. This occurs even with the %_pkgverify_level macro set to `all`.  Installing such a package causes the header to be inaccessible within the rpm database and could lead to data integrity issues such as corrupt header and bad tag errors when rpm reads the database, installed packages not actually being retrievable (shown as not installed), seemingly missing dependencies that are actually installed, etc...  This flaw does not cause data loss or permanent damage to the database, which can be repaired using the `rpmdb --rebuilddb` or `rpm --rebuilddb` commands.  Additionally, it requires running rpm against a malicious or malformed package which should never be in the official supported package repositories - so a Man-in-the-middle or attempting to install an unsupported or modified package would be required to trigger this.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1927747#c12)  Todd Cullum    2021-03-05 23:46:14 UTC  ``` Statement:  To exploit this flaw, an attacker must either compromise an RPM repository or convince an administrator to install an untrusted RPM.  It is strongly recommended to only use RPMs from trusted repositories.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1927747#c13)  Todd Cullum    2021-03-11 23:07:55 UTC  ``` Created rpm tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-32 [[bug 1938024](show_bug.cgi?id=1938024 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2021-3421 rpm: unsigned signature header leads to string injection into an rpm database [fedora-32]")] Affects: fedora-rawhide [[bug 1938025](show_bug.cgi?id=1938025 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2021-3421 rpm: unsigned signature header leads to string injection into an rpm database [fedora-rawhide]")]   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1927747#c14)  Todd Cullum    2021-03-19 20:26:18 UTC  ``` Upstream patch: <https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/commit/d6a86b5e69e46cc283b1e06c92343319beb42e21>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1927747#c15)  Fedora Update System    2021-03-30 00:15:42 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2021-2383d950fd has been pushed to the Fedora 34 stable repository.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
