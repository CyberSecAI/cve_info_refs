# [The short story of broken KRETPROBES and OPTIMIZER in Linux Kernel](http://blog.pi3.com.pl/?p=831)

by pi3

**The short story of broken KRETPROBES and OPTIMIZER in Linux Kernel.**

During the LKRG development process I‚Äôve found that:

* KRETPROBES are broken since kernel 5.8 (fixed in upcoming kernel)
* OPTIMIZER was not doing sufficient job since kernel 5.5

**First things first ‚Äì KPROBES and FTRACE:**

Linux kernel provides 2 amazing frameworks for hooking ‚Äì K\*ROBES and FTRACE. K\*PROBES is older and a classic one ‚Äì introduced in 2.6.9 (October 2004). However, FTRACE is a newer interface and might have smaller overhead comparing to K\*PROBES. I‚Äôm using a word ‚ÄúK\*PROBES‚Äù because various types of K\*PROBES were availble in the kernel, including JPROBES, KRETPROBES or classic KPROBES. K\*PROBES essentially enables the possibility to dynamically break into any kernel routine. What are the differences between various K\*PROBES?

* KPROBES ‚Äì can be placed on virtually any instruction in the kernel
* JPROBES ‚Äì were implemented using KPROBES. The main idea behind JPROBES was to employ a simple mirroring principle to allow seamless access to the probed function‚Äôs arguments. However, since 2017 JPROBEs were depreciated. More information can be found here:
  <https://lwn.net/Articles/735667/>
* KRETPROBES ‚Äì sometimes they are called ‚Äúreturn probes‚Äù and they also use KPROBES under-the-hood. KRETPROBES allows to easily execute user‚Äôs own routine at the entry and return path to the hooked function.However, KRETPROBES can‚Äôt be placed on arbitrary instructions.

When a KPROBE is registered, it makes a copy of the probed instruction and replaces the first byte(s) of the probed instruction with a breakpoint instruction (e.g., int3 on i386 and x86\_64).

FTRACE are newer comparing to K\*PROBES and were initially introduced in kernel 2.6.27, which was released on October 9, 2008. FTRACE works completely differently and the main idea is based on instrumenting every compiled function (injecting a ‚Äúlong-NOP‚Äù instruction ‚Äì GCC‚Äôs option ‚Äú-pg‚Äù). When FTRACE is being registered on the specific function, such ‚Äúlong-NOP‚Äù is being replaced with JUMP instruction which points to the trampoline code. Later such trampoline can execute any pre-registered user-defined hook.

**A few words about Linux Kernel Runtime Guard (LKRG)**

In short, LKRG performs runtime integrity checking of the Linux kernel (similar to [PatchGuard technology from Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_Patch_Protection)) and detection of the various exploits against the kernel. LKRG attempts to post-detect and promptly respond to unauthorized modifications to the running Linux kernel (system integrity) or to corruption of the task integrity such as credentials (user/group IDs), SECCOMP/sandbox rules, namespaces, and more.
To be able to implement such functionality, LKRG must place various hooks in the kernel. KRETPROBES are used to fulfill that requirement.

**LKRG‚Äôs KPROBE on FTRACE instrumented functions**

A careful reader might ask an interesting question: what will happen if the function is instrumented by the FTRACE (injected ‚Äúlong-NOP‚Äù) and someone registers K\*PROBES on it? Does dynamically registered FTRACE ‚Äúoverwrite‚Äù K\*PROBES installed on that function and vice versa?

Well, this is a very common situation from LKRG‚Äôs perspective, since it is placing KRETPROBES on many syscalls. Linux kernel uses a special type of K\*PROBES in such case and it is called ‚ÄúFTRACE-based KPROBES‚Äù. Essentially, such special KPROBE is using FTRACE infrastructure and has very little to do with KPROBES itself. That‚Äôs interesting because it is also subject to FTRACE rules e.g. if you disable FTRACE infrastructure, such special KPROBE won‚Äôt work either.

**OPTIMIZER**

Linux kernel developers went one step forward and they aggressively ‚Äúoptimize‚Äù all K\*PROBES to use FTRACE instead. The main reason behind that is performance ‚Äì FTRACE has smaller overhead. If for any reason such KPROBE can‚Äôt be optimized, then classic old-school KPROBES infrastructure is used.

When you analyze all KRETPROBES placed by LKRG, you will realize that on modern kernels all of them are being converted to some type of FTRACE üôÇ

**LKRG reports False Positives**

After such a long introduction finally, we can move on to the topic of this article. Vitaly Chikunov from ALT Linux reported that when he runs FTRACE stress tester, LKRG reports corruption of .text section:

<https://github.com/openwall/lkrg/issues/12>

I spent a few weeks (month+) on making LKRG detect and accept authorized third-party modifications to the kernel‚Äôs code placed via FTRACE. When I finally finished that work, I realized that additionally, I need to protect the global FTRACE knob (*sysctl kernel.ftrace\_enabled*), which allows root to completely disable FTRACE on a running system. Otherwise, LKRG‚Äôs hooks might be unknowingly disabled, which not only disables its protections (kind of OK under a threat model where we trust host root), but may also lead to false positives (as without the hooks LKRG wouldn‚Äôt know which modifications are legitimate). I‚Äôve added that functionality, and everything was working fine‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶ until kernel 5.9. This completely surprised me. I‚Äôve not seen any significant changes between 5.8.x and 5.9.x in FTRACE logic. I spent some time on that and finally I realized that my protection of global FTRACE knob stopped working on latest kernels (since 5.9). However, this code was not changed between kernel 5.8.x and 5.9.x. What‚Äôs the mystery?

**First problem ‚Äì KRETPROBES are broken.**

Starting from kernel 5.8 all non-optimized KRETPROBES don‚Äôt work. Until 5.8, when #DB exception was raised, entry to the NMI was not fully performed. Among others, the following logic was executed:
<https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.7.19/source/arch/x86/kernel/traps.c#L589>

```
if (!user_mode(regs)) {
    rcu_nmi_enter();
    preempt_disable();
}
```

In some older kernels function *ist\_enter()* was called instead. Inside this function we can see the following logic:
<https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.7.19/source/arch/x86/kernel/traps.c#L91>

```
if (user_mode(regs)) {
    RCU_LOCKDEP_WARN(!rcu_is_watching(), "entry code didn't wake RCU");
} else {
    /*
     * We might have interrupted pretty much anything.  In
     * fact, if we're a machine check, we can even interrupt
     * NMI processing.  We don't want in_nmi() to return true,
     * but we need to notify RCU.
     */
    rcu_nmi_enter();
}

preempt_disable();
```

As the comment says ‚Äú*We don‚Äôt want in\_nmi() to return true, but we need to notify RCU.*‚Äú. However, since kernel 5.8 the logic of how interrupts are handled was modified and currently we have this (function ‚Äú*exc\_int3*‚Äú):
<https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.8/source/arch/x86/kernel/traps.c#L630>

```
/*
 * idtentry_enter_user() uses static_branch_{,un}likely() and therefore
 * can trigger INT3, hence poke_int3_handler() must be done
 * before. If the entry came from kernel mode, then use nmi_enter()
 * because the INT3 could have been hit in any context including
 * NMI.
 */
if (user_mode(regs)) {
    idtentry_enter_user(regs);
    instrumentation_begin();
    do_int3_user(regs);
    instrumentation_end();
    idtentry_exit_user(regs);
} else {
    nmi_enter();
    instrumentation_begin();
    trace_hardirqs_off_finish();
    if (!do_int3(regs))
        die("int3", regs, 0);
    if (regs->flags & X86_EFLAGS_IF)
        trace_hardirqs_on_prepare();
    instrumentation_end();
    nmi_exit();
}
```

The root of unlucky change comes from this commit:

<https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/0d00449c7a28a1514595630735df383dec606812#diff-51ce909c2f65ed9cc668bc36cc3c18528541d8a10e84287874cd37a5918abae5>

which was later modified by this commit:

<https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/8edd7e37aed8b9df938a63f0b0259c70569ce3d2>

and this is what we currently have in all kernels since 5.8. Essentially, KRETPROBES are not working since these commits. We have the following logic:

```
asm_exc_int3() -> exc_int3():
                    |
    ----------------|
    |
    v
...
nmi_enter();
...
if (!do_int3(regs))
       |
  -----|
  |
  v
do_int3() -> kprobe_int3_handler():
                    |
    ----------------|
    |
    v
...
if (!p->pre_handler || !p->pre_handler(p, regs))
                             |
    -------------------------|
    |
    v
...
pre_handler_kretprobe():
...
    if (unlikely(in_nmi())) {
        rp->nmissed++;
        return 0;
    }
```

Essentially, *exc\_int3()* calls *nmi\_enter()*, and *pre\_handler\_kretprobe()* before invoking any registered KPROBE verifies if it is not in NMI via *in\_nmi()* call.

I‚Äôve reported this issue to the maintainers and it was addressed and correctly fixed. These patches are going to be backported to the stable tree (and hopefully to LTS kernels as well):

<https://lists.openwall.net/linux-kernel/2020/12/09/1313>

However, coming back to the original problem with LKRG‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt see any issues with kernel 5.8.x but with 5.9.x. It‚Äôs interesting because KRETPROBES were broken in 5.8.x as well. So what‚Äôs going on?

As I mentioned at the beginning of the article, K\*PROBES are aggressively optimized and converted to FTRACE. In kernel 5.8.x LKRG‚Äôs hook was correctly optimized and didn‚Äôt use KRETPROBES at all. That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt see any problems with this version. However, for some reasons, such optimization was not possible in kernel 5.9.x. This results in placing classic non-optimized KRETPROBES which we know is broken.

**Second problem ‚Äì OPTIMIZER isn‚Äôt doing sufficient job anymore.**

I didn‚Äôt see any changes in the sources regarding the OPTIMIZER, neither in the hooked function itself. However, when I looked at the generated vmlinux binary, I saw that GCC generated a padding at the end of the hooked function using INT3 opcode:

```
...
ffffffff8130528b:       41 bd f0 ff ff ff       mov    $0xfffffff0,%r13d
ffffffff81305291:       e9 fe fe ff ff          jmpq   ffffffff81305194
ffffffff81305296:       cc                      int3
ffffffff81305297:       cc                      int3
ffffffff81305298:       cc                      int3
ffffffff81305299:       cc                      int3
ffffffff8130529a:       cc                      int3
ffffffff8130529b:       cc                      int3
ffffffff8130529c:       cc                      int3
ffffffff8130529d:       cc                      int3
ffffffff8130529e:       cc                      int3
ffffffff8130529f:       cc                      int3
```

Such padding didn‚Äôt exist in this function in generated images for older kernels. Nevertheless, such padding is pretty common.

OPTIMIZER logic fails here:

```
try_to_optimize_kprobe() -> alloc_aggr_kprobe() -> __prepare_optimized_kprobe()
-> arch_prepare_optimized_kprobe() -> can_optimize():
```
```
/* Decode instructions */
addr = paddr - offset;
while (addr < paddr - offset + size) { /* Decode until function end */
    unsigned long recovered_insn;
    if (search_exception_tables(addr))
        /*
         * Since some fixup code will jumps into this function,
         * we can't optimize kprobe in this function.
         */
        return 0;
    recovered_insn = recover_probed_instruction(buf, addr);
    if (!recovered_insn)
        return 0;
    kernel_insn_init(&insn, (void *)recovered_insn, MAX_INSN_SIZE);
    insn_get_length(&insn);
    /* Another subsystem puts a breakpoint */
    if (insn.opcode.bytes[0] == INT3_INSN_OPCODE)
        return 0;
    /* Recover address */
    insn.kaddr = (void *)addr;
    insn.next_byte = (void *)(addr + insn.length);
    /* Check any instructions don't jump into target */
    if (insn_is_indirect_jump(&insn) ||
        insn_jump_into_range(&insn, paddr + INT3_INSN_SIZE,
                 DISP32_SIZE))
        return 0;
    addr += insn.length;
}
```

One of the checks tries to protect from the situation when another subsystem puts a breakpoint there as well:

```
    /* Another subsystem puts a breakpoint */
    if (insn.opcode.bytes[0] == INT3_INSN_OPCODE)
        return 0;
```

However, that‚Äôs not the case here. INT3\_INSN\_OPCODE is placed at the end of the function as padding.
I wanted to find out why INT3 padding is more common in the new kernels while it‚Äôs not the case for older ones even though I‚Äôm using exactly the same compiler and linker. I‚Äôve started browsing commits and I‚Äôve found this one:
<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=7705dc8557973d8ad8f10840f61d8ec805695e9e>

```
diff --git a/arch/x86/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S b/arch/x86/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S
index b06d6e1188deb..3a1a819da1376 100644
--- a/arch/x86/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S

 #endif
-	} :text = 0x9090
+	} :text =0xcccc

 	/* End of text section, which should occupy whole number of pages */
 	_etext = .;
```

It looks like INT3 is now a default padding used by the linker.

I‚Äôve brought up that problem with the Linux kernel developers (KPROBES owners), and Masami Hiramatsu prepared appropriate patch which fixes the problem:

<https://lists.openwall.net/linux-kernel/2020/12/11/265>

I‚Äôve verified it and now it works well. Thanks to LKRG development work we helped identify and fix two interesting problems in Linux kernel üôÇ

Thanks,
Adam
