  "cveId": "CVE-2021-3962",
  "related": true,
  "info": "The provided content describes a heap-use-after-free vulnerability in ImageMagick's `dcm.c` file, specifically within the `RelinquishDCMMemory` function. This aligns with the CVE description which mentions 'heap-use-after-free in at dcm.c RelinquishDCMMemory'.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from a double free condition in the `RelinquishDCMMemory` function. Memory allocated for DICOM image processing is being freed twice, leading to a use-after-free condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-use-after-free",
      "Double free"
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a crash, potentially allowing an attacker to cause a denial of service. It could also have further impacts depending on the context, such as arbitrary code execution.",
    "attackVectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted DICOM image file via the `convert` utility of ImageMagick.",
    "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted DICOM image to an application using ImageMagick, specifically version 7.1.0-14. The attacker needs no special privileges, just the ability to provide the crafted image as input."
  },
    "additionalDetails": {
       "fixedVersion": "The vulnerability was fixed in ImageMagick version 7.1.0-15. The fix involved moving a free operation to the correct position in the code.",
      "affectedComponent": "coders/dcm.c",
      "reproductionSteps": "The vulnerability can be reproduced by building ImageMagick with the `--disable-shared` option, then running the `magick convert -adjoin -alpha copy -antialias -append -auto-gamma -auto-level -auto-orient poc /dev/null` command using the provided `poc.zip` file as the input `poc`."
