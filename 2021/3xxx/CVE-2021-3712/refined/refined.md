Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability detailed in CVE-2021-3712:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way OpenSSL handles ASN.1 strings. Unlike standard C strings that are null-terminated, ASN.1 strings are represented by an `ASN1_STRING` structure containing a buffer for the string data and a separate field for the buffer length. While OpenSSL's parsing functions (like `d2i`) and `ASN1_STRING_set()` typically null-terminate these string buffers, it's possible for applications to construct `ASN1_STRING` structures directly without null termination, using functions like `ASN1_STRING_set0()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Read Buffer Overrun:** Several OpenSSL functions that process ASN.1 data assume that the `ASN1_STRING` buffers are null-terminated, which may not be the case with application-constructed strings. When these functions operate on non-null-terminated strings, they can read beyond the intended buffer boundary.
-  **Lack of Null-Termination Guarantee:** The core issue is that OpenSSL doesn't enforce null-termination for all `ASN1_STRING` structures, allowing malformed data to bypass expected checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Read buffer overruns can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Information Disclosure:** Overruns could potentially lead to the disclosure of sensitive private memory contents, such as private keys or plaintext data.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious ASN.1 String Construction:** An attacker crafts an ASN.1 string without null termination and provides this as input.
-   **Exploitation of Affected OpenSSL Functions:** The attacker needs to trigger the vulnerability by causing the application to process the malformed `ASN1_STRING` using one of the vulnerable OpenSSL functions such as those that print or processes ASN.1 data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Influence Application Input:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the data that the application processes. This could be through a network interface, file input, or by other means depending on the affected application.
- **Application-Specific Trigger:** The attacker must induce the application to use an affected function (e.g., a function that prints ASN.1 data or handles certificate constraints).

**Additional details from the provided documents:**

*   The vulnerability is present in OpenSSL versions 1.1.1k and below and OpenSSL 1.0.2y and below.
*   The fixes are available in OpenSSL 1.1.1l and OpenSSL 1.0.2za, respectively.
* The vulnerable functions are not limited to `X509_aux_print()` but also include `X509_get1_email()`, `X509_REQ_get1_email()`, and `X509_get1_ocsp()`.
*  The vulnerability can occur during name constraint processing of certificates that have not been properly created by OpenSSL functions.
*   This vulnerability is considered "Moderate" in severity by OpenSSL, but Tenable rated as “High”
* Debian also issued DSA-4963-1 and DLA-2766-1 to address the issue
* Siemens issued advisory SSA-244969, and mentions that this vulnerability could lead to a denial of service or disclose private memory content.
* Oracle also included this vulnerability in their April 2022 Critical Patch Update Advisory where it is listed to affect many of their products.

In summary, CVE-2021-3712 is a moderate severity read buffer overrun vulnerability in OpenSSL caused by a failure to enforce null-termination on all ASN.1 strings, which can lead to crashes and information disclosure if exploited. The primary attack vector is manipulating input to cause the OpenSSL library to use the vulnerable function while processing crafted, non-null-terminated ASN.1 strings.
