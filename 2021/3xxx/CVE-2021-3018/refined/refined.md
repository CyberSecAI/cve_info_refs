Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-3018:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL Injection (SQLi) flaw. Specifically, it is a Boolean-based blind SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the `print.php` script of IPeakCMS version 3.5, allowing for SQL injection.
- The injection is blind, which means the attacker does not directly see the results of their queries, but can infer the output by observing changes in the application's behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to potentially access sensitive information from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the `site.com/cms/print.php` endpoint.
- The injection type is Boolean-based blind SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send requests to the vulnerable `print.php` endpoint.
-  The attacker can use SQL injection tools to automate the exploitation. In this case, the attacker used SQLmap version 1.3.2.
