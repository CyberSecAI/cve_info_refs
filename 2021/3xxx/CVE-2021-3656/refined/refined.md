  "CVE-2021-3656": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the \"virt_ext\" field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to disable both VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts and VLS (Virtual VMLOAD/VMSAVE) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape.",
    "Root cause": "Improper validation of the `virt_ext` field in the VMCB, leading to missing intercepts of VMLOAD/VMSAVE instructions",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing validation of VMCB fields",
	  "Incorrect handling of VMLOAD/VMSAVE instructions in nested virtualization"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious L1 guest could cause the L2 guest to read/write portions of the host physical memory, leading to system compromise, data leaks, or guest-to-host escape.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A malicious L1 guest disables VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts and VLS in the VMCB it provides for a nested L2 guest."
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "Ability to control the L1 guest, and therefore the VMCB provided to create a L2 guest."
