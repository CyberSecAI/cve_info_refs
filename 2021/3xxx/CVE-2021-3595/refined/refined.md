{
  "CVE-2021-3595": {
    "Root cause": "An invalid pointer initialization issue in the tftp_input() function within the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU.",
    "Weaknesses": "The code does not properly validate the size of an incoming UDP packet before processing it as a TFTP packet. If the packet is smaller than the expected header size ('tftp_t' structure), an out-of-bounds read can occur.",
    "Impact": "An out-of-bounds read access or indirect host memory disclosure to the guest.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious guest can send a crafted UDP packet (TFTP) that is smaller than the expected header size.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a malicious guest capable of sending network traffic."
  }
