Debian Bug     : 988044 989285 990411 994050

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2020-29374

    Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
    management.  A parent and child process initially share all their
    memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
    duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write).  However, in case an
    operation such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an
    additional reference to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs
    during this operation, the kernel might have accessed the wrong
    process's memory.  For some programs, this could lead to an
    information leak or data corruption.

    This issue was already fixed for most architectures, but not on
    MIPS and System z.  This update corrects that.

CVE-2020-36322, CVE-2021-28950

    The syzbot tool found that the FUSE (filesystem-in-user-space)
    implementation did not correctly handle a FUSE server returning
    invalid attributes for a file.  A local user permitted to run a
    FUSE server could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    The original fix for this introduced a different potential denial
    of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has also been
    fixed.

CVE-2021-3640

    Lin Ma discovered a race condiiton in the Bluetooth protocol
    implementation that can lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3744, CVE-2021-3764

    minihanshen reported bugs in the ccp driver for AMD
    Cryptographic Coprocessors that could lead to a resource leak.
    On systems using this driver, a local user could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service.

CVE-2021-3752

    Likang Luo of NSFOCUS Security Team discovered a flaw in the
    Bluetooth L2CAP implementation that can lead to a user-after-free.
    A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3760, CVE-2021-4202

    Lin Ma discovered race conditions in the NCI (NFC Controller
    Interface) driver, which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-3772

    A flaw was found in the SCTP protocol implementation, which would
    allow a networked attacker to break an SCTP association.  The
    attacker would only need to know or guess the IP addresses and
    ports for the association.

CVE-2021-4002

    It was discovered that hugetlbfs, the virtual filesystem used by
    applications to allocate huge pages in RAM, did not flush the
    CPU's TLB in one case where it was necessary.  In some
    circumstances a local user would be able to read and write huge
    pages after they are freed and reallocated to a different process.
    This could lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or
    information leaks.

CVE-2021-4083

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the local (Unix) sockets
    garbage collector, that can lead to use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-4135

    A flaw was found in the netdevsim driver which would lead to an
    information leak.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-4155

    Kirill Tkhai discovered a data leak in the way the XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP
    IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for a size increase of files
    with unaligned size. A local attacker can take advantage of this
    flaw to leak data on the XFS filesystem.

CVE-2021-4203

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the local (Unix) sockets
    implementation that can lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this to leak sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2021-20317

    It was discovered that the timer queue structure could become
    corrupt, leading to waiting tasks never being woken up.  A local
    user with certain privileges could exploit this to cause a denial
    of service (system hang).

CVE-2021-20321

    A race condition was discovered in the overlayfs filesystem
    driver.  A local user with access to an overlayfs mount and to its
    underlying upper directory could exploit this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-20322

    An information leak was discovered in the IPv4 implementation.  A
    remote attacker could exploit this to quickly discover which UDP
    ports a system is using, making it easier for them to carry out a
    DNS poisoning attack against that system.

CVE-2021-22600

    The syzbot tool found a flaw in the packet socket (AF_PACKET)
    implementation which could lead to incorrectly freeing memory.  A
    local user with CAP_NET_RAW capability (in any user namespace)
    could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713 (XSA-391)

    Juergen Gross reported that malicious PV backends can cause a denial
    of service to guests being serviced by those backends via high
    frequency events, even if those backends are running in a less
    privileged environment.

CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715 (XSA-392)

    Juergen Gross discovered that Xen guests can force the Linux
    netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory, resulting in
    denial of service.

CVE-2021-38300

    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a flaw in the classic BPF (cBPF) JIT
    compiler for MIPS architectures.  A local user could exploit
    this to excute arbitrary code in the kernel.

    This issue is mitigated by setting sysctl
    net.core.bpf_jit_enable=0, which is the default.  It is *not*
    mitigated by disabling unprivileged use of eBPF.

CVE-2021-39685

    Szymon Heidrich discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the
    USB gadget subsystem, resulting in information disclosure, denial of
    service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-39686

    A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, that
    could lead to incorrect security checks.  On systems where the
    binder driver is loaded, a local user could exploit this for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-39698

    Linus Torvalds reported a flaw in the file polling implementation,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user could exploit
    this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-39713

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling
    subsystem which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-41864

    An integer overflow was discovered in the Extended BPF (eBPF)
    subsystem.  A local user could exploit this for denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

    This can be mitigated by setting sysctl
    kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1, which disables eBPF use by
    unprivileged users.

CVE-2021-42739

    A heap buffer overflow was discovered in the firedtv driver for
    FireWire-connected DVB receivers.  A local user with access to a
    firedtv device could exploit this for denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-43389

    The Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a flaw in the CMTP
    subsystem as used by Bluetooth, which could lead to an
    out-of-bounds read and object type confusion.  A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in the initial user namespace could
    exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash),
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-43975

    Brendan Dolan-Gavitt reported a flaw in the
    hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait() function in the aQuantia AQtion ethernet
    device driver which can result in denial of service or the execution
    of arbitrary code.

CVE-2021-43976

    Zekun Shen and Brendan Dolan-Gavitt discovered a flaw in the
    mwifiex_usb_recv() function of the Marvell WiFi-Ex USB Driver. An
    attacker able to connect a crafted USB device can take advantage of
    this flaw to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2021-44733

    A race condition was discovered in the Trusted Execution
    Environment (TEE) subsystem for Arm processors, which could lead
    to a use-after-free.  A local user permitted to access a TEE
    device could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-45095

    It was discovered that the Phone Network protocol (PhoNet) driver
    has a reference count leak in the pep_sock_accept() function.

CVE-2021-45469

    Wenqing Liu reported an out-of-bounds memory access in the f2fs
    implementation if an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. An
    attacker able to mount a specially crafted image can take advantage
    of this flaw for denial of service.

CVE-2021-45480

    A memory leak flaw was discovered in the __rds_conn_create()
    function in the RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) protocol subsystem.

CVE-2022-0001 (INTEL-SA-00598)

    Researchers at VUSec discovered that the Branch History Buffer in
    Intel processors can be exploited to create information side-
    channels with speculative execution.  This issue is similar to
    Spectre variant 2, but requires additional mitigations on some
    processors.

    This can be exploited to obtain sensitive information from a
    different security context, such as from user-space to the kernel,
    or from a KVM guest to the kernel.

CVE-2022-0002 (INTEL-SA-00598)

    This is a similar issue to CVE-2022-0001, but covers exploitation
    within a security context, such as from JIT-compiled code in a
    sandbox to hosting code in the same process.

    This can be partly mitigated by disabling eBPF for unprivileged
    users with the sysctl: kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=2.  This
    update does that by default.

CVE-2022-0322

    Eiichi Tsukata discovered a flaw in the sctp_make_strreset_req()
    function in the SCTP network protocol implementation which can
    result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-0330

    Sushma Venkatesh Reddy discovered a missing GPU TLB flush in the
    i915 driver, resulting in denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-0435

    Samuel Page and Eric Dumazet reported a stack overflow in the
    networking module for the Transparent Inter-Process Communication
    (TIPC) protocol, resulting in denial of service or potentially the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2022-0487

    A use-after-free was discovered in the MOXART SD/MMC Host Controller
    support driver. This flaw does not impact the Debian binary packages
    as CONFIG_MMC_MOXART is not set.

CVE-2022-0492

    Yiqi Sun and Kevin Wang reported that the cgroup-v1 subsystem does
    not properly restrict access to the release-agent feature. A local
    user can take advantage of this flaw for privilege escalation and
    bypass of namespace isolation.

CVE-2022-0617

    butt3rflyh4ck discovered a NULL pointer dereference in the UDF
    filesystem. A local user that can mount a specially crafted UDF
    image can use this flaw to crash the system.

CVE-2022-0644

    Hao Sun reported a missing check for file read permission in the
    finit_module() and kexec_file_load() system calls.  The security
    impact of this is unclear, since these system calls are usually
    only available to the root user.

CVE-2022-22942

    It was discovered that wrong file file descriptor handling in the
    VMware Virtual GPU driver (vmwgfx) could result in information leak
    or privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-24448

    Lyu Tao reported a flaw in the NFS implementation in the Linux
    kernel when handling requests to open a directory on a regular file,
    which could result in a information leak.

CVE-2022-24959

    A memory leak was discovered in the yam_siocdevprivate() function of
    the YAM driver for AX.25, which could result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-25258

    Szymon Heidrich reported the USB Gadget subsystem lacks certain
    validation of interface OS descriptor requests, resulting in memory
    corruption.

CVE-2022-25375

    Szymon Heidrich reported that the RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation
    of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command, resulting in information
    leak from kernel memory.

For the oldstable distribution (buster), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.19.232-1.  This update additionally includes many
more bug fixes from stable updates 4.19.209-4.19.232 inclusive.

Subject: CVE-2021-3640: Linux kernel: UAF in sco_send_frame function

Hello there,

Just like the previous, tedious race condition vulnerability caused by the
unexpected locking behavior (CVE-2021-3573), a similar one is found this
time.

=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=  BUG DETAILS  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

We can find another place that uses bh_lock_sock() in the Linux Bluetooth
stacks.

static void sco_conn_del(struct hci_conn *hcon, int err)
{
    ...
    if (sk) {
        sock_hold(sk);
        bh_lock_sock(sk);   // {1} LOCK
        sco_sock_clear_timer(sk);
        sco_chan_del(sk, err);
        bh_unlock_sock(sk); // {2} UNLOCK
        sco_sock_kill(sk);
        sock_put(sk);
    }
    ...
    hcon->sco_data = NULL;
    kfree(conn);
}

Between these lock pairs, sco_chan_del() is called, which will delete the
channel associated with this sk.
At the end of this function, the conn will be released by kfree().

Similar to the CVE-2021-3573, there is another thread that can be
controlled by the attacker. It will wait for the kfree() and thereafter,
race to cause UAF.

For example, the sco_sock_sendmsg() function.

static int sco_sock_sendmsg(struct socket *sock, struct msghdr *msg,
                size_t len)
{
    ...

    lock_sock(sk);

    if (sk->sk_state == BT_CONNECTED)
        err = sco_send_frame(sk, msg, len);
    else
        err = -ENOTCONN;

    release_sock(sk);
    return err;
}

static int sco_send_frame(struct sock *sk, struct msghdr *msg, int len)
{
    ...

    skb = bt_skb_send_alloc(sk, len, msg->msg_flags & MSG_DONTWAIT, &err);
    if (!skb)
        return err;

    if (memcpy_from_msg(skb_put(skb, len), msg, len)) { // {3}
        kfree_skb(skb);
        return -EFAULT;
    }

    hci_send_sco(conn->hcon, skb);

    ...
}

As you can see, the attacker can adopt userfaultfd technique to stop the
thread at {3} point.

Because the sco_send_frame() is protected by the lock_sock() and
release_sock(), which will not block the sco_conn_del() to release the conn.

One vulnerable race window is shown below:

sco_sock_sendmsg thread        |    sco_conn_del thread
                               |
                               |
lock_sock(sk);                 |
                               |
...                            |    bh_lock_sock(sk);
                               |    ...
                               |    bh_unlock_sock(sk);
                               |    ...

=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=  BUG EFFECTS  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

Similar to CVE-2021-3573, the attacker may stably cause the UAF and do
further exploitation.

As the sco_conn struct is pretty juicy (two previous data pointers inside)

struct sco_conn {
    struct hci_conn    *hcon;

    spinlock_t    lock;
    struct sock    *sk;

    unsigned int    mtu;
};

The attacker can easily spray these kmalloc-32 objects with the malicious
payload, with CAP_NET_ADMIN privilege.

The provided POC code can cause the crash report below:

=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=  BUG REPRODUCE  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

As above introduced, this race condition is highly controllable with
userfaultfd techniques.

The attacker has to fake an SCO connection and then calls
sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting page.
After that, the attacker just needs to detach the controller to call
sco_conn_del().

The calling trace is:

hci_unregister_dev() -> hci_dev_do_close() -> hci_conn_hash_flush() ->
hci_disconn_cfm() ->
sco_disconn_cfm() -> sco_conn_del().

You can refer to the provided POC code for the details.

=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=  Timeline  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

2021-07-08: Bug reported to security@...nel.org and
linux-distros@...openwall.org
2021-07-09: CVE-2021-3640 is assigned
2021-07-22: 14 days of the embargo is over

One sad thing is that the bluez team is currently focused on fixing up the
CVE-2021-3573, which I failed to properly patched, and the patch for this
new is not yet fully discussed.
I hope the patch will be settled down and merged to the mainline in the
near future.

* [Introducing Launchpad Bug Templates](https://blog.launchpad.net/general/introducing-launchpad-bug-templates)
  – 03 Dec 2024

  The new feature bug templates in Launchpad aims to streamline the bug reporting process, making it more efficient for both users and project maintainers. In the past, Launchpad provided only a basic description field for filling bug reports. This often led to incomplete or vague submissions, as users may not include essential details or steps […]
* [Launchpad’s new homepage](https://blog.launchpad.net/general/launchpads-new-homepage)
  – 01 Mar 2024

  Launchpad’s new homepage Launchpad has been around for a while, and its frontpage has remained untouched for a few years now. If you go into launchpad.net, you’ll notice it looks quite different from what it has looked like for the past 10 years – it has been updated! The goal was to modernize it while […]
* [Launchpad-linked federated Matrix accounts](https://blog.launchpad.net/general/launchpad-verified-federated-matrix-accounts)
  – 22 Jan 2024

  Users can now add their Matrix accounts to their profile in Launchpad, as requested by Canonical’s Community team. We also took the chance to slightly rework the frontend and how we display social accounts in the user profiles. Instead of having different sections in the profile for each social account , all social accounts are […]
* [Self-service riscv64 builds](https://blog.launchpad.net/ppa/self-service-riscv64-builds)
  – 22 Nov 2023

  Launchpad has supported building for riscv64 for a while, since it was a requirement to get Ubuntu’s riscv64 port going. We don’t actually have riscv64 hardware in our datacentre, since we’d need server-class hardware with the hypervisor extension and that’s still in its infancy; instead, we do full-system emulation of riscv64 on beefy amd64 hardware […]
* [Introducing Project-Scoped Access Tokens](https://blog.launchpad.net/general/introducing-project-scoped-access-tokens)
  – 20 Nov 2023

  Access tokens can be used to access repositories on behalf of someone. They have scope limitations, optional expiry dates, and can be revoked at any time. They are a stricter and safer alternative to using real user authentication when needing to automate pushing and/or pulling from your git repositories. This is a concept that has […]
* [New domain names for PPAs](https://blog.launchpad.net/ppa/new-domain-names-for-ppas)
  – 16 Feb 2022

  Since they were introduced in 2007, Launchpad’s Personal Package Archives (PPAs) have always been hosted on ppa.launchpad.net. This has generally worked well, but one significant snag became clear later on: it was difficult to add HTTPS support for PPAs due to the way that cookies work on the web. Launchpad uses a cookie for your […]

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Bluetooth: sco: Fix lock\_sock() blockage by memcpy\_from\_msg()

[Browse files](/torvalds/linux/tree/99c23da0eed4fd20cae8243f2b51e10e66aa0951)

```
The sco_send_frame() also takes lock_sock() during memcpy_from_msg()
call that may be endlessly blocked by a task with userfaultd
technique, and this will result in a hung task watchdog trigger.

Just like the similar fix for hci_sock_sendmsg() in commit
[92c685d](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/92c685dc5de02ece9b919f6740fef2c226dbd134) ("Bluetooth: reorganize functions..."), this patch moves
the  memcpy_from_msg() out of lock_sock() for addressing the hang.

This should be the last piece for fixing [CVE-2021-3640](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c8w8-4f3f-5v3j "CVE-2021-3640") after a few
already queued fixes.

Subject: CVE-2021-3640: Linux kernel: UAF in sco_send_frame function

Hello there,

Just like the previous, tedious race condition vulnerability caused by the
unexpected locking behavior (CVE-2021-3573), a similar one is found this
time.

=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=  BUG DETAILS  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

We can find another place that uses bh_lock_sock() in the Linux Bluetooth
stacks.

static void sco_conn_del(struct hci_conn *hcon, int err)
{
    ...
    if (sk) {
        sock_hold(sk);
        bh_lock_sock(sk);   // {1} LOCK
        sco_sock_clear_timer(sk);
        sco_chan_del(sk, err);
        bh_unlock_sock(sk); // {2} UNLOCK
        sco_sock_kill(sk);
        sock_put(sk);
    }
    ...
    hcon->sco_data = NULL;
    kfree(conn);
}

Between these lock pairs, sco_chan_del() is called, which will delete the
channel associated with this sk.
At the end of this function, the conn will be released by kfree().

Similar to the CVE-2021-3573, there is another thread that can be
controlled by the attacker. It will wait for the kfree() and thereafter,
race to cause UAF.

For example, the sco_sock_sendmsg() function.

static int sco_sock_sendmsg(struct socket *sock, struct msghdr *msg,
                size_t len)
{
    ...

    lock_sock(sk);

    if (sk->sk_state == BT_CONNECTED)
        err = sco_send_frame(sk, msg, len);
    else
        err = -ENOTCONN;

    release_sock(sk);
    return err;
}

static int sco_send_frame(struct sock *sk, struct msghdr *msg, int len)
{
    ...

    skb = bt_skb_send_alloc(sk, len, msg->msg_flags & MSG_DONTWAIT, &err);
    if (!skb)
        return err;

    if (memcpy_from_msg(skb_put(skb, len), msg, len)) { // {3}
        kfree_skb(skb);
        return -EFAULT;
    }

    hci_send_sco(conn->hcon, skb);

    ...
}

As you can see, the attacker can adopt userfaultfd technique to stop the
thread at {3} point.

Because the sco_send_frame() is protected by the lock_sock() and
release_sock(), which will not block the sco_conn_del() to release the conn.

One vulnerable race window is shown below:

sco_sock_sendmsg thread        |    sco_conn_del thread
                               |
                               |
lock_sock(sk);                 |
                               |
...                            |    bh_lock_sock(sk);
                               |    ...
                               |    bh_unlock_sock(sk);
                               |    ...
                               |    kfree(conn);
// UAF           |
hci_send_sco(conn->hcon, skb); |
                               |
                               |

=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=  BUG EFFECTS  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

Similar to CVE-2021-3573, the attacker may stably cause the UAF and do
further exploitation.

As the sco_conn struct is pretty juicy (two previous data pointers inside)

struct sco_conn {
    struct hci_conn    *hcon;

    spinlock_t    lock;
    struct sock    *sk;

    unsigned int    mtu;
};

The attacker can easily spray these kmalloc-32 objects with the malicious
payload, with CAP_NET_ADMIN privilege.

The provided POC code can cause the crash report below:

=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=  BUG REPRODUCE  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

As above introduced, this race condition is highly controllable with
userfaultfd techniques.

The attacker has to fake an SCO connection and then calls
sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting page.
After that, the attacker just needs to detach the controller to call
sco_conn_del().

The calling trace is:

hci_unregister_dev() -> hci_dev_do_close() -> hci_conn_hash_flush() ->
hci_disconn_cfm() ->
sco_disconn_cfm() -> sco_conn_del().

You can refer to the provided POC code for the details.

2021-07-08: Bug reported to security@...nel.org and
linux-distros@...openwall.org
2021-07-09: CVE-2021-3640 is assigned
2021-07-22: 14 days of the embargo is over

One sad thing is that the bluez team is currently focused on fixing up the
CVE-2021-3573, which I failed to properly patched, and the patch for this
new is not yet fully discussed.
I hope the patch will be settled down and merged to the mainline in the
near future.

From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

[ Upstream commit 99c23da0eed4fd20cae8243f2b51e10e66aa0951 ]

The sco_send_frame() also takes lock_sock() during memcpy_from_msg()
call that may be endlessly blocked by a task with userfaultd
technique, and this will result in a hung task watchdog trigger.

Just like the similar fix for hci_sock_sendmsg() in commit
92c685dc5de0 ("Bluetooth: reorganize functions..."), this patch moves
the  memcpy_from_msg() out of lock_sock() for addressing the hang.

This should be the last piece for fixing CVE-2021-3640 after a few
already queued fixes.

In our case, there are two Thread A and B:

Context: Thread A:              Context: Thread B:

l2cap_chan_timeout()            __se_sys_shutdown()
  l2cap_chan_close()              l2cap_sock_shutdown()
    l2cap_chan_del()                l2cap_chan_close()
      l2cap_sock_teardown_cb()        l2cap_sock_teardown_cb()

Once l2cap_sock_teardown_cb() excuted, this sock will be marked as SOCK_ZAPPED,
and can be treated as killable in l2cap_sock_kill() if sock_orphan() has
excuted, at this time we close sock through sock_close() which end to call
l2cap_sock_kill() like Thread C:

Context: Thread C:

sock_close()
  l2cap_sock_release()
    sock_orphan()
    l2cap_sock_kill()  #free sock if refcnt is 1

If C completed, Once A or B reaches l2cap_sock_teardown_cb() again,
use-after-free happened.

We should set chan->data to NULL if sock is destructed, for telling teardown
operation is not allowed in l2cap_sock_teardown_cb(), and also we should
avoid killing an already killed socket in l2cap_sock_close_cb().

[ Upstream commit 1975718c488a39128f1f515b23ae61a5a214cc3d ]

Previously, `__query_block()` would fail if the
second WCxx method call failed. However, the
WQxx method might have succeeded, and potentially
allocated memory for the result. Instead of
throwing away the result and potentially
leaking memory, ignore the result of
the second WCxx call.

[ Upstream commit c12aa581f6d5e80c3c3675ab26a52c2b3b62f76e ]

Reading the DMA registers immediately after the reset causes
Data Bus Error. Adding a small delay fixes this issue.

[ Upstream commit 5ca9ce2ba4d5884cd94d1a856c675ab1242cd242 ]

Different SoCs have a different number of channels, e.g .:
* amazon-se has 10 channels,
* danube+ar9 have 20 channels,
* vr9 has 28 channels,
* ar10 has 24 channels.

We can read the ID register and, depending on the reported
number of channels, reset the appropriate number of channels.

[ Upstream commit 0817534ff9ea809fac1322c5c8c574be8483ea57 ]

Syzkaller reported use-after-free bug as described in [1]. The bug is
triggered when smk_set_cipso() tries to free stale category bitmaps
while there are concurrent reader(s) using the same bitmaps.

Wait for RCU grace period to finish before freeing the category bitmaps
in smk_set_cipso(). This makes sure that there are no more readers using
the stale bitmaps and freeing them should be safe.

[ Upstream commit 7fae4c24a2b84a66c7be399727aca11e7a888462 ]

It turns out that a single page of stack is trivial to overflow with
all the tracing gunk enabled. Raise the exception stacks to 2 pages,
which is still half the interrupt stacks, which are at 4 pages.

From: Jonas Dreßler <verdre@v0yd.nl>

[ Upstream commit c2e9666cdffd347460a2b17988db4cfaf2a68fb9 ]

We currently handle changing from the P2P to the STATION virtual
interface type slightly different than changing from P2P to ADHOC: When
changing to STATION, we don't send the SET_BSS_MODE command. We do send
that command on all other type-changes though, and it probably makes
sense to send the command since after all we just changed our BSS_MODE.
Looking at prior changes to this part of the code, it seems that this is
simply a leftover from old refactorings.

Since sending the SET_BSS_MODE command is the only difference between
mwifiex_change_vif_to_sta_adhoc() and the current code, we can now use
mwifiex_change_vif_to_sta_adhoc() for both switching to ADHOC and
STATION interface type.

This does not fix any particular bug and just "looked right", so there's
a small chance it might be a regression.

From: Jonas Dreßler <verdre@v0yd.nl>

[ Upstream commit c606008b70627a2fc485732a53cc22f0f66d0981 ]

When creating a new virtual interface in mwifiex_add_virtual_intf(), we
update our internal driver states like bss_type, bss_priority, bss_role
and bss_mode to reflect the mode the firmware will be set to.

When switching virtual interface mode using
mwifiex_init_new_priv_params() though, we currently only update bss_mode
and bss_role. In order for the interface mode switch to actually work,
we also need to update bss_type to its proper value, so do that.

This fixes a crash of the firmware (because the driver tries to execute
commands that are invalid in AP mode) when switching from station mode
to AP mode.

[ Upstream commit 0961ba6dd211a4a52d1dd4c2d59be60ac2dc08c7 ]

To prevent corrupted frames after starting and stopping the sensor its
datasheet specifies a specific pause sequence to follow:

Stopping:
	Set Pause_Restart Bit -> Set Restart Bit -> Set Chip_Enable Off

Restarting:
	Set Chip_Enable On -> Clear Pause_Restart Bit

The Restart Bit is cleared automatically and must not be cleared
manually as this would cause undefined behavior.

[ Upstream commit dbb4cfea6efe979ed153bd59a6a527a90d3d0ab3 ]

The interrupt handling should be related to the firmware version. If
the driver matches an old firmware, then the driver should not handle
interrupt such as i2c or dma, otherwise it will cause some errors.

This log reveals it:

From: Tuo Li <islituo@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 8515965e5e33f4feb56134348c95953f3eadfb26 ]

The variable pdev is assigned to dev->plat_dev, and dev->plat_dev is
checked in:
  if (!dev->plat_dev)

This indicates both dev->plat_dev and pdev can be NULL. If so, the
function dev_err() is called to print error information.
  dev_err(&pdev->dev, "No platform data specified\n");

However, &pdev->dev is an illegal address, and it is dereferenced in
dev_err().

To fix this possible null-pointer dereference, replace dev_err() with
mfc_err().

If of_device_get_match_data() return NULL,
then null pointer dereference occurs in  s5p_mfc_init_pm().
The patch adds checking if dev->variant is NULL.

[ Upstream commit 476db72e521983ecb847e4013b263072bb1110fc ]

Syzkaller reported a warning called "rcu detected stall in dummy_timer".

The error seems to be an error in mceusb_dev_recv(). In the case of
-EPROTO error, the routine immediately resubmits the URB. Instead it
should return without resubmitting URB.

[ Upstream commit c15b5fc054c3d6c97e953617605235c5cb8ce979 ]

When CONFIG_PRINTK is not set, the CMPXCHG_BUGCHECK() macro calls
_printk(), but _printk() is a static inline function, not available
as an extern.
Since the purpose of the macro is to print the BUGCHECK info,
make this config option depend on PRINTK.

Fixes multiple occurrences of this build error:

../include/linux/printk.h:208:5: error: static declaration of '_printk' follows non-static declaration
  208 | int _printk(const char *s, ...)
      |     ^~~~~~~

[ Upstream commit d3c4b6f64ad356c0d9ddbcf73fa471e6a841cc5c ]

ACPICA commit 0762982923f95eb652cf7ded27356b247c9774de

During wakeup from system-wide sleep states, acpi_get_sleep_type_data()
is called and it tries to get memory from the slab allocator in order
to evaluate a control method, but if KFENCE is enabled in the kernel,
the memory allocation attempt causes an IRQ work to be queued and a
self-IPI to be sent to the CPU running the code which requires the
memory controller to be ready, so if that happens too early in the
wakeup path, it doesn't work.

Prevent that from taking place by calling acpi_get_sleep_type_data()
for S0 upfront, when preparing to enter a given sleep state, and
saving the data obtained by it for later use during system wakeup.

[ Upstream commit 899a61a3305d49e8a712e9ab20d0db94bde5929f ]

In dibusb_read_eeprom_byte(), if dibusb_i2c_msg() fails, val gets
assigned an value that's not properly initialized.
Using kzalloc() in place of kmalloc() for the buffer fixes this issue,
as the val can now be set to 0 in the event dibusb_i2c_msg() fails.

[ Upstream commit 49d67e445742bbcb03106b735b2ab39f6e5c56bc ]

The tracefs file system is by default mounted such that only root user can
access it. But there are legitimate reasons to create a group and allow
those added to the group to have access to tracing. By changing the
permissions of the tracefs mount point to allow access, it will allow
group access to the tracefs directory.

There should not be any real reason to allow all access to the tracefs
directory as it contains sensitive information. Have the default
permission of directories being created not have any OTH (other) bits set,
such that an admin that wants to give permission to a group has to first
disable all OTH bits in the file system.

[ Upstream commit 4b6012a7830b813799a7faf40daa02a837e0fd5b ]

kzalloc() is used to allocate memory for cd->detectors, and if it fails,
channel_detector_exit() behind the label fail will be called:
  channel_detector_exit(dpd, cd);

In channel_detector_exit(), cd->detectors is dereferenced through:
  struct pri_detector *de = cd->detectors[i];

To fix this possible null-pointer dereference, check cd->detectors before
the for loop to dereference cd->detectors.

[ Upstream commit 2835f327bd1240508db2c89fe94a056faa53c49a ]

Some buggy firmware and/or brand new batteries can support a charge that's
slightly over the reported design capacity. In such cases, the kernel will
report to userspace that the charging state of the battery is "Unknown",
when in reality the battery charge is "Full", at least from the design
capacity point of view. Make the fallback condition accepts capacities
over the designed capacity so userspace knows that is full.

For files that lack trailing newlines and match a leaking address (e.g.
wchan[1]), the leaking_addresses.pl report would run together with the
next line, making things look corrupted.

Unconditionally remove the newline on input, and write it back out on
output.

[ Upstream commit 83d3c4f22a36d005b55f44628f46cc0d319a75e8 ]

With valid files, the safety margin described in lib/decompress_unxz.c
ensures that these buffers cannot overlap. But if the uncompressed size
of the input is larger than the caller thought, which is possible when
the input file is invalid/corrupt, the buffers can overlap. Obviously
the result will then be garbage (and usually the decoder will return
an error too) but no other harm will happen when such an over-run occurs.

This change only affects uncompressed LZMA2 chunks and so this
should have no effect on performance.

[ Upstream commit 4f8d7abaa413c34da9d751289849dbfb7c977d05 ]

This might matter, for example, if the underlying type of enum xz_check
was a signed char. In such a case the validation wouldn't have caught an
unsupported header. I don't know if this problem can occur in the kernel
on any arch but it's still good to fix it because some people might copy
the XZ code to their own projects from Linux instead of the upstream
XZ Embedded repository.

This change may increase the code size by a few bytes. An alternative
would have been to use an unsigned int instead of enum xz_check but
using an enumeration looks cleaner.

[ Upstream commit 7ce1bb83a14019f8c396d57ec704d19478747716 ]

If CONFIG_CFI_CLANG=y, attempting to read an event histogram will cause
the kernel to panic due to failed CFI check.

    1. echo 'hist:keys=common_pid' >> events/sched/sched_switch/trigger
    2. cat events/sched/sched_switch/hist
    3. kernel panics on attempting to read hist

This happens because the sort() function expects a generic
int (*)(const void *, const void *) pointer for the compare function.
To prevent this CFI failure, change tracing map cmp_entries_* function
signatures to match this.

Also, fix the build error reported by the kernel test robot [1].

[ Upstream commit 257051a235c17e33782b6e24a4b17f2d7915aaec ]

When the driver fails to request the firmware, it calls its error
handler. In the error handler, the driver detaches device from driver
first before releasing the firmware, which can cause a use-after-free bug.

Fix this by releasing firmware first.

The following log reveals it:

That happens because swsusp_check() calls set_blocksize() on the

To address this issue, modify swsusp_check() to open the target block

[ Upstream commit e5322b9ab5f63536c41301150b7ce64605ce52cc ]

Just like we have default SMPS mode as dynamic in powersave,
we should not enable RX-diversity in powersave, to reduce
power consumption when connected to a non-MIMO AP.

[ Upstream commit f91488ee15bd3cac467e2d6a361fc2d34d1052ae ]

syzbot is reporting kernel panic at smk_cipso_doi() due to memory
allocation fault injection [1]. The reason for need to use panic() was
not explained. But since no fix was proposed for 18 months, for now
let's use __GFP_NOFAIL for utilizing syzbot resource on other bugs.

From: Masami Hiramatsu <mhiramat@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit b3ea5d56f212ad81328c82454829a736197ebccc ]

Currently the stacktrace on clang compiled arm kernel uses the 'lr'
register to find the first frame address from pt_regs. However, that
is wrong after calling another function, because the 'lr' register
is used by 'bl' instruction and never be recovered.

As same as gcc arm kernel, directly use the frame pointer (r11) of
the pt_regs to find the first frame address.

Note that this fixes kretprobe stacktrace issue only with
CONFIG_UNWINDER_FRAME_POINTER=y. For the CONFIG_UNWINDER_ARM,
we need another fix.

When addr_gen_mode is set to IN6_ADDR_GEN_MODE_NONE, the link-local addr
should not be generated. But it isn't the case for GRE (as well as GRE6)
and SIT tunnels. Make it so that tunnels consider the addr_gen_mode,
especially for IN6_ADDR_GEN_MODE_NONE.

Do this in add_v4_addrs() to cover both GRE and SIT only if the addr
scope is link.

[ Upstream commit 345dac33f58894a56d17b92a41be10e16585ceff ]

When configuring the kernel for big-endian, we set either BE-8 or BE-32
based on the CPU architecture level. Until linux-4.4, we did not have
any ARMv7-M platform allowing big-endian builds, but now i.MX/Vybrid
is in that category, adn we get a build error because of this:

arch/arm/kernel/module-plts.c: In function 'get_module_plt':
arch/arm/kernel/module-plts.c:60:46: error: implicit declaration of function '__opcode_to_mem_thumb32' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]

This comes down to picking the wrong default, ARMv7-M uses BE8
like ARMv7-A does. Changing the default gets the kernel to compile
and presumably works.

[ Upstream commit 9cc2fa4f4a92ccc6760d764e7341be46ee8aaaa1 ]

The function end_of_stack() returns a pointer to the last entry of a
stack. For architectures like parisc where the stack grows upwards
return the pointer to the highest address in the stack.

Without this change I faced a crash on parisc, because the stackleak
functionality wrote STACKLEAK_POISON to the lowest address and thus
overwrote the first 4 bytes of the task_struct which included the
TIF_FLAGS.

[ Upstream commit 66e29fcda1824f0427966fbee2bd2c85bf362c82 ]

With idle polling, IPIs are not sent when a CPU idle, but queued
and run later from do_idle(). The default kgdb_call_nmi_hook()
implementation gets the pointer to struct pt_regs from get_irq_reqs(),
which doesn't work in that case because it was not called from the
IPI interrupt handler. Fix it by defining our own kgdb_roundup()
function which sents an IPI_ENTER_KGDB. When that IPI is received
on the target CPU kgdb_nmicallback() is called.

I won't insist on rejecting this one, but especially given this

it occasionally (or even often) may produce some good.

I have hundreds of examples of patches that claim they are just an
improvement but fix a serious bug :)

Subject: CVE-2021-3640: Linux kernel: UAF in sco_send_frame function

Hello there,

Just like the previous, tedious race condition vulnerability caused by the
unexpected locking behavior (CVE-2021-3573), a similar one is found this
time.

=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=  BUG DETAILS  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

We can find another place that uses bh_lock_sock() in the Linux Bluetooth
stacks.

static void sco_conn_del(struct hci_conn *hcon, int err)
{
    ...
    if (sk) {
        sock_hold(sk);
        bh_lock_sock(sk);   // {1} LOCK
        sco_sock_clear_timer(sk);
        sco_chan_del(sk, err);
        bh_unlock_sock(sk); // {2} UNLOCK
        sco_sock_kill(sk);
        sock_put(sk);
    }
    ...
    hcon->sco_data = NULL;
    kfree(conn);
}

Between these lock pairs, sco_chan_del() is called, which will delete the
channel associated with this sk.
At the end of this function, the conn will be released by kfree().

Similar to the CVE-2021-3573, there is another thread that can be
controlled by the attacker. It will wait for the kfree() and thereafter,
race to cause UAF.

For example, the sco_sock_sendmsg() function.

static int sco_sock_sendmsg(struct socket *sock, struct msghdr *msg,
                size_t len)
{
    ...

    lock_sock(sk);

    if (sk->sk_state == BT_CONNECTED)
        err = sco_send_frame(sk, msg, len);
    else
        err = -ENOTCONN;

    release_sock(sk);
    return err;
}

static int sco_send_frame(struct sock *sk, struct msghdr *msg, int len)
{
    ...

    skb = bt_skb_send_alloc(sk, len, msg->msg_flags & MSG_DONTWAIT, &err);
    if (!skb)
        return err;

    if (memcpy_from_msg(skb_put(skb, len), msg, len)) { // {3}
        kfree_skb(skb);
        return -EFAULT;
    }

    hci_send_sco(conn->hcon, skb);

    ...
}

As you can see, the attacker can adopt userfaultfd technique to stop the
thread at {3} point.

Because the sco_send_frame() is protected by the lock_sock() and
release_sock(), which will not block the sco_conn_del() to release the conn.

One vulnerable race window is shown below:

sco_sock_sendmsg thread        |    sco_conn_del thread
                               |
                               |
lock_sock(sk);                 |
                               |
...                            |    bh_lock_sock(sk);
                               |    ...
                               |    bh_unlock_sock(sk);
                               |    ...
                               |    kfree(conn);
// UAF           |
hci_send_sco(conn->hcon, skb); |
                               |
                               |

=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=  BUG EFFECTS  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

Similar to CVE-2021-3573, the attacker may stably cause the UAF and do
further exploitation.

As the sco_conn struct is pretty juicy (two previous data pointers inside)

struct sco_conn {
    struct hci_conn    *hcon;

    spinlock_t    lock;
    struct sock    *sk;

    unsigned int    mtu;
};

The attacker can easily spray these kmalloc-32 objects with the malicious
payload, with CAP_NET_ADMIN privilege.

The provided POC code can cause the crash report below:

As above introduced, this race condition is highly controllable with
userfaultfd techniques.

The attacker has to fake an SCO connection and then calls
sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting page.
After that, the attacker just needs to detach the controller to call
sco_conn_del().

The calling trace is:

hci_unregister_dev() -> hci_dev_do_close() -> hci_conn_hash_flush() ->
hci_disconn_cfm() ->
sco_disconn_cfm() -> sco_conn_del().

You can refer to the provided POC code for the details.

2021-07-08: Bug reported to security@...nel.org and
linux-distros@...openwall.org
2021-07-09: CVE-2021-3640 is assigned
2021-07-22: 14 days of the embargo is over

One sad thing is that the bluez team is currently focused on fixing up the
CVE-2021-3573, which I failed to properly patched, and the patch for this
new is not yet fully discussed.
I hope the patch will be settled down and merged to the mainline in the
near future.

| [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1188172#c5)  Marcus Meissner   2021-07-22 09:57:59 UTC  ``` do we have affected list of kernels? ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1188172#c6)  Marcus Meissner   2021-07-22 11:48:07 UTC  ``` public via oss-sec  From: Lin Horse <kylin.formalin@gmail.com> Subject: [oss-security] CVE-2021-3640: Linux kernel: UAF in sco_send_frame function  Hello there,  Just like the previous, tedious race condition vulnerability caused by the unexpected locking behavior (CVE-2021-3573), a similar one is found this time.  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=  BUG DETAILS  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=  We can find another place that uses bh_lock_sock() in the Linux Bluetooth stacks.  static void sco_conn_del(struct hci_conn *hcon, int err) {     ...     if (sk) {         sock_hold(sk);         bh_lock_sock(sk);   // {1} LOCK         sco_sock_clear_timer(sk);         sco_chan_del(sk, err);         bh_unlock_sock(sk); // {2} UNLOCK         sco_sock_kill(sk);         sock_put(sk);     }     ...     hcon->sco_data = NULL;     kfree(conn); }  Between these lock pairs, sco_chan_del() is called, which will delete the channel associated with this sk. At the end of this function, the conn will be released by kfree().  Similar to the CVE-2021-3573, there is another thread that can be controlled by the attacker. It will wait for the kfree() and thereafter, race to cause UAF.  For example, the sco_sock_sendmsg() function.  static int sco_sock_sendmsg(struct socket *sock, struct msghdr *msg,                 size_t len) {     ...      lock_sock(sk);      if (sk->sk_state == BT_CONNECTED)         err = sco_send_frame(sk, msg, len);     else         err = -ENOTCONN;      release_sock(sk);     return err; }  static int sco_send_frame(struct sock *sk, struct msghdr *msg, int len) {     ...      skb = bt_skb_send_alloc(sk, len, msg->msg_flags & MSG_DONTWAIT, &err);     if (!skb)         return err;      if (memcpy_from_msg(skb_put(skb, len), msg, len)) { // {3}         kfree_skb(skb);         return -EFAULT;     }      hci_send_sco(conn->hcon, skb);      ... }  As you can see, the attacker can adopt userfaultfd technique to stop the thread at {3} point.  Because the sco_send_frame() is protected by the lock_sock() and release_sock(), which will not block the sco_conn_del() to release the conn.

As the sco_conn struct is pretty juicy (two previous data pointers inside)  struct sco_conn {     struct hci_conn    *hcon;      spinlock_t    lock;     struct sock    *sk;      unsigned int    mtu; };  The attacker can easily spray these kmalloc-32 objects with the malicious payload, with CAP_NET_ADMIN privilege.

The attacker has to fake an SCO connection and then calls sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting page. After that, the attacker just needs to detach the controller to call sco_conn_del().  The calling trace is:  hci_unregister_dev() -> hci_dev_do_close() -> hci_conn_hash_flush() -> hci_disconn_cfm() -> sco_disconn_cfm() -> sco_conn_del().

For addressing this, we might need to go out of schedule() with a timeout, e.g. the below one-liner already fixes it:  --- a/net/core/sock.c +++ b/net/core/sock.c @@ -2531,7 +2531,7 @@ void __lock_sock(struct sock *sk)                 prepare_to_wait_exclusive(&sk->sk_lock.wq, &wait,                                         TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);                 spin_unlock_bh(&sk->sk_lock.slock); -               schedule(); +               schedule_timeout(msecs_to_jiffies(10 * 1000));                 spin_lock_bh(&sk->sk_lock.slock);                 if (!sock_owned_by_user(sk))                         break;  In anyway, now I backported the three patches above to SLE15-SP2, cve/linux-4.12 and cve/linux-4.4 branches.  I believe we can leave the rest older branches: the userfaultd technique isn't available on those old kernels, and the BT must be very rarely used (if any), while the patch adaption would need quite many intrusive changes.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2004037#c0)  rcheerla    2021-09-14 12:02:02 UTC  ``` Description of problem: pcpu_get_vm_areas using most of the memory during container recreation using podman.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): RHEL 8.4 4.18.0-305.17.1.el8_4.x86_64  podman-3.2.3-0.10.module+el8.4.0+11989+6676f7ad.x86_64 podman-catatonit-3.2.3-0.10.module+el8.4.0+11989+6676f7ad.x86_64   How reproducible: 100%   Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install RHEL 8.4   2. Install container tools.  $ dnf install -y @container-tools    3. Run below podman command in a loop, you may run multiple loops with different name to get quick spike in Percpu counter value in /proc/meminfo output.  $ while :; do podman run --name=test --replace centos /bin/echo 'running'; done  Actual results:  Percpu usage is getting increasing gradually.  Expected results: Memory should get released in Percpu usage.   Additional info: Similar kind of issue has been discussed in the following LWN link.  <https://lwn.net/Articles/851475/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2004037#c1)  rcheerla    2021-09-14 12:48:37 UTC  ``` Hello Team,  1] Executed below command multiple times like below on RHEL 8.4 latest kernel.  while :;

Increase in percpu memory consumption over time is inevitable due to memory fragmentation. However, we will backport some of the upstream percpu related commits to reduce the rate of increase.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2004037#c4)  Waiman Long    2021-09-16 13:33:46 UTC  ``` What I have found out is that the increase in percpu memory consumption is likely due to the percpu vmstat data in dying mem_cgroup structures being held in place by references stored in page cache. By "echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches", this will allow those dying mem_cgroup structures to finally get freed. Could you try that to see if that helps to reduce the percpu memory consumption back to a more normal level?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2004037#c5)  rcheerla    2021-09-16 14:48:25 UTC  ``` Hi Waiman,  I have tried "echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches" but did not help.  o Before initiating "podman run" command.   $ grep Per /proc/meminfo  Percpu:            20160 kB  $ cat /proc/cgroups | column -t #subsys_name  hierarchy  num_cgroups  enabled memory        3          163          1  $ date  Thu Sep 16 08:56:05 CDT 2021  $ grep Per /proc/meminfo  Percpu:            31872 kB   o After the loop has been completed.   $ ps aux | grep -i "podman run" root     3968422  0.0  0.0  12136  1196 pts/0    S+   09:32   0:00 grep --color=auto -i podman run  $ date  Thu Sep 16 09:36:26 CDT 2021  $ grep Per /proc/meminfo  Percpu:           111456 kB  <<---  $ cat /proc/cgroups | column -t #subsys_name  hierarchy  num_cgroups  enabled memory        3          1327         1   $ echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches  $ echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches  $ echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches  $ sync  o Still it did not reduce.   $ grep Per /proc/meminfo  Percpu:           111456 kB    <<<---   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2004037#c9)  rcheerla    2021-09-20 17:50:22 UTC  ``` (In reply to Waiman Long from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=2004037#c8))  > Well, it is what I have expected.

Bluetooth: sco: Fix lock\_sock() blockage by memcpy\_from\_msg()The sco\_send\_frame() also takes lock\_sock() during memcpy\_from\_msg()
call that may be endlessly blocked by a task with userfaultd
technique, and this will result in a hung task watchdog trigger.
Just like the similar fix for hci\_sock\_sendmsg() in commit
92c685dc5de0 ("Bluetooth: reorganize functions..."), this patch moves
the memcpy\_from\_msg() out of lock\_sock() for addressing the hang.
This should be the last piece for fixing CVE-2021-3640 after a few
already queued fixes.

## Details

Jeremy Cline discovered a use-after-free in the nouveau graphics driver of

the Linux kernel during device removal. A privileged or physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2020-27820](/security/CVE-2020-27820))

It was discovered that the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel

contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2021-3640](/security/CVE-2021-3640))

Likang Luo discovered that a race condition existed in the Bluetooth

subsystem of the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2021-3752](/security/CVE-2021-3752))

It was discovered that the SCTP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly verify VTAGs in some situations. A remote attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service (connection disassociation).

([CVE-2021-3772](/security/CVE-2021-3772))

It was discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel

contained a race condition around read-only maps. A privileged attacker

could use this to modify read-only maps. ([CVE-2021-4001](/security/CVE-2021-4001))

It was discovered that the NFS server implementation in the Linux kernel

contained an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2021-4090](/security/CVE-2021-4090))

Felix Wilhelm discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly handle exit events from AMD Secure Encrypted

Virtualization-Encrypted State (SEV-ES) guest VMs. An attacker in a guest

VM could use this to cause a denial of service (host kernel crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code in the host kernel. ([CVE-2021-4093](/security/CVE-2021-4093))

Lin Ma discovered that the NFC Controller Interface (NCI) implementation in

the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free

vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2021-4202](/security/CVE-2021-4202))

It was discovered that the AMD Radeon GPU driver in the Linux kernel did

not properly validate writes in the debugfs file system. A privileged

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2021-42327](/security/CVE-2021-42327))

Luo Likang discovered that the FireDTV Firewire driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2021-42739](/security/CVE-2021-42739))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

A flaw use-after-free in function sco\_sock\_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel
HCI subsystem was found in the way user calls ioct UFFDIO\_REGISTER or other
way triggers race condition of the call sco\_conn\_del() together with the
call sco\_sock\_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory
page. A privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or
escalate their privileges on the system.

## From the Ubuntu Security Team

It was discovered that the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel
contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this
to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1978539#c0)  Carlos Soriano    2021-07-02 06:16:19 UTC  ``` I briefly talked with Jemore about hmm tests, and he said that there are some tests that try to exercise hmm like a driver would, but in software. They also test memory migration. It is better than nothing and it is something we can grow. They are part of tools/testing/selftests/vm/ in kernel tree and lib/test_hmm.c.  Discussed this with ddutile over email and he asked to file this BZ to add those to the mm CI.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1978539#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-11-08 10:14:11 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory (Moderate: kernel security, bug fix, and enhancement update), and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.  [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:7683](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A7683)   ``` |  |

Launchpad can host your project’s source code
using the [Bazaar](http://bazaar.canonical.com/)
or the [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
version control system.
We also import
[thousands of
CVS, SVN and Git projects](/%2Brecently-imported-branches).
([Read our guide](https://help.launchpad.net/Code))

Launchpad can build Ubuntu packages directly from branches using recipes.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

Debian Bug     : 988044 989285 990411 994050

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2020-29374

    Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
    management.  A parent and child process initially share all their
    memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
    duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write).  However, in case an
    operation such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an
    additional reference to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs
    during this operation, the kernel might have accessed the wrong
    process's memory.  For some programs, this could lead to an
    information leak or data corruption.

    This issue was already fixed for most architectures, but not on
    MIPS and System z.  This update corrects that.

CVE-2020-36322, CVE-2021-28950

    The syzbot tool found that the FUSE (filesystem-in-user-space)
    implementation did not correctly handle a FUSE server returning
    invalid attributes for a file.  A local user permitted to run a
    FUSE server could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    The original fix for this introduced a different potential denial
    of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has also been
    fixed.

CVE-2021-3640

    Lin Ma discovered a race condiiton in the Bluetooth protocol
    implementation that can lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3744, CVE-2021-3764

    minihanshen reported bugs in the ccp driver for AMD
    Cryptographic Coprocessors that could lead to a resource leak.
    On systems using this driver, a local user could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service.

CVE-2021-3752

    Likang Luo of NSFOCUS Security Team discovered a flaw in the
    Bluetooth L2CAP implementation that can lead to a user-after-free.
    A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3760, CVE-2021-4202

    Lin Ma discovered race conditions in the NCI (NFC Controller
    Interface) driver, which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-3772

    A flaw was found in the SCTP protocol implementation, which would
    allow a networked attacker to break an SCTP association.  The
    attacker would only need to know or guess the IP addresses and
    ports for the association.

CVE-2021-4002

    It was discovered that hugetlbfs, the virtual filesystem used by
    applications to allocate huge pages in RAM, did not flush the
    CPU's TLB in one case where it was necessary.  In some
    circumstances a local user would be able to read and write huge
    pages after they are freed and reallocated to a different process.
    This could lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or
    information leaks.

CVE-2021-4083

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the local (Unix) sockets
    garbage collector, that can lead to use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-4135

    A flaw was found in the netdevsim driver which would lead to an
    information leak.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-4155

    Kirill Tkhai discovered a data leak in the way the XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP
    IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for a size increase of files
    with unaligned size. A local attacker can take advantage of this
    flaw to leak data on the XFS filesystem.

CVE-2021-4203

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the local (Unix) sockets
    implementation that can lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this to leak sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2021-20317

    It was discovered that the timer queue structure could become
    corrupt, leading to waiting tasks never being woken up.  A local
    user with certain privileges could exploit this to cause a denial
    of service (system hang).

CVE-2021-20321

    A race condition was discovered in the overlayfs filesystem
    driver.  A local user with access to an overlayfs mount and to its
    underlying upper directory could exploit this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-20322

    An information leak was discovered in the IPv4 implementation.  A
    remote attacker could exploit this to quickly discover which UDP
    ports a system is using, making it easier for them to carry out a
    DNS poisoning attack against that system.

CVE-2021-22600

    The syzbot tool found a flaw in the packet socket (AF_PACKET)
    implementation which could lead to incorrectly freeing memory.  A
    local user with CAP_NET_RAW capability (in any user namespace)
    could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713 (XSA-391)

    Juergen Gross reported that malicious PV backends can cause a denial
    of service to guests being serviced by those backends via high
    frequency events, even if those backends are running in a less
    privileged environment.

CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715 (XSA-392)

    Juergen Gross discovered that Xen guests can force the Linux
    netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory, resulting in
    denial of service.

CVE-2021-38300

    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a flaw in the classic BPF (cBPF) JIT
    compiler for MIPS architectures.  A local user could exploit
    this to excute arbitrary code in the kernel.

    This issue is mitigated by setting sysctl
    net.core.bpf_jit_enable=0, which is the default.  It is *not*
    mitigated by disabling unprivileged use of eBPF.

CVE-2021-39685

    Szymon Heidrich discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the
    USB gadget subsystem, resulting in information disclosure, denial of
    service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-39686

    A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, that
    could lead to incorrect security checks.  On systems where the
    binder driver is loaded, a local user could exploit this for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-39698

    Linus Torvalds reported a flaw in the file polling implementation,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user could exploit
    this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-39713

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling
    subsystem which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-41864

    An integer overflow was discovered in the Extended BPF (eBPF)
    subsystem.  A local user could exploit this for denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

    This can be mitigated by setting sysctl
    kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1, which disables eBPF use by
    unprivileged users.

CVE-2021-42739

    A heap buffer overflow was discovered in the firedtv driver for
    FireWire-connected DVB receivers.  A local user with access to a
    firedtv device could exploit this for denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-43389

    The Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a flaw in the CMTP
    subsystem as used by Bluetooth, which could lead to an
    out-of-bounds read and object type confusion.  A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in the initial user namespace could
    exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash),
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-43975

    Brendan Dolan-Gavitt reported a flaw in the
    hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait() function in the aQuantia AQtion ethernet
    device driver which can result in denial of service or the execution
    of arbitrary code.

CVE-2021-43976

    Zekun Shen and Brendan Dolan-Gavitt discovered a flaw in the
    mwifiex_usb_recv() function of the Marvell WiFi-Ex USB Driver. An
    attacker able to connect a crafted USB device can take advantage of
    this flaw to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2021-44733

    A race condition was discovered in the Trusted Execution
    Environment (TEE) subsystem for Arm processors, which could lead
    to a use-after-free.  A local user permitted to access a TEE
    device could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-45095

    It was discovered that the Phone Network protocol (PhoNet) driver
    has a reference count leak in the pep_sock_accept() function.

CVE-2021-45469

    Wenqing Liu reported an out-of-bounds memory access in the f2fs
    implementation if an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. An
    attacker able to mount a specially crafted image can take advantage
    of this flaw for denial of service.

CVE-2021-45480

    A memory leak flaw was discovered in the __rds_conn_create()
    function in the RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) protocol subsystem.

CVE-2022-0001 (INTEL-SA-00598)

    Researchers at VUSec discovered that the Branch History Buffer in
    Intel processors can be exploited to create information side-
    channels with speculative execution.  This issue is similar to
    Spectre variant 2, but requires additional mitigations on some
    processors.

    This can be exploited to obtain sensitive information from a
    different security context, such as from user-space to the kernel,
    or from a KVM guest to the kernel.

CVE-2022-0002 (INTEL-SA-00598)

    This is a similar issue to CVE-2022-0001, but covers exploitation
    within a security context, such as from JIT-compiled code in a
    sandbox to hosting code in the same process.

    This can be partly mitigated by disabling eBPF for unprivileged
    users with the sysctl: kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=2.  This
    update does that by default.

CVE-2022-0322

    Eiichi Tsukata discovered a flaw in the sctp_make_strreset_req()
    function in the SCTP network protocol implementation which can
    result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-0330

    Sushma Venkatesh Reddy discovered a missing GPU TLB flush in the
    i915 driver, resulting in denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-0435

    Samuel Page and Eric Dumazet reported a stack overflow in the
    networking module for the Transparent Inter-Process Communication
    (TIPC) protocol, resulting in denial of service or potentially the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2022-0487

    A use-after-free was discovered in the MOXART SD/MMC Host Controller
    support driver. This flaw does not impact the Debian binary packages
    as CONFIG_MMC_MOXART is not set.

CVE-2022-0492

    Yiqi Sun and Kevin Wang reported that the cgroup-v1 subsystem does
    not properly restrict access to the release-agent feature. A local
    user can take advantage of this flaw for privilege escalation and
    bypass of namespace isolation.

CVE-2022-0617

    butt3rflyh4ck discovered a NULL pointer dereference in the UDF
    filesystem. A local user that can mount a specially crafted UDF
    image can use this flaw to crash the system.

CVE-2022-0644

    Hao Sun reported a missing check for file read permission in the
    finit_module() and kexec_file_load() system calls.  The security
    impact of this is unclear, since these system calls are usually
    only available to the root user.

CVE-2022-22942

    It was discovered that wrong file file descriptor handling in the
    VMware Virtual GPU driver (vmwgfx) could result in information leak
    or privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-24448

    Lyu Tao reported a flaw in the NFS implementation in the Linux
    kernel when handling requests to open a directory on a regular file,
    which could result in a information leak.

CVE-2022-24959

    A memory leak was discovered in the yam_siocdevprivate() function of
    the YAM driver for AX.25, which could result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-25258

    Szymon Heidrich reported the USB Gadget subsystem lacks certain
    validation of interface OS descriptor requests, resulting in memory
    corruption.

CVE-2022-25375

    Szymon Heidrich reported that the RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation
    of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command, resulting in information
    leak from kernel memory.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.232-1~deb9u1.  This update additionally includes many more bug
fixes from stable updates 4.19.209-4.19.232 inclusive.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2255283#c0)  Robb Gatica    2023-12-19 21:02:48 UTC  ``` A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's ipv4: igmp component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

A flaw use-after-free in function sco\_sock\_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel
HCI subsystem was found in the way user calls ioct UFFDIO\_REGISTER or other
way triggers race condition of the call sco\_conn\_del() together with the
call sco\_sock\_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory
page. A privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or
escalate their privileges on the system.

## From the Ubuntu Security Team

It was discovered that the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel
contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this
to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code.

Debian Bug     : 990411

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2021-3640

    LinMa of BlockSec Team discovered a race condition in the
    Bluetooth SCO implementation that can lead to a use-after-free.  A
    local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3752

    Likang Luo of NSFOCUS Security Team discovered a flaw in the
    Bluetooth L2CAP implementation that can lead to a user-after-free.
    A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-4002

    It was discovered that hugetlbfs, the virtual filesystem used by
    applications to allocate huge pages in RAM, did not flush the
    CPU's TLB in one case where it was necessary.  In some
    circumstances a local user would be able to read and write huge
    pages after they are freed and reallocated to a different process.
    This could lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or
    information leaks.

CVE-2021-4083

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the local (Unix) sockets
    garbage collector, that can lead to use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-4155

    Kirill Tkhai discovered a data leak in the way the XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP
    IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for a size increase of files
    with unaligned size. A local attacker can take advantage of this
    flaw to leak data on the XFS filesystem.

CVE-2021-4202

    Lin Ma discovered a race condition in the NCI (NFC Controller
    Interface) driver, which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713 (XSA-391)

    Juergen Gross reported that malicious PV backends can cause a denial
    of service to guests being serviced by those backends via high
    frequency events, even if those backends are running in a less
    privileged environment.

CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715 (XSA-392)

    Juergen Gross discovered that Xen guests can force the Linux
    netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory, resulting in
    denial of service.

CVE-2021-29264

    It was discovered that the "gianfar" Ethernet driver used with
    some Freescale SoCs did not correctly handle a Rx queue overrun
    when jumbo packets were enabled.  On systems using this driver and
    jumbo packets, an attacker on the network could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (crash).

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-33033

    The syzbot tool found a reference counting bug in the CIPSO
    implementation that can lead to a use-after-free.

    This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-39685

    Szymon Heidrich discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the
    USB gadget subsystem, resulting in information disclosure, denial of
    service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-39686

    A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, that
    could lead to incorrect security checks.  On systems where the
    binder driver is loaded, a local user could exploit this for
    privilege escalation.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-39698

    Linus Torvalds reported a flaw in the file polling implementation,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user could exploit
    this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-39714

    A potential reference count overflow was found in the Android Ion
    driver.  On systems where the Ion driver is loaded, a local user
    could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-43976

    Zekun Shen and Brendan Dolan-Gavitt discovered a flaw in the
    mwifiex_usb_recv() function of the Marvell WiFi-Ex USB Driver. An
    attacker able to connect a crafted USB device can take advantage of
    this flaw to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2021-45095

    It was discovered that the Phone Network protocol (PhoNet) driver
    has a reference count leak in the pep_sock_accept() function.

CVE-2022-0001 (INTEL-SA-00598)

    Researchers at VUSec discovered that the Branch History Buffer in
    Intel processors can be exploited to create information side-
    channels with speculative execution.  This issue is similar to
    Spectre variant 2, but requires additional mitigations on some
    processors.

    This can be exploited to obtain sensitive information from a
    different security context, such as from user-space to the kernel,
    or from a KVM guest to the kernel.

CVE-2022-0002 (INTEL-SA-00598)

    This is a similar issue to CVE-2022-0001, but covers exploitation
    within a security context, such as from JIT-compiled code in a
    sandbox to hosting code in the same process.

    This can be partly mitigated by disabling eBPF for unprivileged
    users with the sysctl: kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=2.  This
    update does that by default.

CVE-2022-0330

    Sushma Venkatesh Reddy discovered a missing GPU TLB flush in the
    i915 driver, resulting in denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-0435

    Samuel Page and Eric Dumazet reported a stack overflow in the
    networking module for the Transparent Inter-Process Communication
    (TIPC) protocol, resulting in denial of service or potentially the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2022-0487

    A use-after-free was discovered in the MOXART SD/MMC Host Controller
    support driver. This flaw does not impact the Debian binary packages
    as CONFIG_MMC_MOXART is not set.

CVE-2022-0492

    Yiqi Sun and Kevin Wang reported that the cgroup-v1 subsystem does
    not properly restrict access to the release-agent feature. A local
    user can take advantage of this flaw for privilege escalation and
    bypass of namespace isolation.

CVE-2022-0617

    butt3rflyh4ck discovered a NULL pointer dereference in the UDF
    filesystem. A local user that can mount a specially crafted UDF
    image can use this flaw to crash the system.

CVE-2022-24448

    Description

CVE-2022-25258

    Szymon Heidrich reported the USB Gadget subsystem lacks certain
    validation of interface OS descriptor requests, resulting in memory
    corruption.

CVE-2022-25375

    Szymon Heidrich reported that the RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation
    of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command, resulting in information
    leak from kernel memory.

If qi.output_buffer_length is equal to zero, the `memdup_user` function returns `0x10` which is not a valid ptr but can pass the check. Later this evil `buffer` is pass to function `SMB2_set_info_init` if qi.flags is equal to `PASSTHRU_SET_INFO`. In function `SMB2_set_info_init`, there is a straight memcpy which `*data` is previous evil buffer and `*size` is 8.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2037386#c6)  Alex    2022-01-16 15:58:39 UTC  ``` The candidate patch is:  /* There is a patch also suggested by the researcher  (Billy Jheng Bing Jhong of STAR Labs)  */  diff --git a/fs/cifs/smb2ops.c b/fs/cifs/smb2ops.c index c5b1dea54ebc..3d656f7c907f 100644 --- a/fs/cifs/smb2ops.c +++ b/fs/cifs/smb2ops.c @@ -1643,7 +1643,7 @@ smb2_ioctl_query_info(const unsigned int xid,         if (copy_from_user(&qi, arg, sizeof(struct smb_query_info)))                 goto e_fault;  -       if (qi.output_buffer_length > 1024) { +       if (qi.output_buffer_length > 1024 || qi.output_buffer_length == 0) {                 kfree(vars);                 return -EINVAL;         }   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2037386#c7)  Rohit Keshri    2022-03-23 09:08:09 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2067080](show_bug.cgi?id=2067080 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2022-0168 kernel: smb2_ioctl_query_info NULL Pointer Dereference [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2037386#c8)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2022-04-11 07:26:45 UTC  ``` <https://git.kernel.org/linus/d6f5e358452479fa8a773b5c6ccc9e4ec5a20880> seem the related fix for this issue?   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2037386#c12)  Justin M.

## Description

A flaw use-after-free in function sco\_sock\_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the way user calls ioct UFFDIO\_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco\_conn\_del() together with the call sco\_sock\_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

[ Upstream commit 99c23da0eed4fd20cae8243f2b51e10e66aa0951 ]

The sco_send_frame() also takes lock_sock() during memcpy_from_msg()
call that may be endlessly blocked by a task with userfaultd
technique, and this will result in a hung task watchdog trigger.

Just like the similar fix for hci_sock_sendmsg() in commit
92c685dc5de0 ("Bluetooth: reorganize functions..."), this patch moves
the  memcpy_from_msg() out of lock_sock() for addressing the hang.

This should be the last piece for fixing CVE-2021-3640 after a few
already queued fixes.

In our case, there are two Thread A and B:

Context: Thread A:              Context: Thread B:

l2cap_chan_timeout()            __se_sys_shutdown()
  l2cap_chan_close()              l2cap_sock_shutdown()
    l2cap_chan_del()                l2cap_chan_close()
      l2cap_sock_teardown_cb()        l2cap_sock_teardown_cb()

Once l2cap_sock_teardown_cb() excuted, this sock will be marked as SOCK_ZAPPED,
and can be treated as killable in l2cap_sock_kill() if sock_orphan() has
excuted, at this time we close sock through sock_close() which end to call
l2cap_sock_kill() like Thread C:

Context: Thread C:

sock_close()
  l2cap_sock_release()
    sock_orphan()
    l2cap_sock_kill()  #free sock if refcnt is 1

If C completed, Once A or B reaches l2cap_sock_teardown_cb() again,
use-after-free happened.

We should set chan->data to NULL if sock is destructed, for telling teardown
operation is not allowed in l2cap_sock_teardown_cb(), and also we should
avoid killing an already killed socket in l2cap_sock_close_cb().

[ Upstream commit 1975718c488a39128f1f515b23ae61a5a214cc3d ]

Previously, `__query_block()` would fail if the
second WCxx method call failed. However, the
WQxx method might have succeeded, and potentially
allocated memory for the result. Instead of
throwing away the result and potentially
leaking memory, ignore the result of
the second WCxx call.

[ Upstream commit c12aa581f6d5e80c3c3675ab26a52c2b3b62f76e ]

Reading the DMA registers immediately after the reset causes
Data Bus Error. Adding a small delay fixes this issue.

[ Upstream commit 5ca9ce2ba4d5884cd94d1a856c675ab1242cd242 ]

Different SoCs have a different number of channels, e.g .:
* amazon-se has 10 channels,
* danube+ar9 have 20 channels,
* vr9 has 28 channels,
* ar10 has 24 channels.

We can read the ID register and, depending on the reported
number of channels, reset the appropriate number of channels.

[ Upstream commit 0817534ff9ea809fac1322c5c8c574be8483ea57 ]

Syzkaller reported use-after-free bug as described in [1]. The bug is
triggered when smk_set_cipso() tries to free stale category bitmaps
while there are concurrent reader(s) using the same bitmaps.

Wait for RCU grace period to finish before freeing the category bitmaps
in smk_set_cipso(). This makes sure that there are no more readers using
the stale bitmaps and freeing them should be safe.

[ Upstream commit 7fae4c24a2b84a66c7be399727aca11e7a888462 ]

It turns out that a single page of stack is trivial to overflow with
all the tracing gunk enabled. Raise the exception stacks to 2 pages,
which is still half the interrupt stacks, which are at 4 pages.

From: Jonas Dreßler <verdre@v0yd.nl>

[ Upstream commit c2e9666cdffd347460a2b17988db4cfaf2a68fb9 ]

We currently handle changing from the P2P to the STATION virtual
interface type slightly different than changing from P2P to ADHOC: When
changing to STATION, we don't send the SET_BSS_MODE command. We do send
that command on all other type-changes though, and it probably makes
sense to send the command since after all we just changed our BSS_MODE.
Looking at prior changes to this part of the code, it seems that this is
simply a leftover from old refactorings.

Since sending the SET_BSS_MODE command is the only difference between
mwifiex_change_vif_to_sta_adhoc() and the current code, we can now use
mwifiex_change_vif_to_sta_adhoc() for both switching to ADHOC and
STATION interface type.

This does not fix any particular bug and just "looked right", so there's
a small chance it might be a regression.

From: Jonas Dreßler <verdre@v0yd.nl>

[ Upstream commit c606008b70627a2fc485732a53cc22f0f66d0981 ]

When creating a new virtual interface in mwifiex_add_virtual_intf(), we
update our internal driver states like bss_type, bss_priority, bss_role
and bss_mode to reflect the mode the firmware will be set to.

When switching virtual interface mode using
mwifiex_init_new_priv_params() though, we currently only update bss_mode
and bss_role. In order for the interface mode switch to actually work,
we also need to update bss_type to its proper value, so do that.

This fixes a crash of the firmware (because the driver tries to execute
commands that are invalid in AP mode) when switching from station mode
to AP mode.

[ Upstream commit 0961ba6dd211a4a52d1dd4c2d59be60ac2dc08c7 ]

To prevent corrupted frames after starting and stopping the sensor its
datasheet specifies a specific pause sequence to follow:

Stopping:
	Set Pause_Restart Bit -> Set Restart Bit -> Set Chip_Enable Off

Restarting:
	Set Chip_Enable On -> Clear Pause_Restart Bit

The Restart Bit is cleared automatically and must not be cleared
manually as this would cause undefined behavior.

[ Upstream commit dbb4cfea6efe979ed153bd59a6a527a90d3d0ab3 ]

The interrupt handling should be related to the firmware version. If
the driver matches an old firmware, then the driver should not handle
interrupt such as i2c or dma, otherwise it will cause some errors.

This log reveals it:

From: Tuo Li <islituo@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 8515965e5e33f4feb56134348c95953f3eadfb26 ]

The variable pdev is assigned to dev->plat_dev, and dev->plat_dev is
checked in:
  if (!dev->plat_dev)

This indicates both dev->plat_dev and pdev can be NULL. If so, the
function dev_err() is called to print error information.
  dev_err(&pdev->dev, "No platform data specified\n");

However, &pdev->dev is an illegal address, and it is dereferenced in
dev_err().

To fix this possible null-pointer dereference, replace dev_err() with
mfc_err().

If of_device_get_match_data() return NULL,
then null pointer dereference occurs in  s5p_mfc_init_pm().
The patch adds checking if dev->variant is NULL.

[ Upstream commit 476db72e521983ecb847e4013b263072bb1110fc ]

Syzkaller reported a warning called "rcu detected stall in dummy_timer".

The error seems to be an error in mceusb_dev_recv(). In the case of
-EPROTO error, the routine immediately resubmits the URB. Instead it
should return without resubmitting URB.

[ Upstream commit c15b5fc054c3d6c97e953617605235c5cb8ce979 ]

When CONFIG_PRINTK is not set, the CMPXCHG_BUGCHECK() macro calls
_printk(), but _printk() is a static inline function, not available
as an extern.
Since the purpose of the macro is to print the BUGCHECK info,
make this config option depend on PRINTK.

Fixes multiple occurrences of this build error:

../include/linux/printk.h:208:5: error: static declaration of '_printk' follows non-static declaration
  208 | int _printk(const char *s, ...)
      |     ^~~~~~~

[ Upstream commit d3c4b6f64ad356c0d9ddbcf73fa471e6a841cc5c ]

ACPICA commit 0762982923f95eb652cf7ded27356b247c9774de

During wakeup from system-wide sleep states, acpi_get_sleep_type_data()
is called and it tries to get memory from the slab allocator in order
to evaluate a control method, but if KFENCE is enabled in the kernel,
the memory allocation attempt causes an IRQ work to be queued and a
self-IPI to be sent to the CPU running the code which requires the
memory controller to be ready, so if that happens too early in the
wakeup path, it doesn't work.

Prevent that from taking place by calling acpi_get_sleep_type_data()
for S0 upfront, when preparing to enter a given sleep state, and
saving the data obtained by it for later use during system wakeup.

[ Upstream commit 899a61a3305d49e8a712e9ab20d0db94bde5929f ]

In dibusb_read_eeprom_byte(), if dibusb_i2c_msg() fails, val gets
assigned an value that's not properly initialized.
Using kzalloc() in place of kmalloc() for the buffer fixes this issue,
as the val can now be set to 0 in the event dibusb_i2c_msg() fails.

[ Upstream commit 49d67e445742bbcb03106b735b2ab39f6e5c56bc ]

The tracefs file system is by default mounted such that only root user can
access it. But there are legitimate reasons to create a group and allow
those added to the group to have access to tracing. By changing the
permissions of the tracefs mount point to allow access, it will allow
group access to the tracefs directory.

There should not be any real reason to allow all access to the tracefs
directory as it contains sensitive information. Have the default
permission of directories being created not have any OTH (other) bits set,
such that an admin that wants to give permission to a group has to first
disable all OTH bits in the file system.

[ Upstream commit 4b6012a7830b813799a7faf40daa02a837e0fd5b ]

kzalloc() is used to allocate memory for cd->detectors, and if it fails,
channel_detector_exit() behind the label fail will be called:
  channel_detector_exit(dpd, cd);

In channel_detector_exit(), cd->detectors is dereferenced through:
  struct pri_detector *de = cd->detectors[i];

To fix this possible null-pointer dereference, check cd->detectors before
the for loop to dereference cd->detectors.

[ Upstream commit 2835f327bd1240508db2c89fe94a056faa53c49a ]

Some buggy firmware and/or brand new batteries can support a charge that's
slightly over the reported design capacity. In such cases, the kernel will
report to userspace that the charging state of the battery is "Unknown",
when in reality the battery charge is "Full", at least from the design
capacity point of view. Make the fallback condition accepts capacities
over the designed capacity so userspace knows that is full.

[ Upstream commit cf2a85efdade117e2169d6e26641016cbbf03ef0 ]

For files that lack trailing newlines and match a leaking address (e.g.
wchan[1]), the leaking_addresses.pl report would run together with the
next line, making things look corrupted.

Unconditionally remove the newline on input, and write it back out on
output.

[ Upstream commit 738216c1953e802aa9f930c5d15b8f9092c847ff ]

In r592_remove(), the driver will free dma after freeing the host, which
may cause a UAF bug.

The following log reveals it:

[ Upstream commit 83d3c4f22a36d005b55f44628f46cc0d319a75e8 ]

With valid files, the safety margin described in lib/decompress_unxz.c
ensures that these buffers cannot overlap. But if the uncompressed size
of the input is larger than the caller thought, which is possible when
the input file is invalid/corrupt, the buffers can overlap. Obviously
the result will then be garbage (and usually the decoder will return
an error too) but no other harm will happen when such an over-run occurs.

This change only affects uncompressed LZMA2 chunks and so this
should have no effect on performance.

[ Upstream commit 4f8d7abaa413c34da9d751289849dbfb7c977d05 ]

This might matter, for example, if the underlying type of enum xz_check
was a signed char. In such a case the validation wouldn't have caught an
unsupported header. I don't know if this problem can occur in the kernel
on any arch but it's still good to fix it because some people might copy
the XZ code to their own projects from Linux instead of the upstream
XZ Embedded repository.

This change may increase the code size by a few bytes. An alternative
would have been to use an unsigned int instead of enum xz_check but
using an enumeration looks cleaner.

[ Upstream commit 7ce1bb83a14019f8c396d57ec704d19478747716 ]

If CONFIG_CFI_CLANG=y, attempting to read an event histogram will cause
the kernel to panic due to failed CFI check.

    1. echo 'hist:keys=common_pid' >> events/sched/sched_switch/trigger
    2. cat events/sched/sched_switch/hist
    3. kernel panics on attempting to read hist

This happens because the sort() function expects a generic
int (*)(const void *, const void *) pointer for the compare function.
To prevent this CFI failure, change tracing map cmp_entries_* function
signatures to match this.

[ Upstream commit 257051a235c17e33782b6e24a4b17f2d7915aaec ]

When the driver fails to request the firmware, it calls its error
handler. In the error handler, the driver detaches device from driver
first before releasing the firmware, which can cause a use-after-free bug.

Fix this by releasing firmware first.

The following log reveals it:

That happens because swsusp_check() calls set_blocksize() on the
target partition which confuses the file system:

       Thread1                       Thread2
mount /dev/sda /home/test
get s_mmp_bh  --> has mapped flag
start kmmpd thread

				    software_resume

					    truncate_cleanup_page

					        discard_buffer --> clean mapped flag
write_mmp_block
  submit_bh
    submit_bh_wbc
      BUG_ON(!buffer_mapped(bh))

To address this issue, modify swsusp_check() to open the target block
device with exclusive access.

[ Upstream commit e5322b9ab5f63536c41301150b7ce64605ce52cc ]

Just like we have default SMPS mode as dynamic in powersave,
we should not enable RX-diversity in powersave, to reduce
power consumption when connected to a non-MIMO AP.

syzbot is reporting kernel panic at smk_cipso_doi() due to memory
allocation fault injection [1]. The reason for need to use panic() was
not explained. But since no fix was proposed for 18 months, for now
let's use __GFP_NOFAIL for utilizing syzbot resource on other bugs.

From: Masami Hiramatsu <mhiramat@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit b3ea5d56f212ad81328c82454829a736197ebccc ]

Currently the stacktrace on clang compiled arm kernel uses the 'lr'
register to find the first frame address from pt_regs. However, that
is wrong after calling another function, because the 'lr' register
is used by 'bl' instruction and never be recovered.

As same as gcc arm kernel, directly use the frame pointer (r11) of
the pt_regs to find the first frame address.

Note that this fixes kretprobe stacktrace issue only with
CONFIG_UNWINDER_FRAME_POINTER=y. For the CONFIG_UNWINDER_ARM,
we need another fix.

[ Upstream commit 61e18ce7348bfefb5688a8bcd4b4d6b37c0f9b2a ]

When addr_gen_mode is set to IN6_ADDR_GEN_MODE_NONE, the link-local addr
should not be generated. But it isn't the case for GRE (as well as GRE6)
and SIT tunnels. Make it so that tunnels consider the addr_gen_mode,
especially for IN6_ADDR_GEN_MODE_NONE.

Do this in add_v4_addrs() to cover both GRE and SIT only if the addr
scope is link.

[ Upstream commit 345dac33f58894a56d17b92a41be10e16585ceff ]

When configuring the kernel for big-endian, we set either BE-8 or BE-32
based on the CPU architecture level. Until linux-4.4, we did not have
any ARMv7-M platform allowing big-endian builds, but now i.MX/Vybrid
is in that category, adn we get a build error because of this:

arch/arm/kernel/module-plts.c: In function 'get_module_plt':
arch/arm/kernel/module-plts.c:60:46: error: implicit declaration of function '__opcode_to_mem_thumb32' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]

This comes down to picking the wrong default, ARMv7-M uses BE8
like ARMv7-A does. Changing the default gets the kernel to compile
and presumably works.

[ Upstream commit 9cc2fa4f4a92ccc6760d764e7341be46ee8aaaa1 ]

The function end_of_stack() returns a pointer to the last entry of a
stack. For architectures like parisc where the stack grows upwards
return the pointer to the highest address in the stack.

Without this change I faced a crash on parisc, because the stackleak
functionality wrote STACKLEAK_POISON to the lowest address and thus
overwrote the first 4 bytes of the task_struct which included the
TIF_FLAGS.

From: Sven Schnelle <svens@stackframe.org>

[ Upstream commit 66e29fcda1824f0427966fbee2bd2c85bf362c82 ]

With idle polling, IPIs are not sent when a CPU idle, but queued
and run later from do_idle(). The default kgdb_call_nmi_hook()
implementation gets the pointer to struct pt_regs from get_irq_reqs(),
which doesn't work in that case because it was not called from the
IPI interrupt handler. Fix it by defining our own kgdb_roundup()
function which sents an IPI_ENTER_KGDB. When that IPI is received
on the target CPU kgdb_nmicallback() is called.

I won't insist on rejecting this one, but especially given this
sentence, this doesn't really pass the smell test for -stable
candidates. It's stuff like this that pushes me a bit toward the camp
of those who despise the ML-based selection methods here, even though
it occasionally (or even often) may produce some good.

I have hundreds of examples of patches that claim they are just an
improvement but fix a serious bug :)

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2006399#c0)  J. Bruce Fields    2021-09-21 16:25:02 UTC  ``` Allow an NFS server to mount and reexport a NFS filesystem, with some limitations.  This is already supported by the RHEL9 kernel, but it could use a little testing and documentation.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2006399#c1)  J. Bruce Fields    2021-09-21 16:37:28 UTC  ``` [https://lore.kernel.org/linux-nfs/20210921143259.GB21704@fieldses.org/](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-nfs/20210921143259.GB21704%40fieldses.org/) may be a starting point for documentation.  For upstream testing, I'm currently just reexporting and then running connectathon:  proxy# mkdir -p /exports/nfs proxy# mount server:/exports/xfs /exports/nfs proxy# echo "/exports/nfs/ *(rw,fsid=1234)" >/etc/exports proxy# systemctl start nfs-server  client# mount proxy:/exports/nfs /mnt/ client# cd cthon client# NFSTESTDIR=/mnt/TMP ./runtests -a -f  It's worth trying with various NFS versions (v3,v4,v4.1,v4.2).  The locking tests will fail on current RHEL9.  Patches to fix those last locking problems are upstream in 5.15.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2006399#c2)  Yongcheng Yang    2021-09-22 03:09:01 UTC  ``` Note to myself: the NFS re-export is marked as tech-preview in RHEL8 for now (see [Bug 1972229](show_bug.cgi?id=1972229)).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2006399#c3)  J. Bruce Fields    2021-10-26 15:32:10 UTC  ``` Changing the title; I want to make *very* sure we emphasize that there are some important limitations.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2006399#c4)  Dave Wysochanski    2021-11-15 18:32:17 UTC  ``` (In reply to J. Bruce Fields from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=2006399#c1)) > [https://lore.kernel.org/linux-nfs/20210921143259.GB21704@fieldses.org/](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-nfs/20210921143259.GB21704%40fieldses.org/) may > be a starting point for documentation. >   Bruce, what do you think about pulling in the documentation commit to RHEL9.0 GA since this is a new feature and it will explain the limitations right?  Then Red Hat docs can point at the official kernel tree rather than repeating the text there.  commit dc451bbc6f54a2c7bacef7ec445718709071b61c Author: J. Bruce Fields <bfields> Date:   Fri Sep 10 14:42:54 2021 -0400      nfs: reexport documentation          We've supported reexport for a while but documentation is limited.  This     is mainly a simplified version of the text I wrote for the linux-nfs     wiki at <https://wiki.linux-nfs.org/wiki/index.php/NFS_re-export>.          Signed-off-by: J. Bruce Fields <bfields>  diff --git a/Documentation/filesystems/nfs/index.rst b/Documentation/filesystems/nfs/index.rst   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2006399#c5)  J. Bruce Fields    2021-11-15 21:27:27 UTC  ``` (In reply to Dave Wysochanski from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=2006399#c4)) > Bruce, what do you think about pulling in the documentation commit to > RHEL9.0 GA since this is a new feature and it will explain the limitations > right?  Then Red Hat docs can point at the official kernel tree rather than > repeating the text there.  That sounds reasonable to me.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2006399#c8)  Dave Wysochanski    2022-03-18 19:37:38 UTC  ``` Marking for 9.1.0 for now as I'm not sure this is even going in 9.0   ```  [Comment 36](show_bug.cgi?id=2006399#c36)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-11-15 10:50:59 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

| **Name** | CVE-2021-3640 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | A flaw use-after-free in function sco\_sock\_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the way user calls ioct UFFDIO\_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco\_conn\_del() together with the call sco\_sock\_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system. |
