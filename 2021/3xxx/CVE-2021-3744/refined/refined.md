Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-3744:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is resource leaks in the `ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd()` function within the Linux kernel's `ccp` (AMD Cryptographic Coprocessor) driver. Specifically, three distinct bugs were identified.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Memory Leak on `src` initialization failure:** When the `ccp_init_data()` function fails for the source data (`&src`), allocated memory for additional authenticated data (`aad`) is not freed, leading to a leak. This is because the code incorrectly jumps to the `e_ctx` label instead of `e_aad`.
2.  **Incorrect label for freeing `final_wa`**: The label `e_tag` is used to free the `final_wa` memory. This label is incorrect, as the label should have been `e_final_wa`. Due to this naming issue, `&final_wa` is leaked.
3.  **Memory Leak on `tag` initialization failure**: The `tag` memory is leaked on a specific error path within the encryption block because the `ccp_dm_free(&tag)` was not called if `ccp_set_dm_area()` failed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can repeatedly trigger the vulnerable code path, causing a memory leak. This can eventually exhaust system memory, leading to a denial-of-service condition (memory consumption).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A local user can trigger the vulnerability by calling the `ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd()` function, which is used to support AMD's cryptographic co-processor, with specific parameters causing the described allocation failures.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a local user on a system running a vulnerable Linux kernel and using the affected `ccp` driver.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions up to 5.14.
*   The fix involves correcting the jump labels to free the resources properly in case of failures.
*   The issue was reported by a Tencent researcher.
*   The provided diff shows the changes made to correct the issues, including the correct goto label, correct freeing of `final_wa`, and freeing of `tag` when initialization fails.
