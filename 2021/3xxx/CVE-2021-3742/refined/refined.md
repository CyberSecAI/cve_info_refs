The provided content is a commit from chatwoot that addresses multiple security improvements. It does not directly relate to a specific vulnerability that has been assigned a CVE. The changes in this commit are preventative security measures rather than a fix for an existing exploit.

The commit includes the following security improvements:
*   **Devise auth tokens are reset on password update**: This change invalidates existing authentication tokens when a user changes their password, preventing unauthorized access using old tokens.
*   **Avatar attachment file type is limited to jpeg, gif, and png**: This limits the types of files that can be uploaded as avatars, preventing the upload of potentially malicious file types.
*   **Avatar attachment file size is limited to 15 MB**: This limits the size of avatar attachments, preventing denial-of-service through large file uploads.
*   **Widget Message attachments are limited to specific types**: This limits the file types that can be attached to widget messages, preventing the upload of potentially malicious file types. Allowed types are: `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/gif`, `image/bmp`, `image/tiff`, `application/pdf`, `audio/mpeg`, `video/mp4`, `audio/ogg`, `text/csv`.
*   **Widget Message attachments are limited to 40MB size limit**: This limits the size of widget message attachments, preventing denial-of-service through large file uploads.

While this commit improves the security of the application by limiting attachment types and sizes, and invalidating tokens, it doesn't address a specific vulnerability and is therefore **UNRELATED** to a specific CVE.
