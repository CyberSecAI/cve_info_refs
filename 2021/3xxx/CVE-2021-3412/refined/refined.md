*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and System Availability:** The vulnerability poses a threat to confidentiality, integrity, and the overall availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:**  Attackers can perform brute force attacks over the network by repeatedly sending login requests to the 3scale developer portal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the 3scale developer portal's login interface.
*   **Knowledge of Target:** No prior knowledge about specific usernames or passwords are required, as the attacker can guess them through brute force.
