Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-3355:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-supplied input within the `exclusive` field on the `/admin/SensitiveWords` page in LightCMS v1.3.4. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code that is then stored in the database and rendered on the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. Input provided via the `exclusive` field is not properly sanitized before being stored and later rendered in the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they visit the `/admin/SensitiveWords` page.
*   This could lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the web page
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Phishing attacks
    *   Credential theft
    *   Other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the web interface of the LightCMS application. An attacker must be able to log in to the admin interface.
*   The attacker crafts a malicious payload (e.g., `</span><img src=1 onerror=alert(1) /><span>`) and injects it into the `exclusive` field on the `/admin/SensitiveWords/create` page.
*   The payload is stored in the database and is triggered when a user visits `/admin/SensitiveWords`, due to the lack of output encoding.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a valid user account with access to the LightCMS admin panel.
*   They need to be able to navigate to the `/admin/SensitiveWords/create` page and input data.
*   No other special privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.
