Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3396:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of custom, targeted JEXL expressions within OpenNMS. This allows for the execution of arbitrary code by an authenticated user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** The primary weakness is the ability to execute code remotely through manipulated JEXL expressions.
- **Local Code Execution:** The vulnerability also allows local code execution.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate JEXL expressions, allowing malicious code to be embedded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows arbitrary code to be executed on the server, leading to a compromise of the system.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability also enables information disclosure which can be used to further compromise the system.
- **Complete compromise of the OpenNMS system:** The ability to execute arbitrary code and expose information would result in a full compromise of the server and its data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through various components that use JEXL expressions. These include:
    - OpenNMS Measurements API (ReST queries and filters)
    - OpenNMS Provisiond (IP address matching)
    - OpenNMS JMX monitor
    - OpenNMS thresholding
    - opennms:stress-events Karaf command (events:stress on older releases)
    - OpenNMS database reports sub-report rendering
    - OpenNMS storage strategies: JEXL index and object name
    - Newts web API

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to exploit this vulnerability.
