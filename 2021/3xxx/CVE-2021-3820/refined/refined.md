Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3820:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an inefficient regular expression used within the `inflect` library. Specifically, the issue is located in the `classify` function where a regular expression is used to process input, leading to a potential ReDoS attack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity (ReDoS):** The regular expression used in the `classify` function `util.string.gsub(table_name, /^.*\./, '')` is vulnerable to ReDoS. This means that crafted, malicious input strings can cause the regular expression engine to take an extremely long time to evaluate, potentially leading to denial-of-service conditions.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing a specially crafted input string, an attacker can cause the vulnerable application to spend an excessive amount of time processing the regular expression. This can lead to resource exhaustion and a denial-of-service condition, making the application unresponsive or unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, as the attacker can send crafted input to the vulnerable application over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **No privileges required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
*  **No user interaction:** Exploitation does not require any user interaction

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is in the `classify` function within the `lib/methods.js` file.
*   The fix involves modifying the regular expression from `/^.*\./` to `/.\*\./`.
*   The vulnerability affects versions of the `inflect` npm package prior to 0.3.7.
*   The CVSS v3 base score is 7.5, which is considered high.
*   The attack complexity is low.
