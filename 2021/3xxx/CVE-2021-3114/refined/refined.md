Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-3114:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

   - The content explicitly mentions "CVE-2021-3114" and states that the vulnerability is related to `crypto/elliptic: incorrect operations on the P-224 curve` which matches the official CVE description.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

   - The vulnerability stems from incorrect operations in the `p224Contract` function within the `crypto/elliptic/p224.go` file. Specifically, two bugs are identified:
     - **Incorrect `out3GT` calculation:** The `out3GT` mask was incorrectly set to "all ones" when the third limb of the value was greater *or equal to* the third limb of P, instead of just greater. This led to unnecessary subtraction by P in cases where the value was equal to P-1.
      - **Underflow of lowest limb:** After a conditional subtraction by P, a potential underflow of the lowest limb was not handled, leading to invalid outputs.
      - The commit log also explains "after the conditional subtraction by P, a potential underflow of the lowest limb was not handled. Any values that trigger the subtraction by P (values between P and 2^224-1, and P - 1 due to the bug above) but have a zero lowest limb would produce invalid outputs."

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

   - Incorrect field reduction in the P-224 curve implementation, leading to incorrect outputs.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

   - The vulnerability could result in the generation of incorrect outputs from the `P224().ScalarMult()` function.
   - This could lead to weak or broken cryptography if the incorrect outputs are used in cryptographic operations such as ECDSA signatures

**5. Attack vectors:**

   -  The vulnerability can be triggered by the use of P-224 ECDSA keys within the vulnerable `crypto/elliptic/p224.go` implementation in Go versions prior to 1.14.14 and 1.15.7.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

   - The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction.
   - The vulnerability can be triggered remotely over the network.
   - The attacker needs to be able to provide specific inputs, though the exact conditions are difficult to trace back to precise input values.

**Additional technical details:**

   - The GitHub commit log provides detailed information on the code changes and the specific bugs in the `p224Contract` function. It explains the issues with the `out3GT` calculation and the underflow in the lowest limb after a conditional subtraction.
   - The commit log also mentions the addition of a test suite for P-224 field arithmetic, including a custom fuzzer that helped discover the vulnerability quickly.
   - The fix for the vulnerability involves modifying the `p224Contract` function to accurately calculate `out3GT` and handle potential underflows correctly.
   - The information from the github commit log is more detailed than the official CVE description, providing a more technical understanding of the vulnerability

The information from the Gentoo security advisory (GLSA 202208-02) and the Fedora update (FEDORA-2021-e435a8bb88) also confirm the vulnerability in Go versions prior to 1.14.14 and 1.15.7. The Debian LTS advisory (DLA 2591-1) and (DSA 4848-1) also include CVE-2021-3114 along with other vulnerabilities fixed in respective versions.

The GitHub advisory (GHSA-gwfm-9vvh-63r3) provides a good description of the vulnerability and a good overview of the CVSS v3.1 metrics.

The provided content confirms that this vulnerability has a **moderate severity** (CVSS 6.5) and is remotely exploitable. It also mentions that the crypto/x509 and golang.org/x/crypto/ocsp (but not crypto/tls) packages are affected. The code fix has been released in Go versions 1.14.14, and 1.15.7 and later.
