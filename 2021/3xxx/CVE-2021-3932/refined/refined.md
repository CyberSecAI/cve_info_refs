The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository, specifically addressing a change in how logout links are handled in the Twill CMS. This commit introduces the use of POST requests for logout actions, enhancing security by preventing CSRF attacks. The commit includes changes across multiple files, including JavaScript files and Blade templates.

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

**Root cause of the vulnerability:**

The original implementation used GET requests for logout actions, which is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. A malicious actor could potentially trigger a logout by crafting a link and tricking a logged-in user to click it without their knowledge.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability with GET based logout.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could force a user to log out of the application against their will.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious link could be sent to a user that, when clicked, could log the user out of the application.
- CSRF attacks using other techniques.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to get a victim to visit a crafted URL.

**Specific changes in the commit:**
*   **`frontend/js/behaviors/logoutButton.js`**: Introduces a JavaScript function `logoutButton` that listens for clicks on elements with the `data-logout-btn` attribute. When clicked, it prevents the default action of the link, and instead submits a hidden form (with the POST method) that is present on the page with `data-logout-form` attribute.
*   **`frontend/js/main.js`**: Imports and initializes the new `logoutButton` behavior.
*   **`routes/auth.php`**: Adds a `POST` route for `/logout` to the application, ensuring that the logout endpoint can handle POST requests, instead of just GET. The original GET route is still kept for backwards compatibility.
*   **`views/layouts/main.blade.php`**: Adds a hidden form (with `POST` method) and the `data-logout-form` attribute. This form will be used by javascript `logoutButton()` function to submit logout.
*   **`views/partials/navigation/_overlay_navigation.blade.php`**: The original logout `<a>` tag with the `href` was replaced by an `<a>` tag with the `data-logout-btn` attribute.
*   **`views/partials/navigation/_user.blade.php`**: Similar to the above change, the original logout `<a>` tag with the `href` was replaced by an `<a>` tag with the `data-logout-btn` attribute.

This commit addresses the CSRF vulnerability associated with logout actions by using POST requests for logout actions, which prevents malicious requests being sent to logout the user.
