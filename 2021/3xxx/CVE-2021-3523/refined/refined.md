Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-3523:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how 3scale APICast reuses connections when forwarding requests to upstream APIs. It incorrectly identifies connections for reuse based on IP address alone.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Connection Reuse:** APICast reuses connections based solely on the IP address of the upstream API. It does not properly distinguish between different APIs hosted on the same IP address.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Due to the incorrect connection reuse, an attacker can bypass security restrictions associated with a specific API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Security Restriction Bypass:** An attacker can bypass security restrictions for an API request. This could allow unauthorized access to resources or functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Multiple APIs on Same IP:** The primary attack vector involves hosting multiple APIs on the same IP address.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to an APICast instance that is configured to forward requests to multiple APIs on the same IP address.

**Additional Details:**

* The bug report mentions that the issue is fixed in `3scale-apicast 2.11.0`
*  The bug report confirms that this issue is related to connection reuse based on the IP address.
