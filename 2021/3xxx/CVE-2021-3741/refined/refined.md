Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to security improvements in the Chatwoot API:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The commit addresses multiple security issues related to file uploads and authentication:
1.  **Insecure File Uploads:** Lack of proper validation on file types and sizes for attachments in both widget messages and user avatars. This could lead to users uploading malicious files or excessively large files that could cause denial-of-service or other issues.
2.  **Session Management:** Insecure session management due to tokens not being invalidated on password update.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Unrestricted File Types:** Before the patch, there were no restrictions on the types of files that could be uploaded as attachments to messages or user avatars.
2.  **Unrestricted File Sizes:** No limit on the file sizes of message attachments or avatars.
3.  **Session Persistence after Password Change:** Existing authentication tokens were not invalidated when a user changed their password, potentially leaving old sessions active.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **Malware Upload:** An attacker could upload malicious files disguised as images or other acceptable formats, potentially compromising user devices or the server.
2.  **Denial of Service:** Attackers could upload extremely large files, consuming storage space or bandwidth. This could lead to service disruptions and increased operational costs.
3.  **Unauthorized Access:**  A compromised accountâ€™s session tokens could remain active even after the user changed their password, allowing attackers to maintain access to the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **File Upload:** Attackers could exploit the file upload functionality via the web widget or by directly interacting with the API to upload malicious or oversized files.
2.  **Password Reset:** An attacker could potentially maintain unauthorized access by exploiting the lack of token invalidation upon password change.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Public Access:** An attacker does not require any special privileges to exploit this, as the widget message attachment and avatar upload functions are accessible to users of the platform.
2. **Account Access (post-password reset):**  An attacker needs access to an active session/token to take advantage of the lack of token invalidation.

**Changes Introduced by the Patch:**
*   **File Type Restrictions:**
    *   Avatar attachments are limited to `jpeg`, `gif`, and `png`.
    *   Widget message attachments are limited to `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/gif`, `image/bmp`, `image/tiff`, `application/pdf`, `audio/mpeg`, `video/mp4`, `audio/ogg`, and `text/csv`.
*   **File Size Limits:**
    *   Avatar attachment file size is limited to 15 MB.
    *   Widget message attachments are limited to 40 MB.
*   **Session Invalidation:** Devise authentication tokens are now reset when a user updates their password.

This commit aims to enhance the security of the application by adding necessary file type and size validations, and by invalidating sessions to prevent unauthorized access after password changes.
