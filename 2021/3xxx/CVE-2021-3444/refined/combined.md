Subject: [CVE-2021-3444] Linux kernel bpf verifier incorrect mod32 truncation

Hello,

CVE-2021-3444 - Linux kernel bpf verifier incorrect mod32 truncation

Recently, it was discovered that bpf verifier in the Linux kernel
did not properly handle mod32 destination register truncation when
the source register was known to be 0. De4dCr0w of 360 Alpha Lab
discovered that this vulnerability could be turned into out-of-bounds
reads in the kernel, and out-of-bounds writes can not be ruled out.

It was fixed in upstream commit:

  9b00f1b78809 ("bpf: Fix truncation handling for mod32 dst reg wrt zero")

and also landed in the 5.11.2, 5.10.19, and 5.4.101 stable kernels.

The commit itself references

  468f6eafa6c4 ("bpf: fix 32-bit ALU op verification") (v4.15-rc5)

as introducing the issue, but further analysis seemed to indicate that

  f6b1b3bf0d5f ("bpf: fix subprog verifier bypass by div/mod by 0 exception") (v4.16-rc1)

was also necessary to take advantage of the vulnerability.

Thanks.

bpf: Fix truncation handling for mod32 dst reg wrt zeroRecently noticed that when mod32 with a known src reg of 0 is performed,
then the dst register is 32-bit truncated in verifier:
0: R1=ctx(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R10=fp0
0: (b7) r0 = 0
1: R0\_w=inv0 R1=ctx(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R10=fp0
1: (b7) r1 = -1
2: R0\_w=inv0 R1\_w=inv-1 R10=fp0
2: (b4) w2 = -1
3: R0\_w=inv0 R1\_w=inv-1 R2\_w=inv4294967295 R10=fp0
3: (9c) w1 %= w0
4: R0\_w=inv0 R1\_w=inv(id=0,umax\_value=4294967295,var\_off=(0x0; 0xffffffff)) R2\_w=inv4294967295 R10=fp0
4: (b7) r0 = 1
5: R0\_w=inv1 R1\_w=inv(id=0,umax\_value=4294967295,var\_off=(0x0; 0xffffffff)) R2\_w=inv4294967295 R10=fp0
5: (1d) if r1 == r2 goto pc+1
R0\_w=inv1 R1\_w=inv(id=0,umax\_value=4294967295,var\_off=(0x0; 0xffffffff)) R2\_w=inv4294967295 R10=fp0
6: R0\_w=inv1 R1\_w=inv(id=0,umax\_value=4294967295,var\_off=(0x0; 0xffffffff)) R2\_w=inv4294967295 R10=fp0
6: (b7) r0 = 2
7: R0\_w=inv2 R1\_w=inv(id=0,umax\_value=4294967295,var\_off=(0x0; 0xffffffff)) R2\_w=inv4294967295 R10=fp0
7: (95) exit
7: R0=inv1 R1=inv(id=0,umin\_value=4294967295,umax\_value=4294967295,var\_off=(0x0; 0xffffffff)) R2=inv4294967295 R10=fp0
7: (95) exit
However, as a runtime result, we get 2 instead of 1, meaning the dst
register does not contain (u32)-1 in this case. The reason is fairly
straight forward given the 0 test leaves the dst register as-is:
# ./bpftool p d x i 23
0: (b7) r0 = 0
1: (b7) r1 = -1
2: (b4) w2 = -1
3: (16) if w0 == 0x0 goto pc+1
4: (9c) w1 %= w0
5: (b7) r0 = 1
6: (1d) if r1 == r2 goto pc+1
7: (b7) r0 = 2
8: (95) exit
This was originally not an issue given the dst register was marked as
completely unknown (aka 64 bit unknown). However, after 468f6eafa6c4
("bpf: fix 32-bit ALU op verification") the verifier casts the register
output to 32 bit, and hence it becomes 32 bit unknown. Note that for
the case where the src register is unknown, the dst register is marked
64 bit unknown. After the fix, the register is truncated by the runtime
and the test passes:
# ./bpftool p d x i 23
0: (b7) r0 = 0
1: (b7) r1 = -1
2: (b4) w2 = -1
3: (16) if w0 == 0x0 goto pc+2
4: (9c) w1 %= w0
5: (05) goto pc+1
6: (bc) w1 = w1
7: (b7) r0 = 1
8: (1d) if r1 == r2 goto pc+1
9: (b7) r0 = 2
10: (95) exit
Semantics also match with {R,W}x mod{64,32} 0 -> {R,W}x. Invalid div
has always been {R,W}x div{64,32} 0 -> 0. Rewrites are as follows:
mod32: mod64:
(16) if w0 == 0x0 goto pc+2 (15) if r0 == 0x0 goto pc+1
(9c) w1 %= w0 (9f) r1 %= r0
(05) goto pc+1
(bc) w1 = w1

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2020-3702

    A flaw was found in the driver for Atheros IEEE 802.11n family of
    chipsets (ath9k) allowing information disclosure.

CVE-2020-16119

    Hadar Manor reported a use-after-free in the DCCP protocol
    implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker can take
    advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service or potentially
    to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2021-3444, CVE-2021-3600

    Two flaws were discovered in the Extended BPF (eBPF) verifier.  A
    local user could exploit these to read and write arbitrary memory
    in the kernel, which could be used for privilege escalation.

    This can be mitigated by setting sysctl
    kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1, which disables eBPF use by
    unprivileged users.

CVE-2021-3612

    Murray McAllister reported a flaw in the joystick input subsystem.
    A local user permitted to access a joystick device could exploit
    this to read and write out-of-bounds in the kernel, which could
    be used for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3653

   Maxim Levitsky discovered a vulnerability in the KVM hypervisor
   implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel: Missing
   validation of the `int_ctl` VMCB field could allow a malicious L1
   guest to enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt
   Controller) for the L2 guest. The L2 guest can take advantage of
   this flaw to write to a limited but still relatively large subset
   of the host physical memory.

CVE-2021-3655

    Ilja Van Sprundel and Marcelo Ricardo Leitner found multiple flaws
    in the SCTP implementation, where missing validation could lead to
    an out-of-bounds read.  On a system using SCTP, a networked
    attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-3656

    Maxim Levitsky and Paolo Bonzini discovered a flaw in the KVM
    hypervisor implementation for AMD processors in the Linux
    kernel. Missing validation of the `virt_ext` VMCB field could
    allow a malicious L1 guest to disable both VMLOAD/VMSAVE
    intercepts and VLS (Virtual VMLOAD/VMSAVE) for the L2 guest. Under
    these circumstances, the L2 guest is able to run VMLOAD/VMSAVE
    unintercepted and thus read/write portions of the host's physical
    memory.

CVE-2021-3679

    A flaw in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality could
    allow a privileged local user (with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) to
    cause a denial of service (resource starvation).

CVE-2021-3732

    Alois Wohlschlager reported a flaw in the implementation of the
    overlayfs subsystem, allowing a local attacker with privileges to
    mount a filesystem to reveal files hidden in the original mount.

CVE-2021-3743

    An out-of-bounds memory read was discovered in the Qualcomm IPC
    router protocol implementation, allowing to cause a denial of
    service or information leak.

CVE-2021-3753

    Minh Yuan reported a race condition in the vt_k_ioctl in
    drivers/tty/vt/vt_ioctl.c, which may cause an out of bounds read
    in vt.

CVE-2021-22543

    David Stevens discovered a flaw in how the KVM hypervisor maps
    host memory into a guest.  A local user permitted to access
    /dev/kvm could use this to cause certain pages to be freed when
    they should not, leading to a use-after-free.  This could be used
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-33624, CVE-2021-34556, CVE-2021-35477

    Multiple researchers discovered flaws in the Extended BPF (eBPF)
    verifier's protections against information leaks through
    speculation execution.  A local user could exploit these to read
    sensitive information.

    This can be mitigated by setting sysctl
    kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1, which disables eBPF use by
    unprivileged users.

CVE-2021-35039

    A flaw was discovered in module signature enforcement.  A custom
    kernel with IMA enabled might have allowed loading unsigned kernel
    modules when it should not have.

CVE-2021-37159

    A flaw was discovered in the hso driver for Option mobile
    broadband modems.  An error during initialisation could lead to a
    double-free or use-after-free.  An attacker able to plug in USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly to run arbitrary code.

CVE-2021-38160

    A flaw in the virtio_console was discovered allowing data
    corruption or data loss by an untrusted device.

CVE-2021-38198

    A flaw was discovered in the KVM implementation for x86
    processors, that could result in virtual memory protection within
    a guest not being applied correctly.  When shadow page tables are
    used - i.e. for nested virtualisation, or on CPUs lacking the EPT
    or NPT feature - a user of the guest OS might be able to exploit
    this for denial of service or privilege escalation within the
    guest.

CVE-2021-38199

    Michael Wakabayashi reported a flaw in the NFSv4 client
    implementation, where incorrect connection setup ordering allows
    operations of a remote NFSv4 server to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2021-38205

    An information leak was discovered in the xilinx_emaclite network
    driver.  On a custom kernel where this driver is enabled and used,
    this might make it easier to exploit other kernel bugs.

CVE-2021-40490

    A race condition was discovered in the ext4 subsystem when writing
    to an inline_data file while its xattrs are changing. This could
    result in denial of service.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.208-1~deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.19 packages.

Subject: [CVE-2021-3444] Linux kernel bpf verifier incorrect mod32 truncation

Hello,

CVE-2021-3444 - Linux kernel bpf verifier incorrect mod32 truncation

Recently, it was discovered that bpf verifier in the Linux kernel
did not properly handle mod32 destination register truncation when
the source register was known to be 0. De4dCr0w of 360 Alpha Lab
discovered that this vulnerability could be turned into out-of-bounds
reads in the kernel, and out-of-bounds writes can not be ruled out.

It was fixed in upstream commit:

  9b00f1b78809 ("bpf: Fix truncation handling for mod32 dst reg wrt zero")

and also landed in the 5.11.2, 5.10.19, and 5.4.101 stable kernels.

The commit itself references

  468f6eafa6c4 ("bpf: fix 32-bit ALU op verification") (v4.15-rc5)

as introducing the issue, but further analysis seemed to indicate that

  f6b1b3bf0d5f ("bpf: fix subprog verifier bypass by div/mod by 0 exception") (v4.16-rc1)

was also necessary to take advantage of the vulnerability.

Thanks.
