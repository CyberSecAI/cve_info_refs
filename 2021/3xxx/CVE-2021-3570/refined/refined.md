{
  "CVE-2021-3570": {
    "Description": "The ptp4l program in linuxptp, an implementation of the Precision Time Protocol (PTP), does not validate the messageLength field of incoming messages, allowing a remote attacker to cause a denial of service, information leak, or potentially remote code execution.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Missing length check when forwarding a PTP message between ports.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The `messageLength` field from a received PTP message is used without proper validation, leading to potential buffer overflows."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service, information leak, or potentially remote code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can send a crafted PTP message over the network to exploit the vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to send crafted PTP messages to a vulnerable `ptp4l` instance."
  }
