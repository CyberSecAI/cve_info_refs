Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3224:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization of the `content` parameter in the `/admin/pages/new` page of the cszcms 1.2.9 application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This occurs because the application does not filter user-supplied input within the `content` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploit could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the affected page. This could lead to various impacts:
*   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker could steal session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Malicious Actions:**  The attacker could perform actions on behalf of a user without their knowledge, such as modifying data, creating new users, or deleting content.
*   **Phishing:** The attacker could redirect users to phishing pages, aiming to steal their credentials.
*   **Defacement:** The attacker could deface the website, displaying unwanted content.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `/admin/pages/new` endpoint of the cszcms 1.2.9 application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have access to the `/admin/pages/new` page of the application, implying that the attacker would require valid administrative or editor credentials to create a new page in the system. They would also need to craft a malicious payload containing JavaScript.

**Additional notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in version 1.2.9 of the cszcms application.
*   The issue was reported on GitHub in issue #28 of the cskaza/cszcms repository.
*   The vulnerability is considered to have a moderate severity.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2021-3224.
*   The issue was reported to be fixed in a later version. However, the specific fixed version is not provided in the advisory.

**Summary:**
CVE-2021-3224 describes a stored XSS vulnerability in cszcms 1.2.9. The application fails to sanitize user-provided input in the content parameter of the `/admin/pages/new` page. This allows attackers with sufficient privileges to inject malicious JavaScript that can compromise user accounts and website integrity.
