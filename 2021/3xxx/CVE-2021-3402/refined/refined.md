Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3402:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a combination of an integer overflow and multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities within the `libyara/modules/macho/macho.c` file of the YARA library when parsing Mach-O files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Integer Overflow:**
    *   An integer overflow exists in the `macho_parse_fat_file()` function when calculating the size of a Mach-O file within a fat binary.
    *   Specifically, the addition of `arch.offset + arch.size` can overflow, leading to a wraparound, which bypasses the size check (`size < arch.offset + arch.size`).

2.  **Out-of-bounds Reads:**
    *   Multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities are present in various functions:
        *   `macho_parse_file()`: Incorrect sanity checks in loops processing segments and commands cause out-of-bounds reads.
        *   `macho_handle_segment_64()` and `macho_handle_segment()`:  These functions read a fixed number of bytes using `memcpy` without checking the size of the buffer, leading to out-of-bounds reads.
        *   `macho_handle_unixthread()`: Multiple out-of-bounds reads occur:
            *   When skipping `sizeof(yr_thread_command_t)` bytes without verifying enough data is available.
            *   When reading the thread state for various architectures, without checking if enough bytes exist for the corresponding `yr_*_thread_state_t` object.
        *   `macho_is_32()`:  This function is called without checking if the buffer `size` is at least 4 bytes which results in an out of bound read if `size` < 4.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The vulnerabilities can lead to denial of service through crashes caused by invalid memory accesses or by triggering a large stack consumption.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Out-of-bounds reads can potentially leak sensitive information from memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the parsing of a malicious Mach-O file. The attacker crafts a Mach-O file that triggers the integer overflow or out-of-bounds read conditions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide the specially crafted malicious Mach-O file to be processed by a vulnerable version of the YARA library.
*   No special privileges are required. The attacker just needs the ability to cause a vulnerable system to scan a malicious file with YARA.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by X41 D-Sec GmbH.
*   The issue is present in YARA versions 4.0.3 and earlier.
*   YARA version 4.0.4 contains the fix.
*   The provided information includes code snippets showing the vulnerable locations and recommended fixes.
