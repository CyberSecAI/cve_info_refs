Replaces `escape_rdn` with `escape_filter_chars`.

I've just replaced the function names but I think this one is redundant.

The thing is that, following that flow, `login` would go through `escape_filter_chars` twice.

```
>>> from ldap3.utils.conv import escape_filter_chars
>>> escape_filter_chars("test ()")
'test \\28\\29'
>>> escape_filter_chars(escape_filter_chars("test ()"))
'test \\5c28\\5c29'
```

I'd get rid of the one pointed here to maintain what the user has provided in case it's going to be used somewhere else in the future.
