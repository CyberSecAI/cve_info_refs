- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authorization in Cortex XSOAR allows users with investigation read permissions to download files from incident investigations they are aware of but not a part of.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authorization (CWE-285).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with low privileges and investigation read permissions can download files from incident investigations they shouldn't have access to, leading to a low confidentiality impact.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An authenticated network-based attacker with investigation read permissions is required. User interaction is also needed (High attack complexity).
