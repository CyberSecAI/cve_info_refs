- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of exceptional conditions in the PAN-OS dataplane.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in how PAN-OS handles exceptional conditions when processing network traffic, specifically with regards to GTP security.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by sending crafted network traffic through the firewall. Repeated attempts can crash the service and force the device into maintenance mode, disrupting all PAN-OS services.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks via specifically crafted traffic sent through the firewall.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated attacker on the network can exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to send traffic to a PAN-OS firewall that has GTP security configured.
