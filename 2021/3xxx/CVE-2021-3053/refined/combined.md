### Description

An improper handling of exceptional conditions vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS dataplane that enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to send specifically crafted traffic through the firewall that causes the service to crash. Repeated attempts to send this request result in denial of service to all PAN-OS services by restarting the device and putting it into maintenance mode.

This issue impacts:

PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.20;

PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.14;

PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.9;

PAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.5.

This issue does not affect Prisma Access.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 10.1 | None | 10.1.\* |
| PAN-OS 10.0 | < 10.0.5 | >= 10.0.5 |
| PAN-OS 9.1 | < 9.1.9 | >= 9.1.9 |
| PAN-OS 9.0 | < 9.0.14 | >= 9.0.14 |
| PAN-OS 8.1 | < 8.1.20 | >= 8.1.20 |

### Required Configuration for Exposure

This issue is applicable only if GTP security is configured on the firewall.

### Severity: HIGH

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
7.5 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H))

### Exploitation Status

Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this issue.

### Weakness Type

[CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/755 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/755")

### Solution

This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.20, PAN-OS 9.0.14, PAN-OS 9.1.9, PAN-OS 10.0.5, and all later PAN-OS versions.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

Enable signatures for Unique Threat ID 91593 on traffic processed by the firewall to block attacks against CVE-2021-3053.

### Acknowledgments

This issue was found by Nicholas Newsom of Palo Alto Networks during internal security review.
