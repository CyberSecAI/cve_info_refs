- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the NXP A700X chip's implementation of ECDSA signatures used in the Google Titan Security Key. Specifically, the electromagnetic radiations emitted during the ECDSA signature process leak information about the ephemeral key.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Side-channel leakage: The primary weakness is the leakage of sensitive information via electromagnetic emanations during ECDSA operations.
    - Vulnerable cryptographic library: Older versions of NXP's cryptographic library (up to v2.9) used by the impacted secure microcontrollers are vulnerable.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can recover the long-term ECDSA private key linked to a FIDO U2F account, allowing them to clone the security key. This effectively bypasses the two-factor authentication provided by the device.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack is a side-channel attack that involves the following:
    - Physical access to the security key
    - Observation and capture of the electromagnetic radiation emitted during ECDSA operations.
    - Analysis of the captured side-channel signals using machine learning.
    - Lattice-based attack to recover the private key.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Physical access to the target device.
    - Expensive equipment to capture electromagnetic emanations.
    - Custom software for signal analysis and key recovery.
    - Technical skills in signal processing, machine learning, and cryptography.
