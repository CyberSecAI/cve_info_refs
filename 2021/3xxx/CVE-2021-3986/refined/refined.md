The provided content is related to a commit in the `calibre-web` repository on GitHub. However, it does not describe a vulnerability. The commit message indicates a change to an error message when deleting a shelf without authorization. The code diff shows changes in `cps/db.py` and `cps/shelf.py`.

Specifically, the commit addresses:

1.  **Error Message Clarity:** The commit modifies how unauthorized actions are reported when attempting to add or remove books from a shelf. Instead of showing the shelf name in the error message, the code removes it. It standardizes error messages by not revealing the name of the shelf.

   -   **Vulnerability:** There is no clear vulnerability, it appears to be an information disclosure issue, where the shelf name might reveal internal information. This is unlikely to be exploitable.
    - **Root Cause:** The previous implementation included the shelf name in the error messages.
    - **Weaknesses:** Potential information disclosure of the shelf name.
    - **Impact:** Minimal, slight information leak, no direct impact.
    - **Attack Vectors:** An attacker who is unauthorized for an action may see the shelf name if they trigger this error message.
    - **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to attempt to add or remove books from a shelf they don't have permissions to.

The commit does not introduce or fix a security vulnerability, but rather improves the user experience and prevents minor information leaks in error messages.
