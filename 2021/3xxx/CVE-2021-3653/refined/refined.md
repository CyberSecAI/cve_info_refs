  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "Missing validation of the `int_ctl` VMCB field in the KVM hypervisor implementation for AMD processors, which allows a malicious L1 guest to enable AVIC support for the L2 guest.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "Missing security checks"
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious L1 guest can enable AVIC support for the L2 guest, leading to the L2 guest being able to read/write a subset of the host physical memory. This can result in a crash of the entire system, a leak of sensitive data, or a guest-to-host escape.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A malicious L1 guest enabling AVIC support for L2 guest"
       ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control an L1 guest and to be able to manipulate VMCB fields passed to the hypervisor.",
      "additional_info": "The vulnerability dates back to kernel 2.6.30 and was introduced in commit <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/3d6368ef580a>. AVIC is not supported with nesting and it is not advertised in the L1 CPUID.\nThe affected systems include Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 and 7.4 Advanced Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.1 Extended Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Extended Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 Advanced Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 Telco Extended Update Support and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 Update Services for SAP Solutions, Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Real Time 7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Real Time for NFV 7, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Real Time 8, Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Real Time for NFV 8 . Mitigation can be achieved by disabling nested virtualization with `modprobe kvm_amd nested=0`"
