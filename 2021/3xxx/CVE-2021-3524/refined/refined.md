RELATED: CVE-2021-3524

Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of newline characters within the CORS ExposeHeader tag in the Ceph Object Gateway (RGW).

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- HTTP header injection via newline characters (\n and \r) in the CORS ExposeHeader tag.
- The RGW doesn't properly neutralize untrusted input in the ExposeHeader tag.

Impact of exploitation:
- An attacker can inject arbitrary HTTP headers, such as 'Set-Cookie', which could lead to potential XSS attacks and other security compromises.
- Allows for injection of arbitrary headers in responses when CORS requests are made.
- Could lead to setting of arbitrary cookies.

Attack vectors:
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a CORS request to an Amazon S3 bucket with a maliciously crafted CORS configuration.
- An attacker can create a publicly accessible S3 bucket with a malicious CORS configuration to inject headers for anyone accessing that bucket.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- An attacker needs to be able to modify the CORS configuration of an Amazon S3 bucket in Ceph RGW
- Knowledge of how CORS and HTTP header injection work
- No specific position is required if the attacker can create or modify the bucket configuration.
