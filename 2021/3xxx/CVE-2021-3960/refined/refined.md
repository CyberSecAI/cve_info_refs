- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory ('Path Traversal') in the UpdateServer component of Bitdefender GravityZone.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability allowing the execution of arbitrary code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on vulnerable instances of Bitdefender GravityZone.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is located in the UpdateServer component of Bitdefender GravityZone, specifically in the `productManager UpdateServer.KitsManager API`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need privileges (PR:N) and no user interaction is required (UI:N). The attack occurs locally (AV:L) and the scope is changed (S:C) meaning the impact could spread across the system.
