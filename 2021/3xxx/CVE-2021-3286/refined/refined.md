Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3286:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2021-3286. It includes:

-   A GitHub issue ([#653](https://github.com/spotweb/spotweb/issues/653)) specifically titled "CVE-2021-3286 - SQL injection incomplete fix".
-   A GitHub Advisory Database entry for CVE-2021-3286. This entry confirms the SQL injection vulnerability and links to issue #653.
-   Reference to CVE-2020-35545, the original vulnerability for which the fix was incomplete.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in Spotweb 1.4.9. This arises due to an inadequate input sanitization mechanism. The initial fix for CVE-2020-35545 (a previous SQL injection vulnerability) was incomplete, employing a blacklist and regex to filter malicious input. Attackers were able to bypass the filter with variations of the original exploit payload.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Incomplete Fix:** The fix for the original CVE-2020-35545 vulnerability was not comprehensive and could be bypassed.
    *   **Blacklisting:** Use of a blacklist approach instead of a whitelist for input sanitization.
    *  **Inadequate Input Filtering:**  The filtering mechanism using regex was not sufficient to prevent SQL injection.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or other forms of unauthorized access and control over the application's database.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is the application's query string, specifically related to user input to the application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the Spotweb application containing malicious SQL payloads. No special privileges or internal access seems necessary, based on the information.

**3. Additional Information:**

-   The GitHub issue discussion highlights the developers' awareness of the limitations of their current filtering approach and the need for parameterized queries (using prepared statements) as a more robust solution.
-   There's a discussion on why parameterized queries couldn't be easily implemented due to the way Spotweb's filters operate.
-   The issue was ultimately closed as "completed" not because it was fixed but because it was deemed 'unfixable' with the current filtering mechanisms and architecture of the application.
-   The initial fix ([fefb39a](https://github.com/spotweb/spotweb/commit/fefb39ad143caad021ad496427617db79c42aff2) / [25c1f89](https://github.com/spotweb/spotweb/commit/25c1f89f0202af5d5d224b906ff9d9313f017aa6)) attempted to blacklist characters.
-   A subsequent commit ([224d33e](https://github.com/spotweb/spotweb/commit/224d33eebf5ad8a57c60203ab4b995307f67fc10)) was made to update `Dao_Base_Spot.php` related to this issue.
-   This issue was re-reported after the initial "fix" was bypassed.
-   The vulnerability was initially reported to the project maintainers by the Debian LTS Team.

**Summary of Vulnerability:**

CVE-2021-3286 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability in Spotweb 1.4.9. The root cause was an incomplete and ineffective input filtering mechanism, specifically a blacklist approach, implemented after a previous SQLi vulnerability (CVE-2020-35545).  Attackers can bypass the inadequate filtering and execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially causing significant damage.

The content provides more technical details than the standard CVE description. It gives a good background, shows the developer's discussion of the issue, and indicates that there is no full fix for the issue as the developers cannot use prepared statements with the current filtering system.
