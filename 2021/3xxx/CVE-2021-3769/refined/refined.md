The provided content is related to CVE-2021-3769.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `pygmalion`, `pygmalion-virtualenv`, and `refined` themes in ohmyzsh unsafely handle git prompt information, leading to a double evaluation of this information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command injection vulnerability due to double evaluation of git prompt information.
- The themes use `git_prompt_info` which is then used unsafely in the prompt definition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious git repository could trigger command injection if a user clones and enters the repository.
- This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the user's system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Cloning a malicious git repository
- Entering the directory of a malicious repository.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious git repository.
- The user must clone the malicious repository and enter the repository directory.
