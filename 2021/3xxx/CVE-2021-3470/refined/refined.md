  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The `zmalloc_size()` function incorrectly assumed that the heap allocator always returns blocks that are long-padded, which may not be the case on systems without `malloc_usable_size()`. This leads to `zmalloc_size()` returning a size larger than the actual allocated memory block.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Heap overflow",
        "Out-of-bounds write"
      ],
      "impact": "An out-of-bounds write leading to a process crash and a potential security vulnerability.",
      "attack_vectors": "By triggering an allocation on a system using a heap allocator other than jemalloc or glibc's malloc, where the allocated block is not long-padded.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need to control the allocation size and trigger this allocation through normal redis usage on an affected system."
