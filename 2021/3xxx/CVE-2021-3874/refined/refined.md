Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit `7224fbcc89f00f2b71644e36bb1b1d96addd1d5a`:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The application was vulnerable to path traversal attacks during file system operations related to attachments and images. Specifically, when exporting content to HTML, it was possible to access files outside of the intended storage directories (within `storage/`) by using relative path references like `../` in the file paths of the attachments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability was the lack of proper input sanitization and validation of file paths, allowing attackers to manipulate paths to access arbitrary files on the server's filesystem.
- **Insecure File Storage:** The way local files were handled, especially during HTML exports, lacked sufficient safeguards to ensure files within the `storage/` folder could not be accessed via path traversal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive files on the server's file system. This could include configuration files, database credentials, source code, or other private data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulated File Paths:** By crafting a document with manipulated file paths (e.g., using `..` sequences), an attacker could force the application to access files outside the intended directories. This would be triggered during HTML export.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be a user capable of creating/editing content that would trigger the vulnerability during HTML export.
- They would need to be able to inject manipulated file paths into the content of the application.
- No information on authentication/authorization requirements for this exploit is given.

**Mitigation:**
The commit addresses this vulnerability using the following two-layer approach:

1.  **Scoped Local Filesystems:**  It scopes the local Flysystem filesystems down to specific image and file folders. Flysystem has built-in checks to prevent escaping the root folder which mitigates path traversal in the filesystem layer.
2.  **Path Normalization:**  Before enforcing the `uploads/{images,file}` prefix, the code now performs path normalization to prevent traversal at the path level, using `Util::normalizePath()` and removing the `uploads/files/` or `uploads/images/` prefixes before checking the storage location.

This commit provides more details than the original CVE description by specifying the exact location of the vulnerability, the attack vector and the mitigation.
