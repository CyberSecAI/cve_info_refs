**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is that the Keycloak password is exposed within Unisys Stealth versions prior to 6.0.025.0. The specific mechanism of the exposure is not detailed, but the report indicates a configuration issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Credentials Exposure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of the Keycloak password. This constitutes a significant security flaw.
*   **CWE-257 (Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format):** This CWE indicates that passwords may be stored in a way that allows retrieval, potentially in plaintext or easily reversible form.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **High Impact:** The vulnerability is rated as HIGH, with significant potential consequences.
*   **System Access:** An attacker could gain access to the Management Server.
*   **Configuration Modification:** The attacker could change the Stealth configuration, potentially leading to full compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The CVSS vector `AV:L` indicates that the attack vector is local. This suggests that the attacker must already have some form of access to the system where the vulnerable Stealth instance is running.
* **Privileged Access:** The CVSS vector `PR:H` indicates that the attacker requires high privileges to exploit the vulnerability. This implies the vulnerability is not exploitable without elevated user rights.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local System Access:** The attacker must have some level of access to the system where the affected Stealth instance is installed.
*   **High Privileges:** The attacker requires high privileges on the affected system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Stealth versions below 6.0.025.0.
*   The vendor recommends upgrading to Stealth version 6.0.025.0 or above as the remediation.
*   There is no workaround for this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was internally reported to Unisys.
