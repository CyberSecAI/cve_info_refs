           "additional_details": "The vulnerability is located in the `cli_feat_read_cb` function within `gatt-database.c`. The issue arises because the `offset` variable, provided by an external source, isn't validated before accessing memory using the formula `&state->cli_feat[offset]`. Specifically, when `offset` is larger than the size of `state->cli_feat`, an out-of-bounds memory access occurs. The fix involves adding a check to ensure that offset is within the bounds of `state->cli_feat`."
