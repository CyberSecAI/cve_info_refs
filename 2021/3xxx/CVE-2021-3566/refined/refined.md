Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-3566:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `tty` demuxer in FFmpeg was missing a `read_probe` function. This function is responsible for inspecting the input file to determine if it matches the demuxer's expected format.

**Weakness:**
The absence of `read_probe` means the `tty` demuxer could be triggered by an input file that it was not intended to handle.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
When a crafted `ffconcat` file references an image file and then a second file that triggers the `tty` demuxer, the contents of the second file are copied verbatim into the output file, provided the `-vcodec copy` option is used. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary content into the output stream.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves crafting a malicious input file that:
  1. Starts with a valid "ffconcat" file structure, which is used by FFmpeg to concatenate media files.
  2. References an image file.
  3. References a file that can trigger the `tty` demuxer (due to the missing read\_probe function).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted input file to ffmpeg.
* The attacker needs to know that the target is using ffmpeg with the `-vcodec copy` option, or otherwise entice the user to use this option when processing the crafted file.
* The attacker needs to create a file that triggers the tty demuxer, for example, a file with a matching file extension that is processed by the `tty_extensions` variable of the tty demuxer.

**Additional Notes:**
The commit `3bce9e9` introduces the missing `read_probe` function, which is designed to verify that the input matches the expected `tty` format before the `tty` demuxer is triggered. This commit contains the fix for CVE-2021-3566.

In summary, the vulnerability allows for the injection of arbitrary content into the output file by exploiting a missing check in the `tty` demuxer.
