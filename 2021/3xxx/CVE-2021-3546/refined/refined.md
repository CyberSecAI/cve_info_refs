Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-3546:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds write in the `virgl_cmd_get_capset` function within the vhost-user-gpu component of QEMU.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `virgl_cmd_get_capset` function retrieves capability set information. If the `max_size` returned by `virgl_renderer_get_cap_set` is zero, the function would allocate memory using `g_malloc0` with size `sizeof(*resp)` which doesn't include space for the capset data. Subsequently,  `virgl_renderer_fill_caps` attempts to write data after this allocated buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious guest user can trigger this out-of-bounds write by sending a `VIRTIO_GPU_CMD_GET_CAPSET` command that results in a `max_size` of zero. This can lead to:
    - Crashing the QEMU process on the host, causing a denial-of-service (DoS).
    - Potential arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through a command sent by a guest operating system to the QEMU hypervisor via the virtio vhost-user GPU device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have control over a guest operating system running within a QEMU virtual machine.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to send commands to the virtualized GPU device. This implies the attacker has some privileges within the guest.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves checking the returned `max_size`. If `max_size` is zero, the function will return an error (`VIRTIO_GPU_RESP_ERR_INVALID_PARAMETER`) instead of allocating a buffer and writing to memory out of bounds.
- The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2016-10028 which affected virtio-gpu-3d, where an out-of-bounds access could occur while reading virgl capabilities.
- This vulnerability is considered high severity, specifically with a CVSS score of 8.8 according to the NetApp advisory.
- The issue is present in QEMU versions prior to 7.0.0.
- Red Hat states that RHEL 6, 7 and 8 are not affected as Virgl was not enabled in those versions. It was enabled as a technical preview in RHEL Advanced Virtualization 8.2, and later disabled in RHEL Advanced Virtualization 8.3.
