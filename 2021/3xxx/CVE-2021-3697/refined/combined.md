| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1991687#c0)  Marco Benatto    2021-08-09 17:24:46 UTC  ``` A crafted JPEG image may lead the JPEG reader to underflow its data pointer, allowing user controlled data to be written in heap. To a successful to be performed the attacker needs to perform some triage over the heap layout and craft an image with a malicious format and payload. This vulnerability can lead to data corruption and eventual code execution or secure boot circumvention.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1991687#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-06-16 13:51:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.1 Update Services for SAP Solutions  Via RHSA-2022:5098 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:5098](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A5098)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1991687#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-06-16 14:55:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2022:5096 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:5096](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A5096)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1991687#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-06-16 15:23:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2022:5099 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:5099](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A5099)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1991687#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-06-16 15:33:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2022:5095 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:5095](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A5095)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1991687#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-06-16 15:45:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2022:5100 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:5100](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A5100)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1991687#c9)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-06-16 21:07:59 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
