Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-3474:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from an undefined shift operation within the `Imf_2_5::FastHufDecoder::FastHufDecoder` function in OpenEXR. Specifically, a calculation involving bit shifting is performed using a 32-bit integer, which can lead to an integer overflow when the shift amount is large causing a shift overflow. This is due to the use of `(2 << (\_maxCodeLength-l))` instead of `(2ll << (\_maxCodeLength-l))`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Undefined Shift Operation:** The core issue is the undefined behavior resulting from an integer overflow during a bit shift operation.
*   **Integer Overflow:** A large value is calculated, leading to an integer overflow, resulting in undefined behavior and unpredictable outcomes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service due to an application crash. This is because the incorrect calculation can result in invalid memory access.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malformed Image File:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted or malformed OpenEXR image file.
*   **File Processing:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious OpenEXR image to be processed by a vulnerable application using the OpenEXR library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker must be able to supply the vulnerable application with a specially crafted OpenEXR file.
*   **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not need special privileges to exploit this vulnerability as it's triggered by normal file processing functions.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in OpenEXR versions 2.5.4, 2.5.5, and 3.0.1 and later versions.
*   The fix involves ensuring the calculation for code length uses a 64-bit integer to prevent the shift overflow by using `(2ll << (\_maxCodeLength-l))` instead of `(2 << (\_maxCodeLength-l))`.

**Summary of Relevant Content:**

The content provides details about a vulnerability in OpenEXR related to an undefined shift operation that could lead to a denial of service. The vulnerability is triggered when processing a malformed image file. A patch was implemented by changing the bit shift operation to utilize 64-bit integers rather than 32-bit integers, thus preventing overflows. The provided information is more detailed than the basic CVE description, providing the root cause, attack vectors, and impact.
