Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3882:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The LedgerSMB application does not set the 'Secure' attribute on the session authorization cookie when the client uses HTTPS and the LedgerSMB server is behind a reverse proxy. This means the cookie can be transmitted over unencrypted HTTP connections.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing 'Secure' attribute on session cookie:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of the 'Secure' attribute on the session cookie. This attribute is crucial for ensuring that cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS, preventing them from being intercepted over HTTP connections.
*   **Reliance on SERVER_PROTOCOL:** The application was initially checking the `SERVER_PROTOCOL` environment variable to determine if the connection was HTTPS. However, this variable is not reliably set by reverse proxies which changes the `HTTPS` variable based on the `X-Forwarded-*` headers instead of `SERVER_PROTOCOL`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can potentially intercept the session cookie if a user is tricked into using an unencrypted HTTP connection. Once the attacker has the cookie, they can access the application as the compromised user.
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the user's account, allowing them to view and potentially manipulate sensitive data within the LedgerSMB application.
*   **Limited Integrity Impact:** The advisory notes that proper audit control and separation of duties limit the integrity impact.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack:** An attacker needs to be positioned to eavesdrop on network traffic between the client and the server.
*   **User manipulation:** The attacker must trick a user into using an unencrypted HTTP connection instead of HTTPS. This could involve techniques like redirecting the user to an HTTP page or using a manipulated link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the server.
*   **Ability to induce HTTP connection:** The attacker must be able to convince the user to connect to the server using HTTP instead of HTTPS. This requires some form of social engineering or network manipulation.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects LedgerSMB versions 1.8.0 up to and including 1.8.21.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.8.22.
*   A patch has been released which addresses this by using the `HTTPS` variable instead of `SERVER_PROTOCOL` to set the Secure attribute.
*   Workarounds include configuring the reverse proxy (Apache or Nginx) to add the "Secure" attribute to the session cookie at the network boundary instead of relying on the application itself.
