The provided content details two distinct crashes found in ActivePresenter version 6.1.6 (x86) through fuzzing, specifically:

**Crash #01 - Write Access Violation**

*   **Root Cause:** A write access violation occurs when the program attempts to write to an invalid memory location. The specific instruction `add dword ptr [esi],eax` at address `018ff515` attempts to write to the memory pointed by `esi` which is `3a002200`. This address appears to be invalid, leading to the access violation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The software has a vulnerability related to memory access, where the program does not properly validate the memory address before attempting a write operation.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** The immediate impact is a crash of the application. The 'exploitable' classification suggests the possibility of further exploitation which could lead to more severe consequences, such as arbitrary code execution but this is not fully demonstrated by the provided information.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted `.approj` file. The fuzzer is used to generate such inputs that trigger the crashes.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed `.approj` file to the ActivePresenter application.

**Crash #02 - Write Access Violation**

*   **Root Cause:** This crash also stems from a write access violation. The `lock btr dword ptr [eax],0` instruction at address `775a6b90` (within ntdll.dll) attempts to write to the address stored in `eax`, which is `0x4d0024`. This address is likely invalid, or not owned by the process, leading to the access violation. The crash occurs within a critical section function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Similar to the first crash, this vulnerability lies in improper memory access handling within a critical section, where the program doesn't validate the memory address before attempting a bit test and reset operation.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Similar to the first crash, the immediate impact is a crash of the application, with a possibility of further exploitation.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted `.approj` file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  An attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed `.approj` file to the ActivePresenter application.
