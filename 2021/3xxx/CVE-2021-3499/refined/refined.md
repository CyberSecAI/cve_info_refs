{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Egress Firewall in OVN-Kubernetes does not reliably apply firewall rules when there are multiple DNS rules.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A deadlock can occur when adding EgressFirewalls with 5 or more dnsNames, leading to inconsistent firewall rules being applied.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Potential loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a service due to firewall rules not being applied as expected.",
  "Attack vectors": "Adding EgressFirewalls with multiple DNS rules.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need the ability to create or modify EgressFirewall rules within the OVN-Kubernetes environment."
