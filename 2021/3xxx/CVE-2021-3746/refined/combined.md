tpm2: NVMarshal: Handle index orderly RAM without 0-sized terminating…

… node

The NVRAM entries in s_indexOrderlyRam array do not need to contain a
0-sized terminating node. Instead, the entries may fill up this 512
byte array so that no NV_RAM_HEADER structure fits anymore. The fact
that no more NV_RAM_HEADER structure fits is also an indicator for the
last entry. We need to account for this in the code marshalling and
unmarshalling the entries so that we stop marshalling the entries
then and similarly stop unmarshalling.

tpm2: Initialize a whole OBJECT before using it

```
Initialize a whole OBJECT before using it. This is necessary since
an OBJECT may also be used as a HASH_OBJECT via the ANY_OBJECT
union and that HASH_OBJECT can leave bad size inidicators in TPM2B
buffer in the OBJECT. To get rid of this problem we reset the whole
OBJECT to 0 before using it. This is as if the memory for the
OBJECT was just initialized.
