Date: Sun, 28 Mar 2021 18:35:29 +0000
From: Mark J Cox <mark@...nssl.org>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: Re: OpenSSL 1.1.1 CVE-2021-3450 CA certificate check
 bypass with X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT, CVE-2021-3449 NULL pointer deref in
 signature_algorithms processing

The usual process for OpenSSL pre-notifications (as per our security policy
at <https://www.openssl.org/policies/secpolicy.html> ) is to give a heads up
message to the private distros list and ask vendors who want details to
reconfirm they will abide by the embargo guidelines.  For those that do, we
then add to a private github fork where they can view the advisory and
patches and also comment (since the comments and testing from such
packagers are very valuable in making sure we get the right fix the first
time).

However this time we faced a little bit of a time crunch, we want to get
fixes for High issues out as soon as we can, but with the Easter public
holidays looming for several of our team, and some already pre-planned
OpenSSL team holidays, we decided to give less than our usual one-full-week
prenotification.  Usually that process of waiting for responses takes an
extra trip around the sun due to timezones, so I decided to skip it and
added all the same folks who had access to the last issue to this issue,
and the mail to distros@ asked the members to let me know if I needed to
make any add/remove changes to that list.  Those who accessed the link were
reminded of the embargo and guidelines in a few places.

We were alerted to the Wind River security advisory being public by a
vendor after they saw a tweet about it.  The page stated there were two
issues, gave the CVE names for the two issues, and gave the one line
description of each issue.  It also, as you stated, listed the commit
hashes and the URL to the private github advisory and fork.  However those
commits and the URLs were part of the private github branch therefore
protected and only accessible to the specific github ids for the vendors
we'd added.

At that point we were only 24 hours away from the scheduled release date,
and the extra details on the page were not sufficient for us to call the
embargo broken nor to bring forward the release date.  We did however ask
Wind River to remove the page and provide an explanation, which they did.
We continued to monitor to see if the CVE names were being discussed in
case we had to change the plan.  The final publication and hence end of the
embargo happened to the planned schedule.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-1971

The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those
name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which
compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function
behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer
dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses
the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names
between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certiﬁcate 2) When
verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via
the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control
both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can
trick a client or server into checking a malicious certiﬁcate against a malicious CRL then this may occur.
Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certiﬁcate.
This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certiﬁcate and CRL being veriﬁed. OpenSSL’s
s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the “-crl_download” option which implements
automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note
that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct
encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that
OpenSSL’s parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are
affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed
in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).

node::TLSWrap::DoWrite with a freshly allocated WriteWrap object as ﬁrst argument. If the DoWrite
method does not return an error, this object is passed back to the caller as part of a StreamWriteResult

Request Smuggling’)

Vulnerability CVE-2020-8625

BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are conﬁgured to use GSS-
TSIG features. In a conﬁguration which uses BIND’s default settings the vulnerable code path is
not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting valid values for the tkey-
gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credentialconﬁguration options. Although the default conﬁguration is not
vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well
as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers.
The most likely outcome of a successful exploitation of the vulnerability is a crash of the named
process. However, remote code execution, while unproven, is theoretically possible. Affects: BIND
9.5.0 -> 9.11.27, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.11, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.27-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 ->

An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello message
from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature_algorithms extension (where
it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension then a
NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack. A server is only
vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which is the default conﬁguration). OpenSSL
TLS clients are not impacted by this issue. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions are affected by this issue.
Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this

Vulnerability CVE-2021-3450

The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT ﬂag enables additional security checks of the certiﬁcates present
in a certiﬁcate chain.
It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to
disallow certiﬁcates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added
as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a
previous check to conﬁrm that certiﬁcates in the chain are valid CA certiﬁcates was overwritten. This
effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certiﬁcates must not be able to issue other certiﬁcates. If a
“purpose” has been conﬁgured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certiﬁcate is
a valid CA. All of the named “purpose” values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore,
where a purpose is set the certiﬁcate chain will still be rejected even when the strict ﬂag has been
used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certiﬁcate veriﬁcation routines, but it can
be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly
set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT veriﬁcation ﬂag and either not set a purpose for the certiﬁcate
veriﬁcation or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL
versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to
OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected

Vulnerability CVE-2021-3711

In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function
EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The ﬁrst time, on en-
try, the “out” parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the “outlen” parameter is populated with the buffer
size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufﬁciently sized
buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the “out”
parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of
the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the ﬁrst call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can
be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overﬂow when
EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A
malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause
attacker chosen data to overﬂow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of
other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application
to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in

Vulnerability CVE-2021-3712

ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which
contains a buffer holding the string data and a ﬁeld holding the buffer length. This contrasts with
normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL
(0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL’s own “d2i”
functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the
ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING
structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures
which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the “data” and “length” ﬁelds in the
ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous
OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING
byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been
directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where
that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application
without NUL terminating the “data” ﬁeld, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can
also occur during name constraints processing of certiﬁcates (for example if a certiﬁcate has been
directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and
the certiﬁcate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures).
It can also occur in the
X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor
can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of
the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing
a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such
as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in
OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y).

that such a malicious HTTPS proxy needs to provide a certiﬁcate that curl will accept for the MITMed

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22901

curl 7.75.0 through 7.76.1 suffers from a use-after-free vulnerability resulting in already freed memory
being used when a TLS 1.3 session ticket arrives over a connection. A malicious server can use
this in rare unfortunate circumstances to potentially reach remote code execution in the client. When
libcurl at run-time sets up support for TLS 1.3 session tickets on a connection using OpenSSL, it
stores pointers to the transfer in-memory object for later retrieval when a session ticket arrives. If
the connection is used by multiple transfers (like with a reused HTTP/1.1 connection or multiplexed
HTTP/2 connection) that ﬁrst transfer object might be freed before the new session is established on
that connection and then the function will access a memory buffer that might be freed. When using
that memory, libcurl might even call a function pointer in the object, making it possible for a remote
code execution if the server could somehow manage to get crafted memory content into the correct
place in memory.

Calls to EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_EncryptUpdate and EVP_DecryptUpdate may overﬂow the output
length argument in some cases where the input length is close to the maximum permissable length for
an integer on the platform. In such cases the return value from the function call will be 1 (indicating
success), but the output length value will be negative. This could cause applications to behave
incorrectly or crash. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these
versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this
issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium
support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j.
Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).

-> 9.16.13-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition, as well as release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.1 of
the BIND 9.17 development branch, BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected
version and are conﬁgured to use GSS-TSIG features. In a conﬁguration which uses BIND’s default
settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly
setting values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential conﬁguration options. Although
the default conﬁguration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND
is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with
Active Directory domain controllers. For servers that meet these conditions, the ISC SPNEGO
implementation is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on the CPU architecture for which BIND
was built: For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platforms, this ﬂaw can be used to trigger a buffer
over-read, leading to a server crash. For named binaries compiled for 32-bit platforms, this ﬂaw can
be used to trigger a server crash due to a buffer overﬂow and possibly also to achieve remote code
execution. We have determined that standard SPNEGO implementations are available in the MIT and
Heimdal Kerberos libraries, which support a broad range of operating systems, rendering the ISC
implementation unnecessary and obsolete. Therefore, to reduce the attack surface for BIND users,
we will be removing the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND 9.11 and 9.16 (it
had already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally remove something from a stable
ESV (Extended Support Version) of BIND, but since system libraries can replace the ISC SPNEGO
implementation, we have made an exception in this case for reasons of stability and security.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-32803

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary
File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufﬁcient symlink protection. node-tar aims to guarantee
that any ﬁle whose location would be modiﬁed by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part,
achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent
unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when
directories are created. This logic was insufﬁcient when extracting tar ﬁles that contained both a
directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the
directory being created and added to the node-tar directory cache. When a directory is present in the
directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where
node-tar checks for symlinks occur. By ﬁrst creating a directory, and then replacing that directory
with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially
allowing an untrusted tar ﬁle to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary
ﬁles into that location, thus allowing arbitrary ﬁle creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in
releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-32804

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.1, 5.0.6, 4.4.14, and 3.3.2 has a arbitrary File
Creation/Overwrite vulnerability due to insufﬁcient absolute path sanitization. node-tar aims to prevent
extraction of absolute ﬁle paths by turning absolute paths into relative paths when the preservePaths
ﬂag is not set to true. This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute ﬁle paths
contained in a tar ﬁle. For example /home/user/.bashrc would turn into home/user/.bashrc. This
logic was insufﬁcient when ﬁle paths contained repeated path roots such as ////home/user/.bashrc.
node-tar would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute ﬁle path with
repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. ///home/user/.bashrc) would still resolve to an absolute
path, thus allowing arbitrary ﬁle creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2,
4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a
custom onentry method which sanitizes the entry.path or a filter method which removes entries
with absolute paths. See referenced GitHub Advisory for details. Be aware of CVE-2021-32803 which
ﬁxes a similar bug in later versions of tar.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37701

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.16, 5.0.8, and 6.1.7 has an arbitrary ﬁle
creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any ﬁle
whose location would be modiﬁed by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by
ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary
stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are
created. This logic was insufﬁcient when extracting tar ﬁles that contained both a directory and a
symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive
entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both
\ and / characters as path separators, however \ is a valid ﬁlename character on posix systems.
By ﬁrst creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to
bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar ﬁle to symlink
into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary ﬁles into that location, thus allowing
arbitrary ﬁle creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive
ﬁlesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at FOO, followed by a symbolic link named foo, then
on case-insensitive ﬁle systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from
the ﬁlesystem, but not from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit.
A subsequent ﬁle entry within the FOO directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic
link, thinking that the directory had already been created. These issues were addressed in releases
4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches
for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version
of node-tar. If this is not possible, a workaround is available in the referenced GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37712

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary ﬁle
creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any ﬁle
whose location would be modiﬁed by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by
ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary
stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are
created. This logic was insufﬁcient when extracting tar ﬁles that contained both a directory and a
symlink with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on
Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same ﬁle system entities as their 8.3 “short
path” counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include a directory with one form of the
path, followed by a symbolic link with a different string that resolves to the same ﬁle system entity,
followed by a ﬁle using the ﬁrst form. By ﬁrst creating a directory, and then replacing that directory
with a symlink that had a different apparent name that resolved to the same entry in the ﬁlesystem, it
was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted
tar ﬁle to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary ﬁles into that location,
thus allowing arbitrary ﬁle creation and overwrite. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18,
5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for
these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37713

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary ﬁle
creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any ﬁle
whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. This is, in part,
accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that
contain .. path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This
logic was insufﬁcient on Windows systems when extracting tar ﬁles that contained a path that was not
an absolute path, but speciﬁed a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as C:some\path.
If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example D:\extraction\dir, then the result
of path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath) would resolve against the current working
directory on the C: drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a .. portion of the
path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as C:../foo, and was not properly sanitized
by the logic that checked for .. within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects
users of node-tar on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and
6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues.
If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar.
There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization
procedures that node-tar now does. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions
of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-39134

@npmcli/arborist, the library that calculates dependency trees and manages the node_modules
folder hierarchy for the npm command line interface, aims to guarantee that package dependency con-
tracts will be met, and the extraction of package contents will always be performed into the expected
folder. This is, in part, accomplished by resolving dependency speciﬁers deﬁned in package.json man-
ifests for dependencies with a speciﬁc name, and nesting folders to resolve conﬂicting dependencies.
When multiple dependencies differ only in the case of their name, Arborist’s internal data structure saw
them as separate items that could coexist within the same level in the node_modules hierarchy. How-
ever, on case-insensitive ﬁle systems (such as macOS and Windows), this is not the case. Combined
with a symlink dependency such as file:/some/path, this allowed an attacker to create a situation in
which arbitrary contents could be written to any location on the ﬁlesystem. For example, a package
pwn-a could deﬁne a dependency in their package.json ﬁle such as "foo": "file:/some/path". An-
other package, pwn-b could deﬁne a dependency such as FOO: "file:foo.tgz". On case-insensitive
ﬁle systems, if pwn-a was installed, and then pwn-b was installed afterwards, the contents of foo.tgz
would be written to /some/path, and any existing contents of /some/path would be removed. Anyone
using npm v7.20.6 or earlier on a case-insensitive ﬁlesystem is potentially affected. This is patched in
@npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-39135

@npmcli/arborist, the library that calculates dependency trees and manages the node_modules
folder hierarchy for the npm command line interface, aims to guarantee that package dependency
contracts will be met, and the extraction of package contents will always be performed into the
expected folder. This is accomplished by extracting package contents into a project’s node_modules
folder. If the node_modules folder of the root project or any of its dependencies is somehow replaced
with a symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies to any arbitrary location on
the ﬁle system. Note that symbolic links contained within package artifact contents are ﬁltered out, so
another means of creating a node_modules symbolic link would have to be employed. 1. A preinstall
script could replace node_modules with a symlink. (This is prevented by using --ignore-scripts.)
2. An attacker could supply the target with a git repository, instructing them to run npm install
--ignore-scripts in the root. This may be successful, because npm install --ignore-scripts is
typically not capable of making changes outside of the project directory, so it may be deemed safe.
This is patched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above. For more
information including workarounds please see the referenced GHSA-gmw6-94gg-2rc2.

Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted
explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads
or writes.

Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or
even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols
involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we’re aware of, either only “named
curves” are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they
specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can’t represent
problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable
application is low.

In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates,
so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509
certificates. Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an “exotic”
curve encoding.

The affected APIs include: EC\_GROUP\_new\_curve\_GF2m(), EC\_GROUP\_new\_from\_params(),
and various supporting BN\_GF2m\_\*() functions.

Applications working with “exotic” explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters,
that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero
constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a
result of reading or writing outside of array bounds. Remote code execution
cannot easily be ruled out.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS
clients checking server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory
address resulting in abnormal termination of the application process.

Impact summary: Abnormal termination of an application can a cause a denial of
service.

Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS clients checking
server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory address when
comparing the expected name with an `otherName` subject alternative name of an
X.509 certificate. This may result in an exception that terminates the
application program.

Note that basic certificate chain validation (signatures, dates, …) is not
affected, the denial of service can occur only when the application also
specifies an expected DNS name, Email address or IP address.

TLS servers rarely solicit client certificates, and even when they do, they
generally don’t perform a name check against a reference identifier (expected
identity), but rather extract the presented identity after checking the
certificate chain. So TLS servers are generally not affected and the severity
of the issue is Moderate.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL\_select\_next\_proto with an
empty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to
be sent to the peer.

Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences
such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue
could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent
to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications
that directly call the SSL\_select\_next\_proto function with a 0 length list of
supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never
be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by
accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling
application.

The OpenSSL API function SSL\_select\_next\_proto is typically used by TLS
applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN
(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and
is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more
widely deployed than NPN. The SSL\_select\_next\_proto function accepts a list of
protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns
the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the
client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the
first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap
between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL\_select\_next\_proto is
called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and
returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports
that there was no overlap in the lists).

This function is typically called from a server side application callback for
ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list
of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in
length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never
normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the
SSL\_select\_next\_proto function has been called as expected (with the list
supplied by the client passed in the client/client\_len parameters), then the
application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has
accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has
accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client\_len
parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a “no overlap”
response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it
will be vulnerable to this problem.

In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select
a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol
in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes
from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.
However if the SSL\_select\_next\_proto function is accidentally called with a
client\_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the
application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of
confidentiality will occur.

This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most
likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not
widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.
Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active
exploitation unlikely.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of
OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they
become available.

Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL\_free\_buffers may cause
memory to be accessed that was previously freed in some situations

Impact summary: A use after free can have a range of potential consequences such
as the corruption of valid data, crashes or execution of arbitrary code.
However, only applications that directly call the SSL\_free\_buffers function are
affected by this issue. Applications that do not call this function are not
vulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by
applications.

The SSL\_free\_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used
when processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected
to succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have
been identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.

The first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the
network and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived.
In this case calling SSL\_free\_buffers will succeed even though a record has only
been partially processed and the buffer is still in use.

The second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has
been received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of
this data. Again a call to SSL\_free\_buffers will succeed even though the buffer
is still in use.

While these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a
malicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.
We are not aware of this issue being actively exploited.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may be very
slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check()
or EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() to check a DSA public key or DSA parameters may
experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked
have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of
Service.

The functions EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check() or EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() perform
various checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long time
if the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large.

Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not allow using
public keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for signature
verification. However the key and parameter check functions do not limit
the modulus size when performing the checks.

An application that calls EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check() or EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check()
and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be
vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

These functions are not called by OpenSSL itself on untrusted DSA keys so
only applications that directly call these functions may be vulnerable.

Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applications
when using the `-check` option.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Some non-default TLS server configurations can cause unbounded
memory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessions

Impact summary: An attacker may exploit certain server configurations to trigger
unbounded memory growth that would lead to a Denial of Service

This problem can occur in TLSv1.3 if the non-default SSL\_OP\_NO\_TICKET option is
being used (but not if early\_data support is also configured and the default
anti-replay protection is in use). In this case, under certain conditions, the
session cache can get into an incorrect state and it will fail to flush properly
as it fills. The session cache will continue to grow in an unbounded manner. A
malicious client could deliberately create the scenario for this failure to
force a Denial of Service. It may also happen by accident in normal operation.

This issue only affects TLS servers supporting TLSv1.3. It does not affect TLS
clients.

The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue. OpenSSL
1.0.2 is also not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL
to crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack

Impact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted
sources might terminate abruptly.

A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an
untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but
OpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer
dereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12
files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will
be vulnerable to this issue.

OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12\_parse(),
PKCS12\_unpack\_p7data(), PKCS12\_unpack\_p7encdata(), PKCS12\_unpack\_authsafes()
and PKCS12\_newpass().

We have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME\_write\_PKCS7(). However since this
function is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.

The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Checking excessively long invalid RSA public keys may take
a long time.

Impact summary: Applications that use the function EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check()
to check RSA public keys may experience long delays. Where the key that
is being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead
to a Denial of Service.

When function EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() is called on RSA public keys,
a computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite.
For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and this
computation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime,
then this computation would take a long time.

An application that calls EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() and supplies an RSA key
obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service
attack.

The function EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() is not called from other OpenSSL
functions however it is called from the OpenSSL pkey command line
application. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used
with the ‘-pubin’ and ‘-check’ options on untrusted data.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.

Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation
contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications running
on PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides vector instructions.

Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC
algorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with various
application dependent consequences.

The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL for
PowerPC CPUs restores the contents of vector registers in a different order
than they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these vector registers
are corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only
on newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.

The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can
be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not
depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst
consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application
process. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing
pointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result
of some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of
service.

The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the
CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)
algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol
versions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious
client can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies that
TLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However
we are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected
by this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.

Issue summary: Generating excessively long X9.42 DH keys or checking
excessively long X9.42 DH keys or parameters may be very slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH\_generate\_key() to
generate an X9.42 DH key may experience long delays. Likewise, applications
that use DH\_check\_pub\_key(), DH\_check\_pub\_key\_ex() or EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check()
to check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays.
Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from
an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.

While DH\_check() performs all the necessary checks (as of CVE-2023-3817),
DH\_check\_pub\_key() doesn’t make any of these checks, and is therefore
vulnerable for excessively large P and Q parameters.

Likewise, while DH\_generate\_key() performs a check for an excessively large
P, it doesn’t check for an excessively large Q.

An application that calls DH\_generate\_key() or DH\_check\_pub\_key() and
supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be

Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the processing of key and
initialisation vector (IV) lengths. This can lead to potential truncation
or overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.

Impact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,
which could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.

When calling EVP\_EncryptInit\_ex2(), EVP\_DecryptInit\_ex2() or
EVP\_CipherInit\_ex2() the provided OSSL\_PARAM array is processed after
the key and IV have been established. Any alterations to the key length,
via the “keylen” parameter or the IV length, via the “ivlen” parameter,
within the OSSL\_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially
causing truncation or overreading of these values. The following ciphers
and cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.

For the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in
loss of confidentiality. For example, when following NIST’s SP 800-38D
section 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in
GCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.

Both truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will
produce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory
exception. However, these issues are not currently assessed as security
critical.

Changing the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation
and the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that
application developers will have spotted this problem during testing since
decryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly
vulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being
vulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then
this issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed this
issue as Moderate severity overall.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this because
the issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary.

OpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.

Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation
contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications on the
Windows 64 platform when running on newer X86\_64 processors supporting the
AVX512-IFMA instructions.

Impact summary: If in an application that uses the OpenSSL library an attacker
can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the application
state might be corrupted with various application dependent consequences.

The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL does
not save the contents of non-volatile XMM registers on Windows 64 platform
when calculating the MAC of data larger than 64 bytes. Before returning to
the caller all the XMM registers are set to zero rather than restoring their
previous content. The vulnerable code is used only on newer x86\_64 processors
supporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions.

The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can
be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not
depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst
consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application
process. However given the contents of the registers are just zeroized so
the attacker cannot put arbitrary values inside, the most likely consequence,
if any, would be an incorrect result of some application dependent
calculations or a crash leading to a denial of service.

The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the
CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)
algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol
versions 1.2 and 1.3 and a malicious client can influence whether this AEAD
cipher is used by the server. This implies that server applications using
OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However we are currently not aware of
any concrete application that would be affected by this issue therefore we
consider this a Low severity security issue.

As a workaround the AVX512-IFMA instructions support can be disabled at
runtime by setting the environment variable OPENSSL\_ia32cap:

OPENSSL\_ia32cap=:~0x200000

The FIPS provider is not affected by this issue.

Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH\_check(), DH\_check\_ex()
or EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long
delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained
from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.

The function DH\_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing
CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger
an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value,
if present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is
unnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.

An application that calls DH\_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained
from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

The function DH\_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.
An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.
The other functions affected by this are DH\_check\_ex() and
EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check().

Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications
when using the “-check” option.

Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH\_check(), DH\_check\_ex()
or EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long
delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained
from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.

The function DH\_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those
checks confirms that the modulus (‘p’ parameter) is not too large. Trying to use
a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which
is over 10,000 bits in length.

However the DH\_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters
that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value
even if it has already been found to be too large.

An application that calls DH\_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained
from an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack.

The function DH\_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.

Issue summary: The AES-SIV cipher implementation contains a bug that causes
it to ignore empty associated data entries which are unauthenticated as
a consequence.

Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-SIV algorithm and want to
authenticate empty data entries as associated data can be misled by removing,
adding or reordering such empty entries as these are ignored by the OpenSSL
implementation. We are currently unaware of any such applications.

The AES-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multiple associated
data entries along with the encryption. To authenticate empty data the
application has to call EVP\_EncryptUpdate() (or EVP\_CipherUpdate()) with
NULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input buffer length.
The AES-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for such a call
instead of performing the associated data authentication operation.
The empty data thus will not be authenticated.

As this issue does not affect non-empty associated data authentication and
we expect it to be rare for an application to use empty associated data
entries this is qualified as Low severity issue.

Issue summary: Processing some specially crafted ASN.1 object identifiers or
data containing them may be very slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use OBJ\_obj2txt() directly, or use any of
the OpenSSL subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no message
size limit may experience notable to very long delays when processing those
messages, which may lead to a Denial of Service.

An OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers -
most of which have no size limit. OBJ\_obj2txt() may be used to translate
an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL
type ASN1\_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the
sub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by
periods.

When one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large
(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds
of KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long
time. The time complexity is O(n^2) with ’n’ being the size of the
sub-identifiers in bytes (\*).

With OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /
identifiers in string form was introduced. This includes using OBJECT
IDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching
algorithms.

Such OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure
AlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify
what cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or
decrypt, or digest passed data.

Applications that call OBJ\_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are
affected, with any version of OpenSSL. If the use is for the mere purpose
of display, the severity is considered low.

In OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,
CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS. It also impacts anything that processes X.509
certificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.

The impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a
100KiB limit on the peer’s certificate chain. Additionally, this only
impacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client
authentication.

In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,
such as X.509 certificates. This is assumed to not happen in such a way
that it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered
not affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,
and the severity is therefore considered low.

Issue summary: The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM
platform contains a bug that could cause it to read past the input buffer,
leading to a crash.

Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-XTS algorithm on the 64 bit ARM
platform can crash in rare circumstances. The AES-XTS algorithm is usually
used for disk encryption.

The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform will read
past the end of the ciphertext buffer if the ciphertext size is 4 mod 5 in 16
byte blocks, e.g. 144 bytes or 1024 bytes. If the memory after the ciphertext
buffer is unmapped, this will trigger a crash which results in a denial of
service.

If an attacker can control the size and location of the ciphertext buffer
being decrypted by an application using AES-XTS on 64 bit ARM, the
application is affected. This is fairly unlikely making this issue
a Low severity one.

The function X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_add0\_policy() is documented to
implicitly enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate
verification. However the implementation of the function does not
enable the check which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect
policies to pass the certificate verification.

As suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments it was
decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_add0\_policy()
function.

Instead the applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate
policy check need to use X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_set1\_policies() or explicitly
enable the policy check by calling X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_set\_flags() with
the X509\_V\_FLAG\_POLICY\_CHECK flag argument.

Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are not
commonly used by applications.

Applications that use a non-default option when verifying certificates may be
vulnerable to an attack from a malicious CA to circumvent certain checks.

Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are silently ignored by
OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks are skipped for that certificate.
A malicious CA could use this to deliberately assert invalid certificate policies
in order to circumvent policy checking on the certificate altogether.

Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing
the `-policy` argument to the command line utilities or by calling the
`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()` function.

A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being
verified on PKCS7 signed or signedAndEnveloped data. In case the hash
algorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library but
the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available the digest
initialization will fail. There is a missing check for the return
value from the initialization function which later leads to invalid
usage of the digest API most likely leading to a crash.

The unavailability of an algorithm can be caused by using FIPS
enabled configuration of providers or more commonly by not loading
the legacy provider.

PKCS7 data is processed by the SMIME library calls and also by the
time stamp (TS) library calls. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does
not call these functions however third party applications would be
affected if they call these functions to verify signatures on untrusted
data.

There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing
inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1\_STRING but
the public structure definition for GENERAL\_NAME incorrectly specified the type
of the x400Address field as ASN1\_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by
the OpenSSL function GENERAL\_NAME\_cmp as an ASN1\_TYPE rather than an
ASN1\_STRING.

When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the
X509\_V\_FLAG\_CRL\_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass
arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or
enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to
provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a
valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other
input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which
is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect
applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs
over a network.

An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an
application tries to check a malformed DSA public key by the
EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() function. This will most likely lead
to an application crash. This function can be called on public
keys supplied from untrusted sources which could allow an attacker
to cause a denial of service attack.

The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function
but applications might call the function if there are additional
security requirements imposed by standards such as FIPS 140-3.

The public API function BIO\_new\_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming
ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the
SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by
end user applications.

The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO\_f\_asn1 filter
BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of
the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS
recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function
returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain
is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains
internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on
to call BIO\_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most
likely result in a crash.

This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64\_write\_ASN1() which
may cause BIO\_new\_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO\_pop() on
the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions
PEM\_write\_bio\_ASN1\_stream, PEM\_write\_bio\_CMS\_stream, PEM\_write\_bio\_PKCS7\_stream,
SMIME\_write\_ASN1, SMIME\_write\_CMS and SMIME\_write\_PKCS7.

Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include
i2d\_ASN1\_bio\_stream, BIO\_new\_CMS, BIO\_new\_PKCS7, i2d\_CMS\_bio\_stream and
i2d\_PKCS7\_bio\_stream.

The OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.

The function PEM\_read\_bio\_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and
decodes the “name” (e.g. “CERTIFICATE”), any header data and the payload data.
If the function succeeds then the “name\_out”, “header” and “data” arguments are
populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The
caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a
PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM\_read\_bio\_ex()
will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer
to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer
then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This
could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM
files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack.

The functions PEM\_read\_bio() and PEM\_read() are simple wrappers around
PEM\_read\_bio\_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected.

These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL
functions including PEM\_X509\_INFO\_read\_bio\_ex() and
SSL\_CTX\_use\_serverinfo\_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal
uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the
header argument if PEM\_read\_bio\_ex() returns a failure code. These locations
include the PEM\_read\_bio\_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in
OpenSSL 3.0.

The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.

A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation
which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a
Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attacker
would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for
decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,
RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.

For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an
encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a
genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send
trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a
sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master
secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the
application data sent over that connection.

A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,
specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs
after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a
CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to
continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path
to a trusted issuer.

The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to
a denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in the disclosure
of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext)
although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory
contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory.

In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious
server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests
client authentication and a malicious client connects.

If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and
policy processing is enabled, then a write lock will be taken twice
recursively. On some operating systems (most widely: Windows) this
results in a denial of service when the affected process hangs. Policy
processing being enabled on a publicly facing server is not considered
to be a common setup.

Policy processing is enabled by passing the `-policy`
argument to the command line utilities or by calling the
`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()` function.

A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described above have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade to a new version as soon as possible. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.

OpenSSL supports creating a custom cipher via the legacy EVP\_CIPHER\_meth\_new() function and associated function calls. This function was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0 and application authors are instead encouraged to use the new provider mechanism in order to implement custom ciphers. OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 incorrectly handle legacy custom ciphers passed to the EVP\_EncryptInit\_ex2(), EVP\_DecryptInit\_ex2() and EVP\_CipherInit\_ex2() functions (as well as other similarly named encryption and decryption initialisation functions). Instead of using the custom cipher directly it incorrectly tries to fetch an equivalent cipher from the available providers. An equivalent cipher is found based on the NID passed to EVP\_CIPHER\_meth\_new(). This NID is supposed to represent the unique NID for a given cipher. However it is possible for an application to incorrectly pass NID\_undef as this value in the call to EVP\_CIPHER\_meth\_new(). When NID\_undef is used in this way the OpenSSL encryption/decryption initialisation function will match the NULL cipher as being equivalent and will fetch this from the available providers. This will succeed if the default provider has been loaded (or if a third party provider has been loaded that offers this cipher). Using the NULL cipher means that the plaintext is emitted as the ciphertext. Applications are only affected by this issue if they call EVP\_CIPHER\_meth\_new() using NID\_undef and subsequently use it in a call to an encryption/decryption initialisation function. Applications that only use SSL/TLS are not impacted by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0.4 release introduced a serious bug in the RSA implementation for X86\_64 CPUs supporting the AVX512IFMA instructions. This issue makes the RSA implementation with 2048 bit private keys incorrect on such machines and memory corruption will happen during the computation. As a consequence of the memory corruption an attacker may be able to trigger a remote code execution on the machine performing the computation. SSL/TLS servers or other servers using 2048 bit RSA private keys running on machines supporting AVX512IFMA instructions of the X86\_64 architecture are affected by this issue.

In addition to the c\_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances where the c\_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection were found by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there are other places in the script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c\_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool.

The OPENSSL\_LH\_flush() function, which empties a hash table, contains a bug that breaks reuse of the memory occuppied by the removed hash table entries. This function is used when decoding certificates or keys. If a long lived process periodically decodes certificates or keys its memory usage will expand without bounds and the process might be terminated by the operating system causing a denial of service. Also traversing the empty hash table entries will take increasingly more time. Typically such long lived processes might be TLS clients or TLS servers configured to accept client certificate authentication. The function was added in the OpenSSL 3.0 version thus older releases are not affected by the issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 implementation of the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite incorrectly uses the AAD data as the MAC key. This makes the MAC key trivially predictable. An attacker could exploit this issue by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to modify data being sent from one endpoint to an OpenSSL 3.0 recipient such that the modified data would still pass the MAC integrity check. Note that data sent from an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will always be rejected by the recipient and the connection will fail at that point. Many application protocols require data to be sent from the client to the server first. Therefore, in such a case, only an OpenSSL 3.0 server would be impacted when talking to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 client. If both endpoints are OpenSSL 3.0 then the attacker could modify data being sent in both directions. In this case both clients and servers could be affected, regardless of the application protocol. Note that in the absence of an attacker this bug means that an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint communicating with a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will fail to complete the handshake when using this ciphersuite. The confidentiality of data is not impacted by this issue, i.e. an attacker cannot decrypt data that has been encrypted using this ciphersuite - they can only modify it. In order for this attack to work both endpoints must legitimately negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite. This ciphersuite is not compiled by default in OpenSSL 3.0, and is not available within the default provider or the default ciphersuite list. This ciphersuite will never be used if TLSv1.3 has been negotiated. In order for an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to use this ciphersuite the following must have occurred: 1) OpenSSL must have been compiled with the (non-default) compile time option enable-weak-ssl-ciphers 2) OpenSSL must have had the legacy provider explicitly loaded (either through application code or via configuration) 3) The ciphersuite must have been explicitly added to the ciphersuite list 4) The libssl security level must have been set to 0 (default is 1) 5) A version of SSL/TLS below TLSv1.3 must have been negotiated 6) Both endpoints must negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite in preference to any others that both endpoints have in common.

The function `OCSP_basic_verify` verifies the signer certificate on an OCSP response. In the case where the (non-default) flag OCSP\_NOCHECKS is used then the response will be positive (meaning a successful verification) even in the case where the response signing certificate fails to verify. It is anticipated that most users of `OCSP_basic_verify` will not use the OCSP\_NOCHECKS flag. In this case the `OCSP_basic_verify` function will return a negative value (indicating a fatal error) in the case of a certificate verification failure. The normal expected return value in this case would be 0. This issue also impacts the command line OpenSSL âocspâ application. When verifying an ocsp response with the â-no\_cert\_checksâ option the command line application will report that the verification is successful even though it has in fact failed. In this case the incorrect successful response will also be accompanied by error messages showing the failure and contradicting the apparently successful result.

The c\_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c\_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool.

The BN\_mod\_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN\_mod\_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022.

There is a carry propagation bug in the MIPS32 and MIPS64 squaring procedure. Many EC algorithms are affected, including some of the TLS 1.3 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because the pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1m and 3.0.1 on the 15th of December 2021, and the release of 1.0.2zc on the 22nd of February 2022. The issue only affects OpenSSL on MIPS platforms.

Invalid handling of X509\_verify\_cert() internal errors in libssl

Internally libssl in OpenSSL calls X509\_verify\_cert() on the client side to verify a certificate supplied by a server. That function may return a negative return value to indicate an internal error (for example out of memory). Such a negative return value is mishandled by OpenSSL and will cause an IO function (such as SSL\_connect() or SSL\_do\_handshake()) to not indicate success and a subsequent call to SSL\_get\_error() to return the value SSL\_ERROR\_WANT\_RETRY\_VERIFY. This return value is only supposed to be returned by OpenSSL if the application has previously called SSL\_CTX\_set\_cert\_verify\_callback(). Since most applications do not do this the SSL\_ERROR\_WANT\_RETRY\_VERIFY return value from SSL\_get\_error() will be totally unexpected and applications may not behave correctly as a result. The exact behaviour will depend on the application but it could result in crashes, infinite loops or other similar incorrect responses. This issue is made more serious in combination with a separate bug in OpenSSL 3.0 that will cause X509\_verify\_cert() to indicate an internal error when processing a certificate chain. This will occur where a certificate does not include the Subject Alternative Name extension but where a Certificate Authority has enforced name constraints. This issue can occur even with valid chains. By combining the two issues an attacker could induce incorrect, application dependent behaviour.

ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1\_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSLâs own âd2iâ functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1\_STRING\_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1\_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1\_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the âdataâ and âlengthâ fields in the ASN1\_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1\_STRING\_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1\_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1\_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the âdataâ field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1\_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509\_get1\_email(), X509\_REQ\_get1\_email() and X509\_get1\_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1\_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext).

In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function EVP\_PKEY\_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the âoutâ parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the âoutlenâ parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP\_PKEY\_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the âoutâ parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP\_PKEY\_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP\_PKEY\_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated.

The X509\_V\_FLAG\_X509\_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a âpurposeâ has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named âpurposeâ values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509\_V\_FLAG\_X509\_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue.

The OpenSSL public API function X509\_issuer\_and\_serial\_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509\_issuer\_and\_serial\_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default), 3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation of the RSA\_padding\_check\_SSLv23() function. This also affects the RSA\_SSLV23\_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although 1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA\_padding\_check\_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the RSA\_SSLV23\_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j.

The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL\_NAME\_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL\_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL\_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL\_NAME\_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS\_RESP\_verify\_response and TS\_RESP\_verify\_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSLâs s\_server, s\_client and verify tools have support for the â-crl\_downloadâ option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSLâs parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked.

The Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can lead to an attacker being able to compute the pre-master secret in connections which have used a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphersuite. In such a case this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent over that TLS connection. The attack can only be exploited if an implementation re-uses a DH secret across multiple TLS connections. Note that this issue only impacts DH ciphersuites and not ECDH ciphersuites. This issue affects OpenSSL 1.0.2 which is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. OpenSSL 1.1.1 is not vulnerable to this issue.

Server or client applications that call the SSL\_check\_chain() function during or after a TLS 1.3 handshake may crash due to a NULL pointer dereference as a result of incorrect handling of the âsignature\_algorithms\_certâ TLS extension. The crash occurs if an invalid or unrecognised signature algorithm is received from the peer. This could be exploited by a malicious peer in a Denial of Service attack. OpenSSL version 1.1.1d, 1.1.1e, and 1.1.1f are affected by this issue. This issue did not affect OpenSSL versions prior to 1.1.1d.

In situations where an attacker receives automated notification of the success or failure of a decryption attempt an attacker, after sending a very large number of messages to be decrypted, can recover a CMS/PKCS7 transported encryption key or decrypt any RSA encrypted message that was encrypted with the public RSA key, using a Bleichenbacher padding oracle attack. Applications are not affected if they use a certificate together with the private RSA key to the CMS\_decrypt or PKCS7\_decrypt functions to select the correct recipient info to decrypt.

If an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL\_shutdown() twice (once to send a close\_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable ânon-stitchedâ ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL\_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway). AEAD ciphersuites are not impacted.

OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can find a configuration file as well as certificates used for verification in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR, and is configurable with the âprefix / âopenssldir configuration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw configuration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed in a Unix-like environment and the default prefix for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR should be â/usr/localâ. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, find themselves looking at sub-directories of âC:/usr/localâ, which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users to modify OpenSSLâs default configuration, insert CA certificates, modify (or even replace) existing engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, â/usr/local/sslâ is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own âprefix. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time.

There is an overflow bug in the x86\_64 Montgomery squaring procedure used in exponentiation with 512-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN\_mod\_exp may be affected if they use BN\_FLG\_CONSTTIME.

OpenSSL 1.1.1 introduced a rewritten random number generator (RNG). This was intended to include protection in the event of a fork() system call in order to ensure that the parent and child processes did not share the same RNG state. However this protection was not being used in the default case. A partial mitigation for this issue is that the output from a high precision timer is mixed into the RNG state so the likelihood of a parent and child process sharing state is significantly reduced. If an application already calls OPENSSL\_init\_crypto() explicitly using OPENSSL\_INIT\_ATFORK then this problem does not occur at all.

Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this is used in side channel resistant code paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used.

ChaCha20-Poly1305 is an AEAD cipher, and requires a unique nonce input for every encryption operation. RFC 7539 specifies that the nonce value (IV) should be 96 bits (12 bytes). OpenSSL allows a variable nonce length and front pads the nonce with 0 bytes if it is less than 12 bytes. However it also incorrectly allows a nonce to be set of up to 16 bytes. In this case only the last 12 bytes are significant and any additional leading bytes are ignored. It is a requirement of using this cipher that nonce values are unique. Messages encrypted using a reused nonce value are susceptible to serious confidentiality and integrity attacks. If an application changes the default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes and then makes a change to the leading bytes of the nonce expecting the new value to be a new unique nonce then such an application could inadvertently encrypt messages with a reused nonce. Additionally the ignored bytes in a long nonce are not covered by the integrity guarantee of this cipher. Any application that relies on the integrity of these ignored leading bytes of a long nonce may be further affected. Any OpenSSL internal use of this cipher, including in SSL/TLS, is safe because no such use sets such a long nonce value. However user applications that use this cipher directly and set a non-default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes may be vulnerable. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.1.0 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time.

Because of an implementation bug the PA-RISC CRYPTO\_memcmp function is effectively reduced to only comparing the least significant bit of each byte. This allows an attacker to forge messages that would be considered as authenticated in an amount of tries lower than that guaranteed by the security claims of the scheme. The module can only be compiled by the HP-UX assembler, so that only HP-UX PA-RISC targets are affected.

During key agreement in a TLS handshake using a DH(E) based ciphersuite a malicious server can send a very large prime value to the client. This will cause the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time generating a key for this prime resulting in a hang until the client has finished. This could be exploited in a Denial Of Service attack.

There is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions like Intel Haswell (4th generation). Note: The impact from this issue is similar to CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3732 and CVE-2015-3193. Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new release of OpenSSL 1.1.0 at this time. The fix will be included in OpenSSL 1.1.0h when it becomes available. The fix is also available in commit e502cc86d in the OpenSSL git repository.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an âerror stateâ mechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a handshake then OpenSSL would move into the error state and would immediately fail if you attempted to continue the handshake. This works as designed for the explicit handshake functions (SSL\_do\_handshake(), SSL\_accept() and SSL\_connect()), however due to a bug it does not work correctly if SSL\_read() or SSL\_write() is called directly. In that scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error will be returned in the initial function call. If SSL\_read()/SSL\_write() is subsequently called by the application for the same SSL object then it will succeed and the data is passed without being decrypted/encrypted directly from the SSL/TLS record layer. In order to exploit this issue an application bug would have to be present that resulted in a call to SSL\_read()/SSL\_write() being issued after having already received a fatal error.

There is a carry propagating bug in the x86\_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple clients. This only affects processors that support the BMI1, BMI2 and ADX extensions like Intel Broadwell (5th generation) and later or AMD Ryzen.

If an SSL/TLS server or client is running on a 32-bit host, and a specific cipher is being used, then a truncated packet can cause that server or client to perform an out-of-bounds read, usually resulting in a crash. For OpenSSL 1.1.0, the crash can be triggered when using CHACHA20/POLY1305; users should upgrade to 1.1.0d. For Openssl 1.0.2, the crash can be triggered when using RC4-MD5; users who have not disabled that algorithm should update to 1.0.2k.

There is a carry propagating bug in the Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure that handles input lengths divisible by, but longer than 256 bits. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA, DSA and DH private keys are impossible. This is because the subroutine in question is not used in operations with the private key itself and an input of the attackerâs direct choice. Otherwise the bug can manifest itself as transient authentication and key negotiation failures or reproducible erroneous outcome of public-key operations with specially crafted input. Among EC algorithms only Brainpool P-512 curves are affected and one presumably can attack ECDH key negotiation. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely. Namely multiple clients have to choose the curve in question and the server has to share the private key among them, neither of which is default behaviour. Even then only clients that chose the curve will be affected.

Applications parsing invalid CMS structures can crash with a NULL pointer dereference. This is caused by a bug in the handling of the ASN.1 CHOICE type in OpenSSL 1.1.0 which can result in a NULL value being passed to the structure callback if an attempt is made to free certain invalid encodings. Only CHOICE structures using a callback which do not handle NULL value are affected.

This issue only affects OpenSSL 1.1.0a, released on 22nd September 2016. The patch applied to address CVE-2016-6307 resulted in an issue where if a message larger than approx 16k is received then the underlying buffer to store the incoming message is reallocated and moved. Unfortunately a dangling pointer to the old location is left which results in an attempt to write to the previously freed location. This is likely to result in a crash, however it could potentially lead to execution of arbitrary code.

A DTLS message includes 3 bytes for its length in the header for the message. This would allow for messages up to 16Mb in length. Messages of this length are excessive and OpenSSL includes a check to ensure that a peer is sending reasonably sized messages in order to avoid too much memory being consumed to service a connection. A flaw in the logic of version 1.1.0 means that memory for the message is allocated too early, prior to the excessive message length check. Due to way memory is allocated in OpenSSL this could mean an attacker could force up to 21Mb to be allocated to service a connection. This could lead to a Denial of Service through memory exhaustion. However, the excessive message length check still takes place, and this would cause the connection to immediately fail. Assuming that the application calls SSL\_free() on the failed conneciton in a timely manner then the 21Mb of allocated memory will then be immediately freed again. Therefore the excessive memory allocation will be transitory in nature. This then means that there is only a security impact if: 1) The application does not call SSL\_free() in a timely manner in the event that the connection fails or 2) The application is working in a constrained environment where there is very little free memory or 3) The attacker initiates multiple connection attempts such that there are multiple connections in a state where memory has been allocated for the connection; SSL\_free() has not yet been called; and there is insufficient memory to service the multiple requests. Except in the instance of (1) above any Denial Of Service is likely to be transitory because as soon as the connection fails the memory is subsequently freed again in the SSL\_free() call. However there is an increased risk during this period of application crashes due to the lack of memory - which would then mean a more serious Denial of Service.

In OpenSSL 1.0.2 and earlier some missing message length checks can result in OOB reads of up to 2 bytes beyond an allocated buffer. There is a theoretical DoS risk but this has not been observed in practice on common platforms. The messages affected are client certificate, client certificate request and server certificate. As a result the attack can only be performed against a client or a server which enables client authentication.

A malicious client can send an excessively large OCSP Status Request extension. If that client continually requests renegotiation, sending a large OCSP Status Request extension each time, then there will be unbounded memory growth on the server. This will eventually lead to a Denial Of Service attack through memory exhaustion. Servers with a default configuration are vulnerable even if they do not support OCSP. Builds using the âno-ocspâ build time option are not affected. Servers using OpenSSL versions prior to 1.0.1g are not vulnerable in a default configuration, instead only if an application explicitly enables OCSP stapling support.

An overflow can occur in MDC2\_Update() either if called directly or through the EVP\_DigestUpdate() function using MDC2. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data after a previous call to EVP\_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. The amount of data needed is comparable to SIZE\_MAX which is impractical on most platforms.

If a server uses SHA512 for TLS session ticket HMAC it is vulnerable to a DoS attack where a malformed ticket will result in an OOB read which will ultimately crash. The use of SHA512 in TLS session tickets is comparatively rare as it requires a custom server callback and ticket lookup mechanism.

Because DES (and triple-DES) has only a 64-bit block size, birthday attacks are a real concern. For example, with the ability to run Javascript in a browser, it is possible to send enough traffic to cause a collision, and then use that information to recover something like a session Cookie. Triple-DES, which shows up as âDES-CBC3â in an OpenSSL cipher string, is still used on the Web, and major browsers are not yet willing to completely disable it. If you run a server, you should disable triple-DES. This is generally a configuration issue. If you run an old server that doesnât support any better ciphers than DES or RC4, you should upgrade. For 1.0.2 and 1.0.1, we removed the triple-DES ciphers from the âHIGHâ keyword and put them into âMEDIUM.â Note that we did not remove them from the âDEFAULTâ keyword. For the 1.1.0 release, we treat triple-DES just like we are treating RC4. It is not compiled by default; you have to use âenable-weak-ssl-ciphersâ as a config option. Even when those ciphers are compiled, triple-DES is only in the âMEDIUMâ keyword. In addition we also removed it from the âDEFAULTâ keyword.

A flaw in the DTLS replay attack protection mechanism means that records that arrive for future epochs update the replay protection âwindowâ before the MAC for the record has been validated. This could be exploited by an attacker by sending a record for the next epoch (which does not have to decrypt or have a valid MAC), with a very large sequence number. This means that all subsequent legitimate packets are dropped causing a denial of service for a specific DTLS connection.

In a DTLS connection where handshake messages are delivered out-of-order those messages that OpenSSL is not yet ready to process will be buffered for later use. Under certain circumstances, a flaw in the logic means that those messages do not get removed from the buffer even though the handshake has been completed. An attacker could force up to approx. 15 messages to remain in the buffer when they are no longer required. These messages will be cleared when the DTLS connection is closed. The default maximum size for a message is 100k. Therefore the attacker could force an additional 1500k to be consumed per connection. By opening many simulataneous connections an attacker could cause a DoS attack through memory exhaustion.

Avoid some undefined pointer arithmetic A common idiom in the codebase is to check limits in the following manner: âp + len > limitâ Where âpâ points to some mallocâd data of SIZE bytes and limit == p + SIZE âlenâ here could be from some externally supplied data (e.g. from a TLS message). The rules of C pointer arithmetic are such that âp + lenâ is only well defined where len <= SIZE. Therefore the above idiom is actually undefined behaviour. For example this could cause problems if some malloc implementation provides an address for âpâ such that âp + lenâ actually overflows for values of len that are too big and therefore p + len < limit.

This issue affected versions of OpenSSL prior to April 2015. The bug causing the vulnerability was fixed on April 18th 2015, and released as part of the June 11th 2015 security releases. The security impact of the bug was not known at the time. In previous versions of OpenSSL, ASN.1 encoding the value zero represented as a negative integer can cause a buffer underflow with an out-of-bounds write in i2c\_ASN1\_INTEGER. The ASN.1 parser does not normally create ânegative zeroesâ when parsing ASN.1 input, and therefore, an attacker cannot trigger this bug. However, a second, independent bug revealed that the ASN.1 parser (specifically, d2i\_ASN1\_TYPE) can misinterpret a large universal tag as a negative zero value. Large universal tags are not present in any common ASN.1 structures (such as X509) but are accepted as part of ANY structures. Therefore, if an application deserializes untrusted ASN.1 structures containing an ANY field, and later reserializes them, an attacker may be able to trigger an out-of-bounds write. This has been shown to cause memory corruption that is potentially exploitable with some malloc implementations. Applications that parse and re-encode X509 certificates are known to be vulnerable. Applications that verify RSA signatures on X509 certificates may also be vulnerable; however, only certificates with valid signatures trigger ASN.1 re-encoding and hence the bug. Specifically, since OpenSSLâs default TLS X509 chain verification code verifies the certificate chain from root to leaf, TLS handshakes could only be targeted with valid certificates issued by trusted Certification Authorities.

A MITM attacker can use a padding oracle attack to decrypt traffic when the connection uses an AES CBC cipher and the server support AES-NI. This issue was introduced as part of the fix for Lucky 13 padding attack (CVE-2013-0169). The padding check was rewritten to be in constant time by making sure that always the same bytes are read and compared against either the MAC or padding bytes. But it no longer checked that there was enough data to have both the MAC and padding bytes.

An overflow can occur in the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() function. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data after a previous call to EVP\_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. Following an analysis of all OpenSSL internal usage of the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() function all usage is one of two forms. The first form is where the EVP\_EncryptUpdate() call is known to be the first called function after an EVP\_EncryptInit(), and therefore that specific call must be safe. The second form is where the length passed to EVP\_EncryptUpdate() can be seen from the code to be some small value and therefore there is no possibility of an overflow. Since all instances are one of these two forms, it is believed that there can be no overflows in internal code due to this problem. It should be noted that EVP\_DecryptUpdate() can call EVP\_EncryptUpdate() in certain code paths. Also EVP\_CipherUpdate() is a synonym for EVP\_EncryptUpdate(). All instances of these calls have also been analysed too and it is believed there are no instances in internal usage where an overflow could occur. This could still represent a security issue for end user code that calls this function directly.

An overflow can occur in the EVP\_EncodeUpdate() function which is used for Base64 encoding of binary data. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. Internally to OpenSSL the EVP\_EncodeUpdate() function is primarly used by the PEM\_write\_bio\* family of functions. These are mainly used within the OpenSSL command line applications. These internal uses are not considered vulnerable because all calls are bounded with length checks so no overflow is possible. User applications that call these APIs directly with large amounts of untrusted data may be vulnerable. (Note: Initial analysis suggested that the PEM\_write\_bio\* were vulnerable, and this is reflected in the patch commit message. This is no longer believed to be the case).

A cross-protocol attack was discovered that could lead to decryption of TLS sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle. Note that traffic between clients and non-vulnerable servers can be decrypted provided another server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT ciphers (even with a different protocol such as SMTP, IMAP or POP) shares the RSA keys of the non-vulnerable server. This vulnerability is known as DROWN (CVE-2016-0800). Recovering one session key requires the attacker to perform approximately 2^50 computation, as well as thousands of connections to the affected server. A more efficient variant of the DROWN attack exists against unpatched OpenSSL servers using versions that predate 1.0.2a, 1.0.1m, 1.0.0r and 0.9.8zf released on 19/Mar/2015 (see CVE-2016-0703 below). Users can avoid this issue by disabling the SSLv2 protocol in all their SSL/TLS servers, if theyâve not done so already. Disabling all SSLv2 ciphers is also sufficient, provided the patches for CVE-2015-3197 (fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1r and 1.0.2f) have been deployed. Servers that have not disabled the SSLv2 protocol, and are not patched for CVE-2015-3197 are vulnerable to DROWN even if all SSLv2 ciphers are nominally disabled, because malicious clients can force the use of SSLv2 with EXPORT ciphers. OpenSSL 1.0.2g and 1.0.1s deploy the following mitigation against DROWN: SSLv2 is now by default disabled at build-time. Builds that are not configured with âenable-ssl2â will not support SSLv2. Even if âenable-ssl2â is used, users who want to negotiate SSLv2 via the version-flexible SSLv23\_method() will need to explicitly call either of: SSL\_CTX\_clear\_options(ctx, SSL\_OP\_NO\_SSLv2); or SSL\_clear\_options(ssl, SSL\_OP\_NO\_SSLv2); as appropriate. Even if either of those is used, or the application explicitly uses the version-specific SSLv2\_method() or its client or server variants, SSLv2 ciphers vulnerable to exhaustive search key recovery have been removed. Specifically, the SSLv2 40-bit EXPORT ciphers, and SSLv2 56-bit DES are no longer available. In addition, weak ciphers in SSLv3 and up are now disabled in default builds of OpenSSL. Builds that are not configured with âenable-weak-ssl-ciphersâ will not provide any âEXPORTâ or âLOWâ strength ciphers.

The internal |fmtstr| function used in processing a â%sâ format string in the BIO\_\*printf functions could overflow while calculating the length of a string and cause an OOB read when printing very long strings. Additionally the internal |doapr\_outch| function can attempt to write to an OOB memory location (at an offset from the NULL pointer) in the event of a memory allocation failure. In 1.0.2 and below this could be caused where the size of a buffer to be allocated is greater than INT\_MAX. E.g. this could be in processing a very long â%sâ format string. Memory leaks can also occur. The first issue may mask the second issue dependent on compiler behaviour. These problems could enable attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is passed to the BIO\_\*printf functions. If applications use these functions in this way then they could be vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data. Therefore applications that print this data could be vulnerable if the data is from untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line applications could also be vulnerable where they print out ASN.1 data, or if untrusted data is passed as command line arguments. Libssl is not considered directly vulnerable. Additionally certificates etc received via remote connections via libssl are also unlikely to be able to trigger these issues because of message size limits enforced within libssl.

The SRP user database lookup method SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user had confusing memory management semantics; the returned pointer was sometimes newly allocated, and sometimes owned by the callee. The calling code has no way of distinguishing these two cases. Specifically, SRP servers that configure a secret seed to hide valid login information are vulnerable to a memory leak: an attacker connecting with an invalid username can cause a memory leak of around 300 bytes per connection. Servers that do not configure SRP, or configure SRP but do not configure a seed are not vulnerable. In Apache, the seed directive is known as SSLSRPUnknownUserSeed. To mitigate the memory leak, the seed handling in SRP\_VBASE\_get\_by\_user is now disabled even if the user has configured a seed. Applications are advised to migrate to SRP\_VBASE\_get1\_by\_user. However, note that OpenSSL makes no strong guarantees about the indistinguishability of valid and invalid logins. In particular, computations are currently not carried out in constant time.

In the BN\_hex2bn function the number of hex digits is calculated using an int value |i|. Later |bn\_expand| is called with a value of |i \* 4|. For large values of |i| this can result in |bn\_expand| not allocating any memory because |i \* 4| is negative. This can leave the internal BIGNUM data field as NULL leading to a subsequent NULL ptr deref. For very large values of |i|, the calculation |i \* 4| could be a positive value smaller than |i|. In this case memory is allocated to the internal BIGNUM data field, but it is insufficiently sized leading to heap corruption. A similar issue exists in BN\_dec2bn. This could have security consequences if BN\_hex2bn/BN\_dec2bn is ever called by user applications with very large untrusted hex/dec data. This is anticipated to be a rare occurrence. All OpenSSL internal usage of these functions use data that is not expected to be untrusted, e.g. config file data or application command line arguments. If user developed applications generate config file data based on untrusted data then it is possible that this could also lead to security consequences. This is also anticipated to be rare.

This issue only affected versions of OpenSSL prior to March 19th 2015 at which time the code was refactored to address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. s2\_srvr.c did not enforce that clear-key-length is 0 for non-export ciphers. If clear-key bytes are present for these ciphers, they *displace* encrypted-key bytes. This leads to an efficient divide-and-conquer key recovery attack: if an eavesdropper has intercepted an SSLv2 handshake, they can use the server as an oracle to determine the SSLv2 master-key, using only 16 connections to the server and negligible computation. More importantly, this leads to a more efficient version of DROWN that is effective against non-export ciphersuites, and requires no significant computation.

A side-channel attack was found which makes use of cache-bank conflicts on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture which could lead to the recovery of RSA keys. The ability to exploit this issue is limited as it relies on an attacker who has control of code in a thread running on the same hyper-threaded core as the victim thread which is performing decryptions.

Historically OpenSSL usually only ever generated DH parameters based on âsafeâ primes. More recently (in version 1.0.2) support was provided for generating X9.42 style parameter files such as those required for RFC 5114 support. The primes used in such files may not be âsafeâ. Where an application is using DH configured with parameters based on primes that are not âsafeâ then an attacker could use this fact to find a peerâs private DH exponent. This attack requires that the attacker complete multiple handshakes in which the peer uses the same private DH exponent. For example this could be used to discover a TLS serverâs private DH exponent if itâs reusing the private DH exponent or itâs using a static DH ciphersuite. OpenSSL provides the option SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE for ephemeral DH (DHE) in TLS. It is not on by default. If the option is not set then the server reuses the same private DH exponent for the life of the server process and would be vulnerable to this attack. It is believed that many popular applications do set this option and would therefore not be at risk. OpenSSL before 1.0.2f will reuse the key if: - SSL\_CTX\_set\_tmp\_dh()/SSL\_set\_tmp\_dh() is used and SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE is not set. - SSL\_CTX\_set\_tmp\_dh\_callback()/SSL\_set\_tmp\_dh\_callback() is used, and both the parameters and the key are set and SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE is not used. This is an undocumted feature and parameter files donât contain the key. - Static DH ciphersuites are used. The key is part of the certificate and so it will always reuse it. This is only supported in 1.0.2. It will not reuse the key for DHE ciphers suites if: - SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE is set - SSL\_CTX\_set\_tmp\_dh\_callback()/SSL\_set\_tmp\_dh\_callback() is used and the callback does not provide the key, only the parameters. The callback is almost always used like this. Non-safe primes are generated by OpenSSL when using: - genpkey with the dh\_rfc5114 option. This will write an X9.42 style file including the prime-order subgroup size âqâ. This is supported since the 1.0.2 version. Older versions canât read files generated in this way. - dhparam with the -dsaparam option. This has always been documented as requiring the single use. The fix for this issue adds an additional check where a âqâ parameter is available (as is the case in X9.42 based parameters). This detects the only known attack, and is the only possible defense for static DH ciphersuites. This could have some performance impact. Additionally the SSL\_OP\_SINGLE\_DH\_USE option has been switched on by default and cannot be disabled. This could have some performance impact.

There is a carry propagating bug in the x86\_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple clients. For example this can occur by default in OpenSSL DHE based SSL/TLS ciphersuites.

* [OpenSSL Advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20150108.txt)

OpenSSL accepts several non-DER-variations of certificate signature algorithm and signature encodings. OpenSSL also does not enforce a match between the signature algorithm between the signed and unsigned portions of the certificate. By modifying the contents of the signature algorithm or the encoding of the signature, it is possible to change the certificateâs fingerprint. This does not allow an attacker to forge certificates, and does not affect certificate verification or OpenSSL servers/clients in any other way. It also does not affect common revocation mechanisms. Only custom applications that rely on the uniqueness of the fingerprint (e.g. certificate blacklists) may be affected.

Bignum squaring (BN\_sqr) may produce incorrect results on some platforms, including x86\_64. This bug occurs at random with a very low probability, and is not known to be exploitable in any way, though its exact impact is difficult to determine. The following has been determined: \*) The probability of BN\_sqr producing an incorrect result at random is very low: 1/2^64 on the single affected 32-bit platform (MIPS) and 1/2^128 on affected 64-bit platforms. \*) On most platforms, RSA follows a different code path and RSA operations are not affected at all. For the remaining platforms (e.g. OpenSSL built without assembly support), pre-existing countermeasures thwart bug attacks [1]. \*) Static ECDH is theoretically affected: it is possible to construct elliptic curve points that would falsely appear to be on the given curve. However, there is no known computationally feasible way to construct such points with low order, and so the security of static ECDH private keys is believed to be unaffected. \*) Other routines known to be theoretically affected are modular exponentiation, primality testing, DSA, RSA blinding, JPAKE and SRP. No exploits are known and straightforward bug attacks fail - either the attacker cannot control when the bug triggers, or no private key material is involved.

The Google Security Team discovered several functions inside OpenSSL incorrectly checked the result after calling the EVP\_VerifyFinal function, allowing a malformed signature to be treated as a good signature rather than as an error. This issue affected the signature checks on DSA and ECDSA keys used with SSL/TLS. One way to exploit this flaw would be for a remote attacker who is in control of a malicious server or who can use a âman in the middleâ attack to present a malformed SSL/TLS signature from a certificate chain to a vulnerable client, bypassing validation.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.1 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 7.4 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.4 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 7.4 |

#### Description

The X509\_V\_FLAG\_X509\_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a "purpose" has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named "purpose" values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509\_V\_FLAG\_X509\_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected 1.1.1h-1.1.1j).

#### Description

Calls to EVP\_CipherUpdate, EVP\_EncryptUpdate and EVP\_DecryptUpdate may overflow the output length argument in some cases where the input length is close to the maximum permissable length for an integer on the platform. In such cases the return value from the function call will be 1 (indicating success), but the output length value will be negative. This could cause applications to behave incorrectly or crash. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

While I am neither Wind River nor OpenSSL, I did notice on the linked
page that the upper right hand corner says:
Released: Apr 22, 2020     Updated: Mar 22, 2021

Without knowing much else, it feels like someone accidentally put a
"released" date as last year and the content management system went
ahead and made the article public. Hard to say without confirmation,
but I could definitely see that being the chain of events.

Subject: OpenSSL 1.1.1 CVE-2021-3450 CA certificate check bypass with X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT, CVE-2021-3449 NULL pointer deref in signature_algorithms processing

Hi,

As many of you are aware, the OpenSSL project provides pre-notification
of vulnerability disclosures.  The way they do it is by posting to the
public OpenSSL mailing lists (see "Forthcoming OpenSSL release" below)
and by contacting specific other projects/channels with an offer to
provide the actual detail more privately only to those interested in
such detail.  This time, not unlike other times, there was a message to
the distros list with content similar to the public "Forthcoming OpenSSL
release" below plus the offer I mentioned.  Since the message itself did
not contain any vulnerability detail, it might not strictly fall under
the distros list policy of requiring a subsequent oss-security posting,
but I think it's preferable to proceed with such postings in such cases.
So I am doing that now (the "OpenSSL Security Advisory" below), and I'd
like the OpenSSL project itself to be doing it going forward.

One other detail I feel I have to bring up in here, and expect a
response to, is Wind River's apparent leak of the vulnerability detail
two days prior to scheduled public disclosure.  This was brought up on
the distros list back then, and I was also asked about it on Twitter
when the vulnerabilities were finally made public appropriately on the
scheduled date.

Since the vulnerability detail wasn't on the distros list, it's not
exactly a case of a list member leaking from there, but it's closely
related.  And regardless of where this happened, it's a concern, which
we probably should discuss on oss-security.

So I'd appreciate an explanation/statement from Wind River on what
happened and what measures, if any, are being taken to prevent this from
happening again.  I'd also appreciate a comment from OpenSSL.

The leak was on a web page archived here:

[https://web.archive.org/web/20210324105700/https://support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=security-notices&on=view&id=7055](https://web.archive.org/web/20210324105700/https%3A//support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=security-notices&on=view&id=7055)

As I recall, the private GitHub links in there gave me "404 Not Found"
soon after the windriver.com link (which was live at the time, not
needing archive.org) was sent to the distros list by a concerned fellow
distro.  This means that either OpenSSL promptly brought them down or
they were only ever accessible under appropriately privileged GitHub
accounts.  In the latter case, the existence of that web page with its
content might not have been that much of a leak, as in addition to the
public pre-notification the web page only contained CVE IDs and one-line
vulnerability titles and commit hashes and those GitHub links.  If the
actual commits and the links were never publicly accessible, then it
wasn't that much of an issue and reasonably didn't require considering
the embargo broken.

Another concern I have is that I have to write this to ever hear from
Wind River.  I'd have expected them to comment on the distros list the
moment this was brought up in there - but they kept silent.  Did they
even see the message?  (Of course, I could ask privately, but the
concerns are already public and we need to discuss this in public.)

To summarize, this is probably not a big deal, but let's figure out what
happened and what can be done better next time.

Thanks,

Alexander

OpenSSL Security Advisory [25 March 2021]
=========================================

CA certificate check bypass with X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT (CVE-2021-3450)
========================================================================

Severity: High

The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the
certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default.

Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in
the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added
as an additional strict check.

An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a
previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA
certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check
that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates.

If a "purpose" has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity
for checks that the certificate is a valid CA.  All of the named "purpose"
values implemented in libcrypto perform this check.  Therefore, where
a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the
strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and
server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or
removed by an application.

In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the
X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose
for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server
applications, override the default purpose.

OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these
versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue.

This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 18th March 2021 by Benjamin Kaduk
from Akamai and was discovered by Xiang Ding and others at Akamai. The fix was
developed by Tom???? Mr??z.

NULL pointer deref in signature_algorithms processing (CVE-2021-3449)
=====================================================================

Severity: High

An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation
ClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits
the signature_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial
ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension then a NULL
pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service
attack.

A server is only vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which
is the default configuration). OpenSSL TLS clients are not impacted by this
issue.

All OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions are affected by this issue. Users of these versions
should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue.

This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 17th March 2021 by Nokia. The fix was
developed by Peter K??stle and Samuel Sapalski from Nokia.

Note
====

OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Extended
support is available for premium support customers:
<https://www.openssl.org/support/contracts.html>

OpenSSL 1.1.0 is out of support and no longer receiving updates of any kind.
The impact of these issues on OpenSSL 1.1.0 has not been analysed.

Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1.

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-2751-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                       Christoph Berg
August 31, 2021                               <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : postgresql-9.6
Version        : 9.6.23-0+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-3449

PostgreSQL 9.6.23 fixes this security issue:

  Disallow SSL renegotiation more completely (Michael Paquier)

  SSL renegotiation has been disabled for some time, but the server would
  still cooperate with a client-initiated renegotiation request. A
  maliciously crafted renegotiation request could result in a server crash
  (see OpenSSL issue CVE-2021-3449).  Disable the feature altogether on
  OpenSSL versions that permit doing so, which are 1.1.0h and newer.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
9.6.23-0+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-9.6 packages.

For the detailed security status of postgresql-9.6 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/postgresql-9.6>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

#### Description

An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature\_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature\_algorithms\_cert extension then a NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack. A server is only vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which is the default configuration). OpenSSL TLS clients are not impacted by this issue. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1j).

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 520 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2857016.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1).

"text": "OpenSSL Certificate Validation Vulnerability\r\nOpenSSL contains a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to use a valid non-certificate authority (CA) certificate to act as a CA and sign a certificate for an arbitrary organization, user, or device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a bypassed check in the validation logic of X.509 certificate chains, resulting in the affected system accepting as valid certificates signed by a non-CA certificate or certificate chain. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using any valid certificate or certificate chain to sign a crafted certificate. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct a main-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack and obtain sensitive information (or misreport information) or impersonate an organization, user, or device. Exploitation of this vulnerability could also allow attackers to access networks or assets that are protected by certificate authentication.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID:\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-3450\r\n OpenSSL NULL Pointer Dereference Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nOpenSSL contains a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on a targeted system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the affected software incorrectly handles memory structures, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by submitting crafted Transport Layer Security (TLS) packets to an interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a crash of the TLS server process which could result in a DoS condition on the targeted device.\r\n\r\nNote: Only servers that are processing incoming TLSv1.2 packets are affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID:\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-3449"

# [R1] Nessus Network Monitor 5.13.1 Fixes Multiple Third-party Vulnerabilities

Medium

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Nessus Network Monitor leverages third-party software to help provide underlying functionality. One of the third-party components (OpenSSL) was found to contain vulnerabilities, and updated versions have been made available by the providers.

Out of caution and in line with good practice, Tenable opted to upgrade the bundled OpenSSL components to address the potential impact of these issues. Nessus Network Monitor 5.13.1 updates OpenSSL to version 1.1.1k to address the identified vulnerabilities.

### Solution

Tenable has released Nessus Network Monitor 5.13.1 to address these issues. The installation files can be obtained from the Tenable Downloads Portal (https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus-network-monitor).

# Security Policy

## Reporting security issues

If you wish to report a possible security issue in OpenSSL please
[notify us](/community/#reporting-security-bugssecurityreports).

## Issue triage

Notifications are received by the OMC and OTC. We engage resources within
OpenSSL to start the investigation and prioritisation. We may work in
private with individuals who are not on the OMC or OTC as well as other
organisations and our [employers](/community/thanks/)
where we believe this can help with the issue investigation, resolution, or
testing.

## Threat Model

Certain threats are currently considered outside of the scope of the
OpenSSL threat model. Accordingly, we do not consider OpenSSL secure
against the following classes of attacks:

* same physical system side channel
* CPU/hardware flaws
* physical fault injection
* physical observation side channels (e.g. power consumption,
  EM emissions, etc)

Mitigations for security issues outside of our threat scope may still be
addressed, however we do not class these as OpenSSL vulnerabilities and
will therefore not issue CVEs for any mitigations to address these issues.

We are working towards making the same physical system side channel attacks
very hard.

Prior to the threat model being included in this policy, CVEs were sometimes
issued for these classes of attacks. The existence of a previous CVE does
not override this policy going forward.

## Issue severity

We will determine the risk of each issue, taking into account our experience
dealing with past issues, versions affected, common defaults, and use cases.
We use the following severity categories:

* **CRITICAL** Severity. This affects common
  configurations and which are also likely to be exploitable. Examples
  include significant disclosure of the contents of server memory
  (potentially revealing user details), vulnerabilities which can be easily
  exploited remotely to compromise server private keys or where remote code
  execution is considered likely in common situations. These issues will be
  kept private and will trigger a new release of all supported versions. We
  will attempt to address these as soon as possible.
* **HIGH** Severity. This includes issues that are of a
  lower risk than critical, perhaps due to affecting less common
  configurations, or which are less likely to be exploitable. These issues
  will be kept private and will trigger a new release of all supported
  versions. We will attempt to keep the time these issues are private to a
  minimum; our aim would be no longer than a month where this is something
  under our control.
* **MODERATE** Severity. This includes issues like
  crashes in client applications, flaws in protocols that are less commonly
  used (such as DTLS), and local flaws. These will in general be kept
  private until the next release, and that release will be scheduled so
  that it can roll up several such flaws at one time.
* **LOW** Severity. This includes issues such as those
  that only affect the openssl command line utility, or unlikely
  configurations. These will in general be fixed immediately in latest
  development versions, and may be backported to older versions that are
  still getting updates. We will update the vulnerabilities page and note
  the issue CVE in the changelog and commit message, but they may not
  trigger new releases.

## Prenotification policy

* Where we are planning an update that fixes security issues we will notify
  the [openssl-announce list](https://groups.google.com/a/openssl.org/g/openssl-announce/)
  and update the OpenSSL website to give our scheduled update release date
  and time and the severity of issues being fixed by the update. No further
  information about the issues will be given.
* Where we are planning an update that include CRITICAL, HIGH, or MODERATE severity
  issues we will also prenotify certain organisations with more details
  and patches.
  + The organisations we prenotify include those that produce a general
    purpose OS that uses OpenSSL as included on [this list of Operating
    System distribution security contacts](http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros).
  + We also include other open source projects that are derived from OpenSSL
    which have a significant user base and a reciprocal arrangement.
  + We may also include other organisations that are not listed but would
    otherwise qualify for list membership.
  + We may also include organisations with which we have a commercial
    relationship.
  + We may withdraw notifying certain organisations from future
    prenotifications if they leak issues before they are public or over time
    do not add value.

Note: researchers or intermediaries who notify us of issues may have their
own prenotification policy in addition to ours.

## Principles

The policy above is guided by our security principles:

* It’s in the best interests of the Internet as a whole to get fixes for
  OpenSSL security issues out quickly. OpenSSL embargoes should be measured
  in days and weeks, not months or years.
* Many sites affected by OpenSSL issues will be running a version of OpenSSL
  they got from some vendor (and likely bundled with an operating system).
  The most effective way for these sites to get protected is to get an
  updated version from that vendor.

# [R1] LCE 6.0.9 Fixes Multiple Third-party Vulnerabilities

High

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Tenable Log Correlation Engine leverages third-party software to help provide underlying functionality. Two separate third-party components (OpenSSL, jQuery) were found to contain vulnerabilities, and updated versions have been made available by the providers.

Out of caution and in line with good practice, Tenable opted to upgrade the bundled OpenSSL and jQuery components to address the potential impact of these issues. LCE 6.0.9 updates OpenSSL to version 1.1.1k and jQuery to version 3.5.1 to address the identified vulnerabilities.

### Solution

Tenable has released Log Correlation Engine 6.0.9 to address these issues. The installation files can be obtained from the Tenable Downloads Portal (https://www.tenable.com/downloads/log-correlation-engine).

*This page contains information regarding security vulnerabilities that may impact Tenable's products. This may include issues specific to our software, or due to the use of third-party libraries within our software. Tenable strongly encourages users to ensure that they upgrade or apply relevant patches in a timely manner.*

*Tenable takes product security very seriously. If you believe you have found a vulnerability in one of our products, we ask that you please work with us to quickly resolve it in order to protect customers.
Tenable believes in responding quickly to such reports, maintaining communication with researchers, and providing a solution in short order.*

*For more details on submitting vulnerability information, please see our [Vulnerability Reporting Guidelines](/security/report) page.*

*If you have questions or corrections about this advisory, please email
[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8eefeaf8e7fde1fce7ebfdcefaebe0efece2eba0ede1e3)*

FreeBSD-SA-21:07.openssl Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Multiple vulnerabilities in OpenSSL
Category: contrib
Module: openssl
Announced: 2021-03-25
Affects: FreeBSD 12.2 and later
Corrected: 2021-03-25 15:45:19 UTC (stable/13, 13.0-STABLE)
2021-03-25 16:25:06 UTC (releng/13.0, 13.0-RC3-p1)
2021-03-25 17:14:46 UTC (stable/12, 12.2-STABLE)
2021-03-25 23:45:45 UTC (releng/12.2, 12.2-RELEASE-p5)
CVE Name: CVE-2021-3449, CVE-2021-3450
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
FreeBSD includes software from the OpenSSL Project. The OpenSSL Project is a
collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured
Open Source toolkit for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. It is
also a general-purpose cryptography library.
II. Problem Description
This advisory covers two distinct OpenSSL issues:
The X509\_V\_FLAG\_X509\_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the
certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default.
Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the
chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an
additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant
that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain
are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the
check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates.
[CVE-2021-3450]
A TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello message sent to a TLS server that omits
the signature\_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial
ClientHello), but includes a signature\_algorithms\_cert extension results in a
NULL pointer dereference in the server. [CVE-2021-3449]
III. Impact
The X509\_V\_FLAG\_X509\_STRICT issue can result in a bypass of the check that
non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates.
The renegotiation issue can result in a crash and a denial of service attack.
IV. Workaround
For the X509\_V\_FLAG\_X509\_STRICT issue, no workaround is available, but
software that doesn't explicitly set the X509\_V\_FLAG\_X509\_STRICT flag is
unaffected.
For the renegotiation issue, either turning off TLSv1.2 (as TLSv1.3 is
unaffected) or turning off renegotiation on the TLS server mitigates the
issue.
V. Solution
Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
Perform one of the following:
1) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
#
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 13.x]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-21:07/openssl-13.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-21:07/openssl-13.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl-13.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 12.x]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-21:07/openssl-12.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-21:07/openssl-12.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl-12.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

#### Description

The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL\_NAME\_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL\_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL\_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL\_NAME\_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS\_RESP\_verify\_response and TS\_RESP\_verify\_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s\_server, s\_client and verify tools have support for the "-crl\_download" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).

The vulnerability is due to a bypassed check in the validation logic of X.509 certificate chains, resulting in the affected system accepting as valid certificates signed by a non-CA certificate or certificate chain. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using any valid certificate or certificate chain to sign a crafted certificate. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct a main-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack and obtain sensitive information (or misreport information) or impersonate an organization, user, or device. Exploitation of this vulnerability could also allow attackers to access networks or assets that are protected by certificate authentication.  This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID:    + CVE-2021-3450OpenSSL NULL Pointer Dereference Denial of Service Vulnerability OpenSSL contains a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on a targeted system.  The vulnerability exists because the affected software incorrectly handles memory structures, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by submitting crafted Transport Layer Security (TLS) packets to an interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a crash of the *TLS server* process which could result in a DoS condition on the targeted device.  **Note:** Only servers that are processing incoming TLSv1.2 packets are affected by this vulnerability.  This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID:    + CVE-2021-3449  Workarounds  * Any workarounds will be documented in the product-specific Cisco bugs, which are identified in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory.  Fixed Software  * For information about [fixed software releases](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), consult the Cisco bugs identified in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 349 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2880220.1).

**Please note that since the release of the April 2022 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released a Security Alert for Oracle E-Business Suite [CVE-2022-21500 (May 19, 2022)](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2022-21500.html). Customers are strongly advised to apply the July 2022 Critical Patch Update for Oracle E-Business Suite, which includes patches for this Alert as well as additional patches.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Description

There is an overflow bug in the x64\_64 Montgomery squaring procedure used in exponentiation with 512-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN\_mod\_exp may be affected if they use BN\_FLG\_CONSTTIME. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1e (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1d). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2u (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2t).

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC Process Historian is the long term archive system for SIMATIC PCS 7, SIMATIC WinCC and
SIMATIC PCS neo. It stores process values, alarms and batch data of production plants in its database
and offers historical process data to reporting and visualization applications.

SIMATIC RF600 Readers are used for the contactless identification of every kind of object, e.g. transport
containers, pallets, production goods, or it can be generally used for recording goods in bulk.

RUGGEDCOM CROSSBOW is a secure access management solution designed to provide NERC CIP
compliant access to Intelligent Electronic Devices.

SCALANCE LPE9000 (Local Processing Engine) extends the SCALANCE family portfolio by a component
that provides computing power for a wide range of applications in the network, close to the process –
Edge Computing.

SCALANCE M-800, MUM-800 and S615 as well as the RUGGEDCOM RM1224 are industrial routers.

SCALANCE S-600 devices (S602, S612, S623, S627-2M) are used to protect trusted industrial networks
from untrusted networks. The S-600 devices are superseded by the SCALANCE SC-600 devices
(SC622-2C, SC632-2C, SC636-2C, SC642-2C, SC646-2C), or the SCALANCE S615.

SCALANCE SC-600 devices are used to protect trusted industrial networks from untrusted networks.
They allow filtering incoming and outgoing network connections in different ways.

SCALANCE W-1700 products are wireless communication devices based on IEEE 802.11ac standard.
They are used to connect all to sorts of WLAN devices (Access Points or Clients, depending on the
operating mode) with a strong focus on industrial components, like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) and others.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.first.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-3449

An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello message
from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature_algorithms extension (where
it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension then a
NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack. A server is only
vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which is the default configuration). OpenSSL
TLS clients are not impacted by this issue. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions are affected by this issue.
Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this
issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1j).

OpenSSL Security Advisory [25 March 2021]
=========================================
CA certificate check bypass with X509\_V\_FLAG\_X509\_STRICT (CVE-2021-3450)
========================================================================
Severity: High
The X509\_V\_FLAG\_X509\_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the
certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default.
Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in
the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added
as an additional strict check.
An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a
previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA
certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check
that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates.
If a "purpose" has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity
for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named "purpose"
values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where
a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the
strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and
server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or
removed by an application.
In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the
X509\_V\_FLAG\_X509\_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose
for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server
applications, override the default purpose.
OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these
versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue.
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 18th March 2021 by Benjamin Kaduk
from Akamai and was discovered by Xiang Ding and others at Akamai. The fix was
developed by TomÃ¡Å¡ MrÃ¡z.
NULL pointer deref in signature\_algorithms processing (CVE-2021-3449)
=====================================================================
Severity: High
An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation
ClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits
the signature\_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial
ClientHello), but includes a signature\_algorithms\_cert extension then a NULL
pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service
attack.
A server is only vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which
is the default configuration). OpenSSL TLS clients are not impacted by this
issue.
All OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions are affected by this issue. Users of these versions
should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue.
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 17th March 2021 by Nokia. The fix was
developed by Peter KÃ¤stle and Samuel Sapalski from Nokia.
Note
====
OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Extended
support is available for premium support customers:
https://www.openssl.org/support/contracts.html
OpenSSL 1.1.0 is out of support and no longer receiving updates of any kind.
The impact of these issues on OpenSSL 1.1.0 has not been analysed.
Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1.

When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

#### Description

The OpenSSL public API function X509\_issuer\_and\_serial\_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509\_issuer\_and\_serial\_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 342 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2788740.1).

### Affected Products and Patch Information

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed below. The product area is shown in the Patch Availability Document column.

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

The vulnerability is due to a bypassed check in the validation logic of X.509 certificate chains, resulting in the affected system accepting as valid certificates signed by a non-CA certificate or certificate chain. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using any valid certificate or certificate chain to sign a crafted certificate. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct a main-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack and obtain sensitive information (or misreport information) or impersonate an organization, user, or device. Exploitation of this vulnerability could also allow attackers to access networks or assets that are protected by certificate authentication.  This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID:    + CVE-2021-3450OpenSSL NULL Pointer Dereference Denial of Service Vulnerability OpenSSL contains a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on a targeted system.  The vulnerability exists because the affected software incorrectly handles memory structures, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by submitting crafted Transport Layer Security (TLS) packets to an interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a crash of the *TLS server* process which could result in a DoS condition on the targeted device.  **Note:** Only servers that are processing incoming TLSv1.2 packets are affected by this vulnerability.  This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID:    + CVE-2021-3449  Workarounds  * Any workarounds will be documented in the product-specific Cisco bugs, which are identified in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory.  Fixed Software  * For information about [fixed software releases](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), consult the Cisco bugs identified in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 419 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2809080.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 38 new security patches for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  30 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html#FMW)

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security updates are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the Critical Patch Update October 2021 to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update October 2021 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2796575.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2796575.1).

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 391 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2765149.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 70 new security patches plus additional third party patches noted below for Oracle E-Business Suite.  22 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2021verbose.html#EBS)

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2021 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (April 2021), [My Oracle Support Note 2759182.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2759182.1).

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 9 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.  8 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2021verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2021 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2021 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2749094.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2749094.1).

# [R1] Nessus 8.13.2 Fixes Multiple Third-party Vulnerabilities

Medium

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Nessus leverages third-party software to help provide underlying functionality. One of the third-party components (OpenSSL) was found to contain vulnerabilities, and updated versions have been made available by the providers.

Out of caution and in line with good practice, Tenable opted to upgrade the bundled OpenSSL components to address the potential impact of these issues. Nessus 8.13.2 updates OpenSSL to version 1.1.1k to address the identified vulnerabilities.

### Solution

Tenable has released Nessus 8.13.2 to address these issues. The installation files can be obtained from the Tenable Downloads Portal (https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus).

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |

| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.

| **Additional Public Relations** | media\_pr@cisco.com |

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.
