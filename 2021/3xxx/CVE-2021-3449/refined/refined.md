Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2021-3449 and CVE-2021-3450:

**CVE-2021-3449**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** A NULL pointer dereference occurs within the OpenSSL TLS server when processing a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello message. Specifically, this happens when a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the `signature_algorithms` extension (which was present in the initial ClientHello) but includes a `signature_algorithms_cert` extension.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The vulnerability is caused by a missing check for a NULL pointer when processing the `signature_algorithms` extension, leading to a dereference of the NULL pointer.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful attack results in a server crash, causing a denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A malicious TLS client sends a specially crafted renegotiation ClientHello message to a vulnerable OpenSSL TLS server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a TLS connection with a vulnerable server and initiate a renegotiation handshake.

**CVE-2021-3450**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: An error exists in the implementation of the X509\_V\_FLAG\_X509\_STRICT flag which is meant to enable additional security checks on the certificates in a chain. When a check was added to disallow certificates with explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters it overwrites a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates. This bypasses the check that non-CA certificates should not be able to sign other certificates.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Improper Certificate Validation:** The primary weakness is the bypass of the CA certificate validation, which allows non-CA certificates to issue other certificates.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to use a valid leaf certificate to act as a CA and sign a certificate for an arbitrary organization, user, or device.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A malicious actor provides a certificate chain that contains a certificate with explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters, which also bypasses the CA check and would be used as a CA, also an application must explicitly set the `X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT` flag
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker requires the ability to provide a certificate chain that bypasses the strict checks and have the targeted application explicitly use the `X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT` flag (and possibly override the default purpose).

**Additional Information from Content:**

*   **OpenSSL Versions Affected:**
    *   CVE-2021-3449: All OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions (1.1.1 to 1.1.1j) are affected. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not affected.
    *   CVE-2021-3450: OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and later up to 1.1.1j are affected. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not affected.
*   **Fixes:**
    *   Both vulnerabilities are fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k.
*   **Siemens Advisory:** The Siemens advisory (SSA-772220) provides information that both these CVEs are applicable to various Siemens products, especially products with OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions prior to 1.1.1k. It highlights that a crafted renegotiation message can cause a DoS. The advisory recommends updating to the latest versions and applying workarounds such as using TLS v1.3 only where possible.
*   **Wind River Leak:** There was an accidental pre-disclosure of the vulnerabilities by Wind River due to an incorrect "released" date in their content management system. This leak occurred before the planned public disclosure date.
* **Cisco Advisories:** Cisco Security Advisory documents a list of affected Cisco products and their fixes.
*   **Tenable:** Tenable identifies these CVEs in their products, emphasizing the need to upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k and provides detection plugins for these vulnerabilities.
*   **Debian:** A Debian LTS advisory confirms that CVE-2021-3449 was fixed in postgresql-9.6 version 9.6.23-0+deb9u1 and that OpenSSL version 1.1.1k has the fix.

In summary, CVE-2021-3449 is a denial-of-service vulnerability due to a NULL pointer dereference, while CVE-2021-3450 is a certificate validation bypass due to an error in implementation of strict certificate checking that allows for certificate spoofing. Both are high severity and fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k. Both vulnerabilities primarily impact servers but the certificate bypass (CVE-2021-3450) also requires an application to use specific settings.
