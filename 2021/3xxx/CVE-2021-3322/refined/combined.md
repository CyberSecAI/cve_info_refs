# Unexpected Pointer Aliasing in IEEE 802154 Fragment Reassembly in Zephyr

Moderate

[d3zd3z](/d3zd3z)
published
GHSA-p86r-gc4r-4mq3
Oct 12, 2021

## Package

zephyr
(west)

## Affected versions

>=2.4.0

## Patched versions

v2.5.0

## Description

# 4. Unexpected Pointer Aliasing in IEEE 802154 Fragment Reassembly

* Bug Description: Fragment reassembly cache handling crashes in case a fragment is typed for fragmentation, but itself contains the full payload.
* Bug Result: A NULL pointer is de-referenced as an assumed-to-be-valid pointer to a network packet structure.
* Bug Impact: Denial of Service (DOS) of the target by an attacker sending a single malformed IEEE 802154 fragment.

## Bug Details

* Affected code: Fragment reassembly logic in subsys/net/l2/ieee802154/ieee802154\_fragment.c#fragment\_add\_to\_cache

High-Level reasoning for bug occurrence:

1. A cache structure holds a list of previously sent ieee802154 which are gathered for later re-assembly
2. Reassembly is only necessary in case multiple (small radio-layer) fragments are required to represent the whole payload.
3. Reassembly logic implicitly assumes that multiple fragments are present before reassembly is triggered
4. This, it is unaware of the situation where the start of the cache list may actually be the newly added fragment itself
5. This leads to an unexpected alias between two pointers, and cleanup logic corrupts the packet structure

## Vulnerable code path:

ieee802154\_manage\_recv\_packet->ieee802154\_reassemble->fragment\_add\_to\_cache accepts an incoming fragment which is marked for fragmentation

1. If the fragment is the first of its set (indicated by the tag number), a new reassembly cache is requested

  |  | cache = set\_reass\_cache(pkt, size, tag); |
  | --- | --- |

2. It is then checked whether the fragments corresponding to the cache add up to the full indicated payload size

  | --- | --- |

3. To prepare reassembly, the current packet is assigned the buffer of the first packet in the cache's list

  |  | pkt->buffer = cache->pkt->buffer; |
  | --- | --- |

4. To avoid the additional reference in the first fragment in the cache's list, the first list entry's pointer is cleared to NULL

* Link:

  [zephyr/subsys/net/l2/ieee802154/ieee802154\_fragment.c](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/d969aced6dd9ef7834d21ff8131aa561e71cc42d/subsys/net/l2/ieee802154/ieee802154_fragment.c#L520)

  |  | cache->pkt->buffer = NULL; |
  | --- | --- |

BUG: The issue arises where the currently added packet also is the start of the cache list, which arises if the first packet which is sent also contains the full payload. In the following code snippet, this leads to the condition `pkt == cache->pkt`. Thus, the assignment `cache->pkt->buffer = NULL;` sets `pkt->buffer=NULL`.

```
	fragment_append(cache->pkt, frag);

	if (fragment_cached_pkt_len(cache->pkt) == cache->size) {
		/* Assign buffer back to input packet. */
		pkt->buffer = cache->pkt->buffer;
		cache->pkt->buffer = NULL;

		fragment_reconstruct_packet(pkt);

		...

		// Assume a valid pkt, and thus pkt->buffer to be properly initialized
	}

```

In the following, `net_6lo_uncompress` is called, in which `pkt->buffer` is used and a crash occurs:

```
bool net_6lo_uncompress(struct net_pkt *pkt)
{
	NET_ASSERT(pkt && pkt->frags);

	if ((pkt->frags->data[0] & NET_6LO_DISPATCH_IPHC_MASK) ==
	    NET_6LO_DISPATCH_IPHC) {
			// BUG CRASH TRIGGER: pkt->frags->data[0] crashes, as
			// pkt->frags==NULL (pkt->frags is an alternative name for pkt->buffer)
			...
	}

```
## Proposed Fix

* Add check to reassembly logic for the packet which is added also being the first one
* Note that single-frame fragmentation may not be adhering to a specification, so dropping the packet may be an option as well

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
