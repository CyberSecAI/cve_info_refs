Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-3271

**Description:** The provided content details a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Pressbooks versions 5.17.3 and earlier.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input, specifically within the "long description" field of book information.
- The application allows HTML entities to be reflected onto the page without encoding or filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the "long description" field and stored in the database. When a user views the book's published page or previews the document, the malicious script is executed in their browser.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The system doesn't validate user inputs to remove or encode potentially harmful HTML tags or scripts

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** An attacker can potentially obtain a victim's session cookie using JavaScript, which can be used to hijack the user's session.
- **Credential Theft:** By cloning the application's login page within the malicious HTML file, an attacker can trick users into entering their credentials, leading to account compromise.
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Link/Preview:** An attacker tricks a user into clicking a malicious link or previews a document containing the malicious code.
- **Stored XSS via "long description" field:** The attacker injects malicious HTML/JavaScript code into the "long description" field of book information

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Account Creation:** The attacker needs to create an account on the Pressbooks platform.
- **Basic JavaScript Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML to craft the malicious payload.
- **Access to Book Editing:** The attacker needs to access book editing functionality in order to modify the "long description" field.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by GoSecure and a proof of concept was developed.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Pressbooks version 5.18.0, released in late January 2021. The fix includes sanitizing the input using Htmlawed to filter and sanitize the input values
- The vulnerability was addressed by a pull request that was merged into the dev branch of the main Pressbooks repository which uses Htmlawed to sanitize user inputs
