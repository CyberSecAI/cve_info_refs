- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper control of user-controlled file paths. Specifically, the Cortex XDR agent on Windows is vulnerable to a local privilege escalation due to a weakness related to how it handles user-controlled files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427). The agent does not properly validate or restrict the location where it loads files, allowing an attacker to influence the agent's behavior by placing a malicious file in a location where the agent will pick it up.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a local authenticated Windows user to execute programs with SYSTEM privileges, leading to complete compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access. An attacker must be able to log into the system with a valid local user account.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local authenticated user on a Windows system with a vulnerable Cortex XDR agent. They also need the ability to create files in the Windows root directory or manipulate key registry values.
