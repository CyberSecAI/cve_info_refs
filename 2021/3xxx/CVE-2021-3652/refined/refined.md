          "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of asterisk characters ('*') when used as password hashes. Instead of being treated as an invalid or disabled password, an asterisk allows any password to successfully authenticate.",
          "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper input validation, weak password hashing implementation. Specifically, the system fails to properly handle an asterisk as a password hash, leading to an authentication bypass.",
          "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to user accounts that were intended to be disabled by using an asterisk as their password hash. This can lead to complete compromise of the account and associated resources.",
          "Attack vectors": "Importing an asterisk as a password hash, either accidentally or maliciously, leads to successful authentication with any password. The attacker may achieve this via directory imports or direct modification of the password hashes.",
          "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to import user data or otherwise modify password hashes in the 389-ds-base directory. Access to the LDAP server and write privileges on the userPassword attribute would be necessary."

          "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability occurs due to improper handling of an asterisk character ('*') when it is used as a password hash. Instead of being treated as an invalid or disabled password, the asterisk allows any password to authenticate successfully.",
          "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The system's password authentication mechanism does not correctly handle the asterisk character in the password hash field. It allows authentication despite the presence of the asterisk, which should indicate a disabled password.",
          "Impact of exploitation": "By importing an asterisk as the password hash, an attacker can successfully authenticate to accounts that should be disabled, leading to unauthorized access to the system and its resources.",
          "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when an asterisk is used in the password hash. An attacker can exploit this by deliberately creating or modifying user accounts with an asterisk as the password hash, or by importing a dataset with such invalid entries.",
           "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would require the ability to create or modify user entries, which usually involves administrative access to the LDAP server. "

        "vulnerability_details": {
          "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause is the incorrect handling of an asterisk (*) as a crypted password hash. Specifically, when a user entry's password hash is set to \"{CRYPT}*\", any password can successfully bind to that entry. This occurs because the crypt_r algorithm's result is compared incorrectly when the dbpwd hash is too short.",
          "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary weakness lies in the `crypt_r` function misuse and the subsequent comparison using `ct_memcmp`. The system incorrectly compares only the salt part of the password, instead of the whole hash, when a short hash string like '*' is imported.",
          "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker who can import an entry with an asterisk as the crypted password hash can successfully bind (login) with any arbitrary password for that user, effectively bypassing the password protection. This allows unauthorized access to the user account and associated resources.",
          "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves setting the `userPassword` attribute of an entry to a value where the crypted hash is an asterisk ('*'), which can be done during import of an LDIF file or other user management operations.",
          "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires the ability to modify user entries, which is typically an administrative or privileged operation."
