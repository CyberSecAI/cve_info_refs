    "summary": "The document is related to CVE-2021-3450. It provides details about a vulnerability in OpenSSL's X.509 certificate handling, specifically with the `X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT` flag, which can lead to a CA certificate check bypass. Additionally, it includes a vulnerability regarding a NULL pointer dereference in signature_algorithms processing, and multiple other CVEs related to multiple oracle products.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause is an error in the implementation of the strict certificate check with X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag and NULL pointer dereference in signature_algorithms processing using TLSv1.2.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Bypass of CA certificate validation.",
        "Potential NULL pointer dereference leading to denial of service."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to a bypass of CA certificate checks, potentially allowing non-CA certificates to issue other certificates and a crash leading to a denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "Network-based attacks, where a malicious party can craft malicious certificates to impersonate a legit service.",
          "Maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello messages to cause a NULL pointer dereference in server."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": [
        "Ability to craft a malformed certificate chain.",
        "Ability to send TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello messages with specific extensions."
      ],
       "additional_details": "The advisory indicates that this vulnerability applies to Java deployments that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. It can also be exploited by supplying untrusted data to APIs in the specified component."
