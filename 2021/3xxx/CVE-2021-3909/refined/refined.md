Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-3909

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from OctoRPKI not imposing a limit on the duration of a connection. This lack of limitation enables a slowloris denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Specifically, when OctoRPKI sends HTTP requests to a repository, the connection is kept open indefinitely (for example, a day) while the server sends small amounts of data to maintain the connection. This causes OctoRPKI to wait indefinitely, effectively hanging the service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unbounded connection duration: The primary vulnerability is the absence of a timeout or limit on the length of HTTP connections. This allows an attacker to keep connections open indefinitely.
- Lack of resource management: The service does not properly manage resources associated with the open connections, allowing attackers to exhaust them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): The primary impact is that OctoRPKI becomes unresponsive, effectively denying service to legitimate users.
- Resource exhaustion: The continuous open connections can lead to resource exhaustion on the server hosting OctoRPKI.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The attack is conducted over the network by sending HTTP requests to the vulnerable OctoRPKI instance.
- Slowloris Attack: The attack specifically uses the slowloris technique where the attacker opens multiple connections to the server and keeps them alive by sending partial requests slowly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker must be able to send network requests to the OctoRPKI server.
- No special privileges: The attack does not require any specific access or privileges on the OctoRPKI server other than network connectivity.
- High attack complexity: Although network access is necessary, the attack complexity is still considered High, likely due to the need for specialized tools or scripts to effectively execute the slowloris attack.
- User interaction: No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.
