- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Network PAN-OS web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected XSS.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker can craft a malicious link that, when clicked by another authenticated PAN-OS administrator, executes arbitrary actions in the PAN-OS web interface with the privileges of the victim user. This could result in full control of the PAN-OS system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is network-based, utilizing a specially crafted link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have authenticated access to the PAN-OS web interface. The attacker also needs to trick another authenticated user to click the specially crafted link.
