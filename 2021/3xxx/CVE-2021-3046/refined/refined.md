- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authentication in PAN-OS software when using SAML authentication for GlobalProtect Portal and Gateway.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper authentication (CWE-287) allows an attacker to bypass proper authentication mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with SAML authentication can impersonate any other user in the GlobalProtect Portal and GlobalProtect Gateway. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive resources and data, as well as tampering with configurations.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have valid SAML authentication credentials. The attack complexity is high. An attacker with low privileges is required.
