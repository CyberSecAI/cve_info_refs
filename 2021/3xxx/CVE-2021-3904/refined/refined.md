Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2021-3904:

**Summary:**
The provided content includes a commit that addresses an XSS detection issue in Grav CMS. This commit is associated with fixing a vulnerability where the character `&colon;` was not being correctly handled during XSS detection.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability was caused by the `detectXss` function in `system/src/Grav/Common/Security.php` not properly considering the HTML entity `&colon;` when decoding strings. This could lead to bypassing XSS detection mechanisms.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient XSS Filtering:** The `detectXss` function was not correctly handling `&colon;`, an HTML entity for a colon (:), leading to a bypass of the intended XSS prevention.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application via a carefully crafted input string containing `&colon;` that would bypass the existing XSS filters. If successfully injected, this code would run in the browsers of other users of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Input Manipulation:** An attacker would need to find an input field or parameter within the Grav application that was not properly sanitized, allowing them to inject a string containing `&colon;` within malicious code (e.g., `<img src="x" onerror=alert(1)>`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the application. 
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious input that includes the `&colon;` entity in a way that it can be decoded to a harmful character or sequence of characters, and bypass the XSS filters.

**Technical details:**
- The commit `afc69a3229bb6fe120b2c1ea27bc6f196ed7284d` modifies `system/src/Grav/Common/Security.php` and adds  `&colon;` handling to the XSS detection process.
- The change can be seen in the diff for `system/src/Grav/Common/Security.php`, specifically line 203: the change is not detailed in the diff, but according to the description in CHANGELOG.md, this commit fixed XSS detection with `&colon;`.
- The vulnerability fix was included in version `1.7.23` according to `CHANGELOG.md` file.
