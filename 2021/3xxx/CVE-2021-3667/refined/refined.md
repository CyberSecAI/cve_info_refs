Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information regarding CVE-2021-3667:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies in an improper locking mechanism within the `virStoragePoolLookupByTargetPath` API function of libvirt. Specifically, when a locked `virStoragePoolObj` object was not properly released when an ACL permission check failed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Locking:** The `storagePoolLookupByTargetPath` function does not correctly release a locked object (`virStoragePoolObj`) when ACL permissions fail. This can cause a lock contention issue.
*   **ACL Permission Bypass:** This specific locking issue can be triggered by clients connecting to the libvirt read-write socket with limited ACL permissions. This means a user with limited access can cause a denial of service.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could acquire a lock on the object, preventing other users from accessing storage pool/volume APIs, leading to a denial of service condition.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:**  The vulnerability can be exploited over the network by clients connecting to the libvirt socket when configured for remote access over TCP and using polkit for access control.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have authenticated access to the libvirt socket, with limited ACL permissions.
*   **Network Access (optional):** Exploitation can occur over a network if the libvirt socket is enabled for remote access over TCP (along with polkit access control).
