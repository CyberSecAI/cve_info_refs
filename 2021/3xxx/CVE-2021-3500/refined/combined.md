Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 33 on 2021-11-30. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '33'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 33 is end of life.

Debian Bug     : 945114 988215

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in djvulibre, a library and
set of tools to handle documents in the DjVu format. An attacker could
crash document viewers and possibly execute arbitrary code through
crafted DjVu files.

For the oldstable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.5.27.1-10+deb10u1.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.28-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your djvulibre packages.

For the detailed security status of djvulibre please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/djvulibre>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 33 on 2021-11-30. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '33'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 33 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1943408#c4)  Ben Cotton    2021-11-04 14:32:16 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 33 is nearing its end of life.

Yes, I think that we should check this because of the division.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1943409#c4)  1vanChen    2021-04-23 16:04:33 UTC  ``` > Hi, could you try whether including <stdint.h> instead of <cstdint> fixes > the issue?

Thanks, Gianluca   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1943685#c4)  Marek Kašík    2021-05-04 17:11:58 UTC  ``` Hi,  I've just pushed an update which among others fixes this issue as well.  The issue here is that djvulibre tries to open a file inside a djvu file while already opening it and this goes on and on resulting in stack overflow. I've broken this cycle by remembering which file it is opening. I've stored the name in DjVuPortcaster class since it is common to these actions.  I'm not aware of an upstream fix for this.

The issue is that djvulibre tries to open a file inside the djvu file while already opening it and this goes on and on. I've broken this cycle by remembering which file it is opening. I've stored the name in DjVuPortcaster class since it is common to these actions.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1943411#c3)  1vanChen    2021-04-11 12:55:44 UTC  ``` (In reply to Marek Kašík from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1943411#c2)) > Created [attachment 1770188](attachment.cgi?id=1770188&action=diff "Patch fixing the stack overflow") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1770188&action=edit "Patch fixing the stack overflow") > Patch fixing the stack overflow >  > Thank you for reporting this bug! >  > The issue is that djvulibre tries to open a file inside the djvu file while > already opening it and this goes on and on. > I've broken this cycle by remembering which file it is opening.

Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 33 on 2021-11-30. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '33'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 33 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1943411#c5)  Ben Cotton    2021-11-04 14:31:31 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 33 is nearing its end of life.
