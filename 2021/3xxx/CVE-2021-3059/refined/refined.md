- **Root cause of vulnerability**: OS command injection vulnerability during dynamic updates in the PAN-OS management interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS Command Injection (CWE-78).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A man-in-the-middle attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands, potentially escalating privileges on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack. A man-in-the-middle attacker intercepts and modifies communications during dynamic updates.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be positioned to perform a man-in-the-middle attack between the PAN-OS device and the dynamic update server. The attacker requires no privileges and no user interaction. The complexity is rated as high.
