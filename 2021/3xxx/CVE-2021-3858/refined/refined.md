{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The commit modifies the application to use POST requests instead of GET requests for restore actions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure use of HTTP GET for actions that modify data. Previously, the application was using GET requests for actions that should be performed using POST requests."
    ],
    "impact": "The change aims to prevent potential CSRF attacks and improve overall security posture by ensuring actions with side effects are performed using POST requests.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "CSRF attacks: An attacker could potentially trick a user into performing actions using a crafted link. If the restore action is a GET request, the attacker can embed it in an image tag, or similar.",
        "Browser caching: GET requests are commonly cached by browsers. If the restore action is a GET request it could be replayed unintentionally."
    ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that performs the unintended action, as well as trick the user into visiting the link while they have an active session with the application."
