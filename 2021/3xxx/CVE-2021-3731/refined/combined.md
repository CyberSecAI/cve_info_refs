# Security advisory for CVE-2021-3731 (Clickjacking)

Submitted by ehu
on Fri, 08/20/2021 - 14:22

# Insufficient protection against 'clickjacking'

## Summary

LedgerSMB does not sufficiently guard against being wrapped by

Â  other sites, making it vulnerable to 'clickjacking. This allows

Â  an attacker to trick a targetted user to execute unintended actions.

## Known vulnerable

All of:

- 1.1.0 upto 1.1.12 (including)

Â  - 1.2.0 upto 1.2.26 (including)

Â  - 1.3.0 upto 1.3.47 (including)

Â  - 1.4.0 upto 1.4.42 (including)

Â  - 1.5.0 upto 1.5.30 (including)

Â  - 1.6.0 upto 1.6.33 (including)

Â  - 1.7.0 upto 1.7.32 (including)

Â  - 1.8.0 upto 1.8.17 (including)

## Known fixed

- 1.7.33

Â  - 1.8.18

## Details

In a clickjacking attack, an attacker (invisibly) wraps the vulnerable

Â  site in his own site, carefully placing elements of his own site over

Â  elements of the wrapped site, tricking the user into performing unintended

Â  actions on the vulnerable site. More information on clickjacking is on the

Â  OWASP page at https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Clickjacking

The lack of protection dates back to version 1.0, although it must

Â  be noted that mitigation measures were first available in browsers

Â  as of 2011 -- the year of the release of 1.3.0.

## Severity

CVSSv3.1 Base Score: 5.9 (Medium)

CVSSv3.1 Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N

## Recommendations

We recommend all users to upgrade to known-fixed versions. Versions prior

Â  to 1.7 are end-of-life and will not receive security fixes from the

Â  LedgerSMB project.

Users who cannot upgrade, may apply the included patches or are advised

Â  to contact a vendor for custom support.

As a workaround, administrators may configure their webservers to add

Â  the Content-Security-Policy header as documented in the content

Â  security policy site at https://content-security-policy.com/#server.
