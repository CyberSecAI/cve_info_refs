Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability fixed by commit `f80178b`:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an insecure direct object reference (IDOR) in the `delete` function of the `AvailableBudgetController`. Initially, the `delete` function expected an `AvailableBudget` model instance as a parameter. However, it was modified to accept a `Request` object instead. The code then attempts to retrieve the ID of the `AvailableBudget` via the request and then find the corresponding `AvailableBudget` object via the repository. This change allows a user to delete any `AvailableBudget` object by providing a valid ID, regardless of whether they own it or have permission to delete it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application directly uses user-provided input (the `id` parameter) to access and delete `AvailableBudget` objects without proper authorization checks.
*   **Missing authorization check:** The code does not verify if the currently authenticated user has the permission to delete the `AvailableBudget` object.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could delete any `AvailableBudget` object belonging to other users, leading to data loss and disruption of the application's functionality.
*   Potentially disrupt user's financial planning and tracking within the application.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Direct manipulation of HTTP requests:** An attacker could craft a POST request to the `/available-budgets/delete` endpoint and include the `id` parameter with the identifier of the `AvailableBudget` they wish to delete.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a registered user of the Firefly III application.
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of or be able to guess or enumerate valid `AvailableBudget` IDs of other users.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The commit message references a Huntr bounty, suggesting the vulnerability was reported via that platform: `Fix <https://huntr.dev/bounties/ea181323-51f8-46a2-a60f-6a401907feb7/>`
*   The fix involves using the request parameter to look up the AvailableBudget object rather than using the route parameter.
*   The commit diff shows the change from expecting the `AvailableBudget` model as parameter to retrieving it by `id` from the `Request` object.

This analysis provides more detail than the typical CVE description, outlining the specific code changes and the nature of the IDOR vulnerability.
