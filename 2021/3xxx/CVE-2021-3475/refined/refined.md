Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-3475:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow in the `Imf_2_5::calculateNumTiles` function within the OpenEXR library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The `calculateNumTiles` function, when processing certain image sizes, could calculate an incorrect number of tiles due to an integer overflow. Specifically, if the calculated level size is close to `MAX_INT`, subsequent calculations would cause an overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The integer overflow could lead to a crash of the application processing the malformed image file.  It is mentioned as a potential availability problem in one of the reports.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Image File:** An attacker can craft a malicious OpenEXR image file with specific dimensions that triggers the integer overflow in `calculateNumTiles`.
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing the crafted image file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply or have processed a crafted, malicious OpenEXR file by an application that utilizes the vulnerable OpenEXR library.

**Technical Details:**

- The issue arises in the `ImfTiledMisc.cpp` file.
- The original code used an integer type that could overflow when calculating the size of a level.
- The fix involves using a 64-bit integer type (`Int64`) to perform the `levelSize()` calculation, thus preventing the overflow.
- The corrected calculation is `numTiles[i] = (l + size - 1) / size;` where `l` is the 64 bit level size.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in OpenEXR versions 2.5.4, 2.5.5, and 3.0.1+.
- Red Hat marked this bug as "WONTFIX" in their bug tracker, as it was fixed in newer releases.
- Debian LTS issued security advisories (DLA-2701-1 and DLA 3236-1) to address this issue, along with other CVEs affecting openexr.
