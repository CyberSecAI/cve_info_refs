| Prerequisites  * [Y ] I have written a descriptive issue title * [Y] I have verified that I am using the latest version of ImageMagick * [Y] I have searched [open](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues) and [closed](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) issues to ensure it has not already been reported.  Description There is a segmentation fault caused by the NPD in function ReadSVGImage, svg.c:3621 in ImageMagick 7.0.10. ImageMagick does not check the nullity of the pointer returned from libxml2 and dereference it directly. This directly leads to program crashes and segmentation fault. Steps to Reproduce 1, To ensure reproduce, I use up space in the /tmp folder as a low-level privilege user. For example, to facilitate the reproducation,  ``` fallocate -l size_of_the_tmp_folder /tmp/test.img  ```  2, Run:  ``` magick convert poc ./test.ps  ```  [seg-svg3621.zip](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/files/5280857/seg-svg3621.zip) (unzip first)  Here is the trace reported by ASAN:  ``` ASAN:SIGSEGV ================================================================= ==112350==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address 0x000000000010 (pc 0x0000009fec8c bp 0x62700001f900 sp 0x7ffd383e31c0 T0)     #0 0x9fec8b in ReadSVGImage ../coders/svg.c:3621     #1 0xc8ba0c in ReadImage ../MagickCore/constitute.c:553     #2 0x8dfbc1 in ReadPESImage ../coders/pes.c:673     #3 0xc8ba0c in ReadImage ../MagickCore/constitute.c:553     #4 0xc8ecbc in ReadImages ../MagickCore/constitute.c:943     #5 0x12bfaef in ConvertImageCommand ../MagickWand/convert.c:607     #6 0x13fd865 in MagickCommandGenesis ../MagickWand/mogrify.c:191     #7 0x43992d in MagickMain ../utilities/magick.c:149     #8 0x7efd17fa982f in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x2082f)     #9 0x439168 in _start (/mnt/data/playground/ImageMagick/build-asan/utilities/magick+0x439168)  AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.

Debian Bug     : 1027164 1030767

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in imagemagick that may
lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information leaks.

CVE-2020-19667

    A stack-based buffer overflow and unconditional jump was found in
    ReadXPMImage in coders/xpm.c

    allow an out-of-bounds READ via heap-buffer-overflow in
    WriteOnePNGImage from coders/png.c

CVE-2020-25675

    A undefined behavior was found in the form of integer overflow
    and out-of-range values as a result of rounding calculations
    performed on unconstrained pixel offsets in the CropImage()
    and CropImageToTiles() routines of MagickCore/transform.c

CVE-2020-25676

    A undefined behavior was found in the form of integer overflow
    and out-of-range values as a result of rounding calculations

    cases caused a value outside the range of type `int` to be
    returned.

CVE-2020-27760

    In `GammaImage()` of /MagickCore/enhance.c, depending
    on the `gamma` value, it's possible to trigger a
    divide-by-zero condition when a crafted input file
    is processed.

CVE-2020-27761

    WritePALMImage() in /coders/palm.c used size_t casts
    in several areas of a calculation which could lead to
    values outside the range of representable type `unsigned long`
    undefined behavior when a crafted input file was processed.

CVE-2020-27762

    Undefined behavior was found in the form of values outside the
    range of type `unsigned char` in coders/hdr.c

CVE-2020-27763

    Undefined behavior was found in the form of math division by
    zero in MagickCore/resize.c

CVE-2020-27764

    Out-of-range values was found under some
    circumstances when a crafted input file is processed in
    /MagickCore/statistic.c

CVE-2020-27765

    Undefined behavior was found in the form of math division by
    zero in MagickCore/segment.c when a crafted file is processed

CVE-2020-27766

    A crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger
    undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of
    type `unsigned long`

    Undefined behavior was found in the form of values outside the
    range of types `float` and `unsigned char` in MagickCore/quantum.h

    An outside the range of representable values of type
    `unsigned int` was found in MagickCore/quantum-private.h

CVE-2020-27769

    An outside the range of representable values of type
    `float` was found in MagickCore/quantize.c

CVE-2020-27770

    Due to a missing check for 0 value of
    `replace_extent`, it is possible for offset `p` to overflow in
    SubstituteString()

CVE-2020-27771

    In RestoreMSCWarning() of /coders/pdf.c there are
    several areas where calls to GetPixelIndex() could result in values
    outside the range of representable for the `unsigned char` type

CVE-2020-27772

    Undefined behavior was found in the form of values outside the
    range of type `unsigned int` in coders/bmp.c

CVE-2020-27775

    Undefined behavior was found in the form of values outside the
    range of type `unsigned char` in MagickCore/quantum.h

CVE-2020-27776

    A crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger
    undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of
    type unsigned long.

CVE-2020-29599

    ImageMagick mishandles the -authenticate option, which
    allows setting a password for password-protected PDF files.
    The user-controlled password was not properly escaped/sanitized
    and it was therefore possible to inject additional
    shell commands via coders/pdf.c.
    On debian system, by default the imagemagick policy
    mitigated this CVE.

CVE-2021-3574

    A memory leak was found converting a crafted TIFF file.

CVE-2021-3596

    A NULL pointer dereference was found in ReadSVGImage() in
    coders/svg.c

CVE-2021-20224

    An integer overflow issue was discovered in ImageMagick's
    ExportIndexQuantum() function in MagickCore/quantum-export.c.

CVE-2022-44267

    A Denial of Service was found. When it parses a PNG image,
    the convert process could be left waiting for stdin input.

CVE-2022-44268

    An Information Disclosure was found. When it parses a PNG image,
    (e.g., for resize), the resulting image could have embedded
    the content of an arbitrary. file.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
8:6.9.10.23+dfsg-2.1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.

Package        : imagemagick
Version        : 8:6.9.7.4+dfsg-11+deb9u14
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-3596 CVE-2022-28463

CVE-2021-3596

    A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in
    ImageMagick in versions prior to 7.0.10-31 in ReadSVGImage() in
    coders/svg.c. This issue is due to not checking the return value from
    libxml2's xmlCreatePushParserCtxt() and uses the value directly, which
    leads to a crash and segmentation fault.

CVE-2022-28463

    ImageMagick is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
8:6.9.7.4+dfsg-11+deb9u14.

We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.
