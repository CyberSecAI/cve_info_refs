Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-3014

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization on the `target` parameter within the MikroTik hotspot login page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code through the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The `target` parameter's value is directly inserted into the HTML source of the login page without proper encoding or sanitization.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate or sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it back to the user. Specifically, the application does not prevent the injection of HTML attributes like `onSubmit`, which can trigger arbitrary JavaScript code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the login page, which executes within the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Account Takeover/Information Theft:** By exploiting the XSS vulnerability, an attacker could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or even gain control over the victim's MikroTik user session. Attackers could use this to obtain admin credentials or other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `target` parameter.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to trick a victim into clicking on the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be on the same network as the victim, as this is a MikroTik hotspot login page vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to distribute the malicious URL, typically by tricking the user into clicking a crafted link.

**Technical Details:**
*   The `target` parameter in the login page is reflected in an `<input>` tag with the value attribute.
*   The application does not sanitize user input, which allows for the injection of HTML attributes.
*   By injecting an attribute like `onSubmit` within the `target` parameter, the attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript when the user submits the login form.
