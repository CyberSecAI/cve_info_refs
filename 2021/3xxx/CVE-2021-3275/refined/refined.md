  "response": {
    "root_cause": "Improper validation of the hostname of wireless client devices connected to TP-Link devices.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The hostname value is only validated for ASCII characters, while there is no validation for Non-ASCII characters.",
      "The vulnerable hostname function `setDefaultHostname()` is used without sanitization in multiple pages.",
	  "The hostname value is pushed to an array as plain text along with IP and MAC addresses."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can execute unauthenticated malicious scripts (stored XSS) on the TP-Link device's web interface.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious XSS payload is injected into the hostname of a wireless client device. When the TP-Link device's web interface is accessed, specifically pages displaying client hostnames such as DHCP settings or the wireless client table, the malicious script is executed. The payload is triggered when the device requests client data via the `LAN_HOST_ENTRY` operation.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to set a custom hostname on a wireless client device connected to the vulnerable TP-Link router. The attacker does not need to authenticate to the router's web interface to trigger the vulnerability."
