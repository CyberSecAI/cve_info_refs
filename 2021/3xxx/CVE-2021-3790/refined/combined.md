**Mitigation Strategy for Customers (what you should do to protect yourself):**

Update to the camera firmware version (or newer version) indicated in the Product Impact section below.

If you are concerned about these issues, you can use your camera in an “offline” mode until fixes are released by following these steps:

* Go to the camera app, Hubble Connected for Motorola
* Under your camera setting, there will be a “Delete camera” option
* Delete the camera from the app
* If your camera comes with a handheld monitor, you can view the camera on it
