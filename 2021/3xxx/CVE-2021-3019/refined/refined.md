The provided content relates to CVE-2021-3019.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a path traversal issue in lanproxy.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application is vulnerable to path traversal, which allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server, including configuration files (`config.properties`) and sensitive system files like `/etc/shadow`. This could lead to information disclosure and further compromise of the system, such as gaining access to the intranet by configuring the proxy.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the lanproxy server with a path traversal sequence (`../`) in the URL. For example: `http://192.168.5.43:8090/../conf/config.properties`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable lanproxy server. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker can then read configuration files and potentially gain access to the internal network by configuring the proxy.
