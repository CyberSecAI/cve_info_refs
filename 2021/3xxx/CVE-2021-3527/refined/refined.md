      "content": "The provided content is related to CVE-2021-3527. Here's the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from an unbounded stack allocation within the USB redirector device (usb-redir) in QEMU. Specifically, when small USB packets are combined into a larger transfer request to improve performance, the combined size of the bulk transfer is used to dynamically allocate a variable length array (VLA) on the stack. This allocation lacks proper size validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Unbounded stack allocation.\n- Lack of validation of the combined size of bulk transfers leading to uncontrolled VLA allocation.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Denial of service (DoS). A malicious guest can manipulate the array length by sending crafted USB packets, causing an excessive allocation on the stack, which leads to QEMU process crash.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- A malicious guest can send crafted USB packets.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- Ability to control/manipulate the virtual guest's USB traffic.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The vulnerability is located in the `usbredir_handle_bulk_data()` function.\n- The fix includes limiting the combined packet size to 1MiB, and avoiding dynamic stack allocation by using heap allocation instead in `usb/redir`, `usb/hid`, and `usb/mtp`."
