**Bulletin ID:** HCSEC-2021-06

**Affected Products / Versions:** Terraform Enterprise, fixed in release v202103-1.

**Publication Date:** 23 March, 2021

**Summary**

Terraform Enterprise did not enforce the organization-level setting to require all users within an organization to enable two-factor authentication. This vulnerability, CVE-2021-3153, was fixed in Terraform Enterprise v202103-1.

**Background**

Terraform Enterprise [organizations](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/users-teams-organizations/organizations.html) are a shared space for teams to collaborate on workspaces in. Organization owners may configure their organization to require all members to enable [two-factor authentication](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/users-teams-organizations/2fa.html).

**Details**

It was discovered that Terraform Enterprise did not enforce the organization-level setting which required all users within an organization to enable two-factor authentication. It was possible for individual users to be added to an organization without having two-factor authentication, even when that organization-level setting was enabled.

*Note that the two-factor authentication mechanism itself was not affected by this vulnerability, has been tested, and remains effective.*

**Remediation**

Terraform Enterprise customers should evaluate the risk associated with this issue and consider upgrading to v202103-1 or newer.

**Acknowledgement**

This issue was identified by the team at Mox Bank, who reported it to HashiCorp.
