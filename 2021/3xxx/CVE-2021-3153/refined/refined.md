- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Terraform Enterprise did not enforce the organization-level setting requiring all users within an organization to enable two-factor authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability is a failure to enforce the organization-level setting for two-factor authentication, allowing users to be added to an organization without enabling it, even when the setting is enabled.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Users could be added to organizations without having 2FA enabled, bypassing the security control intended to protect the organization's resources.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could potentially add a user to an organization without requiring 2FA. The specific method of user addition isn't detailed in the provided text.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker would need to have the ability to add users to an organization, bypassing the intended 2FA enforcement.
