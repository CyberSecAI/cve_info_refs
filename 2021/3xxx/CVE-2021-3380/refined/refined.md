Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** The provided content does not explicitly mention CVE-2021-3380. However, it describes a vulnerability that could potentially be assigned a CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

    - User details
    - Addresses
    - Payment information
