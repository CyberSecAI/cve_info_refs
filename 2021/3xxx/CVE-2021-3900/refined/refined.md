Based on the provided content, this commit addresses Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities within the Firefly III application, specifically related to rule and rule group management.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application was previously using GET requests to perform actions like duplicating rules and moving rule groups which are state changing operations that should be performed via POST requests. This lack of CSRF protection made the application vulnerable to CSRF attacks because the user's browser automatically includes session cookies in GET requests, allowing an attacker to induce authenticated users to perform unwanted actions by visiting a malicious page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability when duplicating a rule via GET request.
- CSRF vulnerability when moving a rule group (up/down) via GET request.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially:
- Duplicate rules without the user's consent.
- Manipulate the order of rule groups, disrupting the intended rule application logic.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a malicious website or link controlled by the attacker, which sends a crafted GET request to the vulnerable application on behalf of an authenticated user.
- The attacker needs to induce the victim to visit the malicious link/site.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to know the structure of the URLs used to move rule groups and duplicate rules.
- The attacker would need to entice a user who is logged into the Firefly III application to visit a crafted malicious link or page.

**Technical details:**

The commit modifies the following files:

-   `app/Http/Controllers/Rule/CreateController.php`:
    - The `duplicate` method now handles the duplication of rules by POST request.
-   `app/Http/Controllers/RuleGroup/EditController.php`:
    -   The `down` and `up` methods are removed. A new `moveGroup` method is introduced to handle the moving of rule groups up and down using POST requests.
-   `app/Repositories/RuleGroup/RuleGroupRepository.php`: Minor changes with respect to the query logic.
-   `public/v1/js/ff/rules/index.js`:
    -   Added `moveRuleGroup` and `duplicateRule` functions to send the POST requests with the required CSRF token.
    -   Click event listeners are added to trigger `moveRuleGroup` and `duplicateRule` functions.
-   `resources/views/v1/rules/index.twig`:
    -   The links for moving rule groups up and down, and duplicating rules are now handled by JavaScript functions which use POST request.
    -   Javascript variables `moveRuleGroupUrl` and `duplicateRuleUrl` are defined to make requests.
-   `routes/web.php`:
    - The `duplicate` route for rules is updated to use POST request
    - The `up` and `down` routes for rule groups are removed.
    - The `move` route is added for rule groups with POST method.

This commit is addressing CSRF vulnerability by ensuring that state-changing actions are performed using POST requests along with CSRF tokens, rather than GET requests.
