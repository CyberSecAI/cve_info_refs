Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-3272:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer over-read within the `jp2_decode` function in `jp2_dec.c` of the JasPer library. This occurs due to an inconsistent relationship between the number of channels and the number of image components in a malformed JP2 file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer over-read (CWE-125) in `jp2_decode` function.
- The vulnerability exists when processing a specially crafted JP2 image file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  The over-read can lead to a crash of the application using the JasPer library, due to an attempt to access memory outside the allocated buffer.
- Potentially, this could lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker can carefully craft the malicious JP2 file to overwrite memory regions in a controllable way.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the processing of a malicious JP2 image file.
- The attacker needs to supply the vulnerable application with a specially crafted JP2 file that triggers the inconsistent relationship between channels and components.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply the malformed JP2 file to an application using the vulnerable JasPer library.
- This could occur via a website that processes user-uploaded images or via a program that opens or processes images from an untrusted source.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was reported by Kaka201 of NSFOCUS Security Team.
- A patch was created and merged into the master branch of the JasPer repository.
- The vulnerability affects JasPer version 2.0.24
- Fedora updates have been released to address this vulnerability in versions 32 and 33 of the OS.
