{
  "CVE-2021-3594": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from an invalid pointer initialization in the SLiRP networking implementation's `udp_input()` function in QEMU. This occurs when processing a UDP packet smaller than the size of the 'udphdr' structure.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Invalid pointer initialization",
      "Out-of-bounds read access"
    ],
    "Impact": "This vulnerability may lead to out-of-bounds read access or indirect host memory disclosure to the guest, potentially leaking sensitive information.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious guest can send a crafted UDP packet that is smaller than expected.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a malicious guest user with the ability to send network traffic."
  }
