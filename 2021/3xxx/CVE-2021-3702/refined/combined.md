### @abadger **[abadger](/abadger)** commented [Jun 28, 2021](#issue-931956348)

Looking through the code, I found two separate race conditions with tempfile handling which can be exploited. One of those is mentioned in [#738](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner/issues/738). The other one happens because we create a tempdir and then delete it, then later reuse its name. An attacker can pre-create the tempdir in between the deletion and the second creation with the reused name. This PR attempts to fix both.

Fixes [#738](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner/issues/738)

Sorry, something went wrong.

* #### [When creating a private\_data\_dir in a world writable location, use mkdtemp()](/ansible/ansible-runner/pull/742/commits/60b059f00409224acae1e417153a241c8591ad89 "When creating a private_data_dir in a world writable location, use mkdtemp() The previous code allowed for an easily exploitable race where the attacker could pre-create a known directory name to gain access to private files created by ansible-runner. Using mkdtemp() closes that hole because mkdtemp() ensures that the directory name returned has been allocated with restrictive permissions by mkdtemp itself so the attacker has no opportunity to inject their own directory. Fixes #738")

This code fixes the issue by creating the directory securely using mkdtemp() and not deleting it afterwards.")

Close a race condition with temporary files

```
The previous code allowed a race where an attacker could watch for
creation of a rapid creation and deletion of a temporary directory,
substitute their own directory at that name, and then have access to
ansible-runner's private_data_dir the next time ansible-runner made
ues of the private_data_dir.

This code fixes the issue by creating the directory securely using
mkdtemp() and not deleting it afterwards.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1977965#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2021-06-30 19:51:37 UTC  ``` A race condition was found in ansible-runner where an attacker could watch for a rapid creation and deletion of a temporary directory, substitute their own directory at that name, and then have access to ansible-runner's private_data_dir the next time ansible-runner made use of the private_data_dir.  Upstream patch:  <https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner/pull/742/commits/0e9aa8a97e7832ef9a1553ef2908632a32d2b8c4>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1977965#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2021-06-30 19:52:23 UTC  ``` Created python-ansible-runner tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1977968](show_bug.cgi?id=1977968 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2021-3702 python-ansible-runner: ansible-runner: Race condition with temporary files in tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() [epel-7]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1977967](show_bug.cgi?id=1977967 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2021-3702 python-ansible-runner: ansible-runner: Race condition with temporary files in tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() [fedora-all]")] Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1977966](show_bug.cgi?id=1977966 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2021-3702 python-ansible-runner: ansible-runner: Race condition with temporary files in tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() [openstack-rdo]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1977965#c4)  Sage McTaggart    2021-07-02 20:50:49 UTC  ``` Red Hat Ceph Storage 4 does not ship the affected code, and has been marked not affected.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1977965#c5)  Mark Cooper    2021-07-05 07:40:54 UTC  ``` In OCP 4.7, version 1.4.6-2 is packaged and is too old to have the vulnerable code - uses the secure version of mkstemp: <https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner/blob/26a06567df037889f15e4b2eaa29919c6637986f/ansible_runner/utils.py#L151>  In OCP 3.11, version 1.2.0-1 is packaged and uses the secure version of make temp: <https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner/blob/94f58c7c3667102dbafbf3b2349322c594deeccc/ansible_runner/utils.py#L143>  Looks like the vulnerable code got refactored around version 2 <https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner/commit/93e95a3df9021a38010386d07df121392d249253>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1977965#c6)  Mark Cooper    2021-07-05 12:32:47 UTC  ``` Well in hindsight even if the above ^ aren't the refactor'ed, the older versions still don't contain the code to insecurely create a temp dir.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1977965#c8)  Tapas Jena    2021-08-11 17:34:43 UTC  ``` Analysis is complete for all the concerned Ansible components and it was found that AAP 1.2 and Ansible Tower are affected by this vulnerability. However, AAP 2.0 is "Not Affected" by this vulnerability as it ships ansible-runner 2.0.1 which already contains the fix for this issue.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1977965#c11)  Tapas Jena    2021-11-12 17:16:58 UTC  ``` This vulnerability was part of ansible_runner_2.0 but was fixed before it got published it.  It was fixed by this PR <https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner/pull/742> (the commits in that PR got back-port to release_2.0 before we went GA) This code wasn't part of 1.4 - so no released version of runner is actually impacted by this.  Finally, no any shipped ansible runner version from Red Hat has been facing the issue. Hence, though this was marked as "affected" initially, marking it back to "not affected" . However, since this is a valid vulnerability, the CVE will remain valid as well.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1977965#c12)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-11-12 17:27:15 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2021-3702>   ``` |  |
