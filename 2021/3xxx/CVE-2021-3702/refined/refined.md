          "data": "Looking through the code, I found two separate race conditions with tempfile handling which can be exploited. One of those is mentioned in [#738](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner/issues/738). The other one happens because we create a tempdir and then delete it, then later reuse its name. An attacker can pre-create the tempdir in between the deletion and the second creation with the reused name. This PR attempts to fix both.\n\nThe previous code allowed for an easily exploitable race where the attacker could pre-create a known directory name to gain access to private files created by ansible-runner. Using mkdtemp() closes that hole because mkdtemp() ensures that the directory name returned has been allocated with restrictive permissions by mkdtemp itself so the attacker has no opportunity to inject their own directory.\n\nThe previous code allowed a race where an attacker could watch for creation of a rapid creation and deletion of a temporary directory, substitute their own directory at that name, and then have access to ansible-runner's private_data_dir the next time ansible-runner made ues of the private_data_dir.\n\nThis code fixes the issue by creating the directory securely using mkdtemp() and not deleting it afterwards."

      "vulnerability_details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from two separate race conditions in the way `ansible-runner` handles temporary files and directories. One race condition is due to reusing a temporary directory name after deleting it, creating a window where an attacker can create a directory with the same name. The other is when creating private data directories in world-writable locations, the code didn't use `mkdtemp`, allowing an attacker to create a directory with a known name.",

          "Race condition vulnerabilities during temporary file and directory creation and deletion.",
          "Insecure temporary directory creation using predictable names."
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker could exploit these race conditions to gain access to `ansible-runner`'s private data directories, potentially leading to unauthorized access and modification of private files, affecting both integrity and confidentiality.",
        "attack_vectors": "An attacker would need to monitor the creation and deletion of temporary directories and then quickly create a directory with the same name before the application does. For the second race condition, an attacker would need to create a directory in a world-writable location before ansible-runner creates it.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the capability to monitor filesystem operations and create directories in the same location as ansible-runner's temporary directories. In the case of the second race condition, they would need to be able to create files and folders in world-writable locations where ansible-runner writes to."
