Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3548:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `dmg2img` tool, specifically within the `memcpy()` function in `dmg2img.c`.
- The tool does not properly validate the size of the read buffer when using `memcpy()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** The `memcpy()` operation can read beyond the allocated buffer due to insufficient size validation.
- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The heap buffer can overflow when the `memcpy()` copies more data than the destination buffer can hold.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Leak:** By crafting a malicious DMG image, an attacker can cause the tool to leak memory layout information within the `parts[i].Data` buffer.
- **Undefined Behavior:** The out-of-bounds read in the `memcpy()` leads to undefined program behavior, which can result in crashes.
- **Potential for Code Execution:** The memory leak could potentially be used as part of a vulnerability chain to achieve code execution by exposing memory layout details.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious DMG Image:** The primary attack vector involves providing the `dmg2img` tool with a specially crafted DMG image file.
- **Command-line execution:** The attacker would need to be able to run the vulnerable `dmg2img` command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted DMG image to the `dmg2img` command.
- The attacker must be able to execute the `dmg2img` program on the target system, so local access or the ability to provide the command to a system is required.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is located in the `main()` function of `dmg2img.c`.
- The vulnerable code snippet is: `memcpy(parts[i].Data, base64data + 0xCC, parts[i].BlocksRunCount * 0x28);`
- The `parts[i].BlocksRunCount` value is controlled by data in the malicious DMG image file, which allows an attacker to control the size of the `memcpy()` operation and cause an out-of-bounds read.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided github issue mentions a segmentation fault due to a heap-buffer-overflow.
- Red Hat Bugzilla indicates this CVE is for community support and does not directly affect any commercial Red Hat product.
