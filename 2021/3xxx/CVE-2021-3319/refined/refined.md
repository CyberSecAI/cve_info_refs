- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper processing of omitted source and destination addresses in IEEE 802.15.4 frame validation, specifically within the `ieee802154_validate_frame` function. When source/destination addresses are omitted or the packet is too short, NULL pointers are incorrectly handled, leading to a corrupted pointer being used in later processing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    -  Improper handling of NULL pointers during address validation in `ieee802154_validate_frame`.
    -  Lack of NULL pointer checks in `set_pkt_ll_addr`, leading to assignment of invalid pointer values.
    -  Use of corrupted pointer in `sys_mem_swap` within `ieee802154_manage_recv_packet`, causing unintended memory manipulation.
    - In MAC Command frames, usage of potentially NULL destination address during validation leads to a crash
-  **Impact of exploitation**:
    -  Denial of service (crash of firmware) due to invalid memory access.
    -  In some niche cases, potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the memory corruption can be manipulated to overwrite critical system data like the initial stack pointer and reset vector address.
-  **Attack vectors**:
    -  Sending specially crafted IEEE 802.15.4 frames with omitted or invalid source/destination addresses.
    -  Sending too short packets that trigger the vulnerability.
-  **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    -  Attacker needs to be able to send IEEE 802.15.4 frames to the vulnerable device.
    - No specific user interaction is required.
