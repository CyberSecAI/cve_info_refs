{
  "CVE-2021-3565": {
    "root_cause": "The `tpm2_import` tool used a fixed AES key for the inner wrapper when importing keys into the TPM.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of a hardcoded, predictable symmetric encryption key.",
       "Lack of proper randomness when generating keys."
    ],
    "impact": "A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacker could intercept and unwrap the imported key, compromising its confidentiality.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "MITM attack on the communication channel between the host and the TPM during key import."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to intercept the communication between the host and the TPM.",
      "Understanding of the tpm2_import protocol and inner wrapping."
    ],
       "additional_details": "Even using an encrypted session with the TPM would not prevent this vulnerability, as the TPM only encrypts the first parameter which is the fixed symmetric key. The fix involves ensuring the key size is 16 bytes or bigger and using OpenSSL to generate a secure random AES key."
