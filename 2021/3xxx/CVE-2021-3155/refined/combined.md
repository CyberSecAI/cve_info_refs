# USN-5292-1: snapd vulnerabilities

17 February 2022

Several security issues were fixed in snapd.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 21.10](/security/notices?release=impish)
* [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](/security/notices?release=focal)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [snapd](/security/cves?package=snapd) - Daemon and tooling that enable snap packages

## Details

James Troup discovered that snap did not properly manage the permissions for

the snap directories. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2021-3155](/security/CVE-2021-3155))

Ian Johnson discovered that snapd did not properly validate content interfaces

and layout paths. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to inject

arbitrary AppArmor policy rules, resulting in a bypass of intended access

restrictions. ([CVE-2021-4120](/security/CVE-2021-4120))

The Qualys Research Team discovered that snapd did not properly validate the

location of the snap-confine binary. A local attacker could possibly use this

issue to execute other arbitrary binaries and escalate privileges.

([CVE-2021-44730](/security/CVE-2021-44730))

The Qualys Research Team discovered that a race condition existed in the snapd

snap-confine binary when preparing a private mount namespace for a snap. A

local attacker could possibly use this issue to escalate privileges and

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2021-44731](/security/CVE-2021-44731))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 21.10

* [snap-confine](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd)
  -
  [2.54.3+21.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd/2.54.3%2B21.10.1)
* [snapd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd)
  -
  [2.54.3+21.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd/2.54.3%2B21.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 20.04

* [snap-confine](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd)
  -
  [2.54.3+20.04](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd/2.54.3%2B20.04)
* [snapd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd)
  -
  [2.54.3+20.04](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd/2.54.3%2B20.04)

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [snap-confine](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd)
  -
  [2.54.3+18.04](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd/2.54.3%2B18.04)
* [snapd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd)
  -
  [2.54.3+18.04](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd/2.54.3%2B18.04)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
