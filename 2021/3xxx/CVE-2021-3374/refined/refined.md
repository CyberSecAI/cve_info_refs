Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3374:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal flaw in RStudio Shiny Server versions prior to 1.5.16. The server fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Directory Traversal:  The primary weakness is the ability to use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `..%2F`) in the URL to access files outside the intended web root.
- Source Code Leakage: By traversing the directory structure, an attacker can access and download server-side source code and configuration files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Sensitive Information Disclosure: Attackers can access sensitive data, such as configuration files, potentially revealing secrets, credentials, or other private information.
-  Full Source Code Disclosure: The ability to download server-side code allows attackers to understand the application logic, facilitating further attacks.
- Complete Server Compromise: By leveraging the leaked source code and sensitive information, an attacker might gain full control over the server and its resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP Request Manipulation: The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests where encoded forward slashes (`%2F`) are used within URLs to bypass directory access restrictions.
- Direct URL Access: The attacker directly crafts a URL with the directory traversal sequences.
- Proxy: The vulnerability persists even when requests are proxied.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the server running a vulnerable version of RStudio Shiny Server.
- HTTP knowledge: The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests, using the browser or another client.
