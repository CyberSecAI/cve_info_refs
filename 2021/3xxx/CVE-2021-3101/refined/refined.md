{
  "CVE-2021-3101": {
    "Description": "Hotdog, prior to v1.0.1, did not mimic the capabilities or the SELinux label of the target JVM process. This would allow a container to gain full privileges on the host, bypassing restrictions set on the container.",
    "Root cause": "The hot patch solutions invoked container binaries without properly containerizing them, lacking the limitations normally applied to container processes (such as seccomp and cgroups). They also ran as root regardless of the container's user.",
     "Weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient containerization of processes.",
        "Lack of privilege dropping before execution.",
        "Inadequate isolation of hot patch processes.",
        "Failure to mimic capabilities or SELinux labels."
      ],
    "Impact": "A container could execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the host, leading to full system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": [
        "Malicious container images with a binary named \"java\".",
        "Compromised containers using the hot patch service to escalate privileges.",
        "Malicious unprivileged processes tricking the hot patch service to gain root access."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to deploy a malicious container or run a malicious unprivileged process on a host where the vulnerable hot patch solution is installed."
