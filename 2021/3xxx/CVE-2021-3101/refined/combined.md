Benefits

## Benefits

Open all

### Increased uptime for container applications

Updates to Bottlerocket are applied in a single step and can be rolled back if necessary, resulting in lower error rates and improved uptime for container applications. By contrast, general-purpose operating systems are typically updated package-by-package.

### Open-source development model enables custom builds

Bottlerocket’s open development model enables customers and partners to produce custom builds, for example, builds that support their preferred orchestrators. Changes in these custom builds can be contributed back for inclusion to the Bottlerocket open source project.

### Lower management overhead and operational costs

Updates to Bottlerocket can be automated using container orchestration services such as Amazon EKS, which lowers management overhead and reduces operational costs.

### Improved security and resource utilization

Bottlerocket includes only the essential software to run containers, which improves resource utilization and reduces the attack surface compared to general-purpose operating systems

### Optimized performance through AWS integrations

AWS provided builds of Bottlerocket are optimized to run on Amazon EC2 and include support for the latest Amazon EC2 instance capabilities. They also have built-in integrations with AWS services for container orchestration, registries, and observability.

### CIS hardening out of the box

Amazon Web Services’s Bottlerocket has been certified by the Center for Internet Security® (CIS®) to ship secure as hardened to CIS Bottlerocket Benchmark v1.0.0. Organizations that leverage Bottlerocket can now be assured that it will successfully run on a CIS hardened environment.

  ### Veeva Systems

  Veeva Systems is the leader in cloud-based software for the global life sciences industry. We run a variety of containerized microservices on a development cluster built entirely on Bottlerocket nodes. We adopted Bottlerocket because we wanted a streamlined container OS with better resource efficiency, enhanced security, and reduced management overhead. The transition to Bottlerocket was a seamless experience and it has largely been a drop-in replacement for our other EKS nodes.

  ### GetYourGuide

  GetYourGuide is the booking platform for unforgettable travel experiences. Travelers use GetYourGuide to discover the best things to do at a destination — including walking tours by top local experts, local culinary tours, cooking and craft classes, skip-the-line tickets to the world’s most iconic attractions, bucket-list experiences and niche offerings you won’t usually find anywhere else. We chose Bottlerocket as the operating system for our Kubernetes clusters because it reduces node maintenance costs for us and improves our application security. Bottlerocket integrates seamlessly with EKS and the declarative approach to configure instances at startup ensures our node groups run with high reliability and consistency.

  ### Swisscom

  Swisscom is Switzerland's leading telecoms company and one of its leading IT companies. The vast majority of the workloads we run in the cloud are containerized and we have been promoting a Bottlerocket-first strategy for our Kubernetes clusters since the early stages of our AWS journey.

  Today, all our EKS worker nodes are powered by Bottlerocket OS. We adopted Bottlerocket because it is engineered to do one thing right: run containers. Run containers securely, thanks to a variety of built-in controls that create a secure environment for our applications. Run containers more efficiently by including only the essential runtime software and thus improving the overall instance resource utilization. Run containers for a very long time, being an opensource, community-backed project, capable to cope with future requirements effectively.

  ### PedidosYa

  PedidosYa, a brand of the German multinational company Delivery Hero, is a leading online delivery company in Latin America that connects millions of people with thousands of restaurants, markets, pharmacies and other partners in 15 countries. PedidosYa engineering platform is based on a microservices architecture running on containers. We use Bottlerocket as the base OS for all the nodes of our Kubernetes clusters which run hundreds of microservices on top of them.

  We decided to use Bottlerocket for several reasons**:**

  **Speed:** due to the size and characteristics of our business, it is crucial for us to scale fast enough to provide our customers with an excellent experience. Our experience with Bottlerocket has been that startup time is about 20 seconds, which is great compared to the previous OS which was over 1.5 minutes.
   **Security:** Bottlerocket is built to run containers, so it only has the needed software for this, and its attack surface is reduced to its minimum.
   **Maintenance:** updates are delivered safely through the API, and rollbacks are easy and fast.
   **Easy to use:** configuration and migration was straightforward for us. Migration from Docker runtime to containerd was really easy.

  ### Cordial

  Cordial is a cross-channel marketing platform built to help marketers create unique and unified customer experiences across all channels. Cordial uses Bottlerocket OS for Kubernetes worker nodes across multiple EKS clusters, powering applications and ci-cd runners. We adopted Bottlerocket for the three main reasons:

  1. Bottlerocket has faster boot times and helps us scale our k8s clusters and applications faster

  2. Bottlerocket has a small attack surface

  3. The TOML config format used by Bottlerocket makes customization of kubelet settings very simple

---

Linux namespaces provide isolation for running processes, limiting their access
to system resources without the running process being aware of the limitations.
For more information on Linux namespaces, see
[Linux namespaces](https://www.linux.com/news/understanding-and-securing-linux-namespaces).

The best way to prevent privilege-escalation attacks from within a container is
to configure your container's applications to run as unprivileged users. For
containers whose processes must run as the `root` user within the container, you
can re-map this user to a less-privileged user on the Docker host. The mapped
user is assigned a range of UIDs which function within the namespace as normal
UIDs from 0 to 65536, but have no privileges on the host machine itself.

## [About remapping and subordinate user and group IDs](#about-remapping-and-subordinate-user-and-group-ids)

The remapping itself is handled by two files: `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid`.
Each file works the same, but one is concerned with the user ID range, and the
other with the group ID range. Consider the following entry in `/etc/subuid`:

```
testuser:231072:65536
```

This means that `testuser` is assigned a subordinate user ID range of `231072`
and the next 65536 integers in sequence. UID `231072` is mapped within the
namespace (within the container, in this case) as UID `0` (`root`). UID `231073`
is mapped as UID `1`, and so forth. If a process attempts to escalate privilege
outside of the namespace, the process is running as an unprivileged high-number
UID on the host, which does not even map to a real user. This means the process
has no privileges on the host system at all.

When you configure Docker to use the `userns-remap` feature, you can optionally
specify an existing user and/or group, or you can specify `default`. If you
specify `default`, a user and group `dockremap` is created and used for this
purpose.

It is very important that the ranges do not overlap, so that a process cannot gain
access in a different namespace. On most Linux distributions, system utilities
manage the ranges for you when you add or remove users.

This re-mapping is transparent to the container, but introduces some
configuration complexity in situations where the container needs access to
resources on the Docker host, such as bind mounts into areas of the filesystem
that the system user cannot write to. From a security standpoint, it is best to
avoid these situations.

## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

1. The subordinate UID and GID ranges must be associated with an existing user,
   even though the association is an implementation detail. The user owns
   the namespaced storage directories under `/var/lib/docker/`. If you don't
   want to use an existing user, Docker can create one for you and use that. If
   you want to use an existing username or user ID, it must already exist.
   Typically, this means that the relevant entries need to be in
   `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group`, but if you are using a different
   authentication back-end, this requirement may translate differently.

   To verify this, use the `id` command:

   ```
   $ id testuser
   uid=1001(testuser) gid=1001(testuser) groups=1001(testuser)

   ```
2. The way the namespace remapping is handled on the host is using two files,
   `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid`. These files are typically managed
   automatically when you add or remove users or groups, but on some
   distributions, you may need to manage these files manually.

   Each file contains three fields: the username or ID of the user, followed by
   a beginning UID or GID (which is treated as UID or GID 0 within the namespace)
   and a maximum number of UIDs or GIDs available to the user. For instance,
   given the following entry:

   ```
   testuser:231072:65536
   ```

   This means that user-namespaced processes started by `testuser` are
   owned by host UID `231072` (which looks like UID `0` inside the
   namespace) through 296607 (231072 + 65536 - 1). These ranges should not overlap,
   to ensure that namespaced processes cannot access each other's namespaces.

   After adding your user, check `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` to see if your
   user has an entry in each. If not, you need to add it, being careful to
   avoid overlap.

   If you want to use the `dockremap` user automatically created by Docker,
   check for the `dockremap` entry in these files after
   configuring and restarting Docker.
3. If there are any locations on the Docker host where the unprivileged
   user needs to write, adjust the permissions of those locations
   accordingly. This is also true if you want to use the `dockremap` user
   automatically created by Docker, but you can't modify the
   permissions until after configuring and restarting Docker.
4. Enabling `userns-remap` effectively masks existing image and container
   layers, as well as other Docker objects within `/var/lib/docker/`. This is
   because Docker needs to adjust the ownership of these resources and actually
   stores them in a subdirectory within `/var/lib/docker/`. It is best to enable
   this feature on a new Docker installation rather than an existing one.

   Along the same lines, if you disable `userns-remap` you can't access any
   of the resources created while it was enabled.
5. Check the
   [limitations](#user-namespace-known-limitations) on user
   namespaces to be sure your use case is possible.

## [Enable userns-remap on the daemon](#enable-userns-remap-on-the-daemon)

You can start `dockerd` with the `--userns-remap` flag or follow this
procedure to configure the daemon using the `daemon.json` configuration file.
The `daemon.json` method is recommended. If you use the flag, use the following
command as a model:

```
$ dockerd --userns-remap="testuser:testuser"

```

1. Edit `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. Assuming the file was previously empty, the
   following entry enables `userns-remap` using user and group called
   `testuser`. You can address the user and group by ID or name. You only need to
   specify the group name or ID if it is different from the user name or ID. If
   you provide both the user and group name or ID, separate them by a colon
   (`:`) character. The following formats all work for the value, assuming
   the UID and GID of `testuser` are `1001`:

   * `testuser`
   * `testuser:testuser`
   * `1001`
   * `1001:1001`
   * `testuser:1001`
   * `1001:testuser`

   ```
   {
     "userns-remap": "testuser"
   }
   ```
   > **Note**
   >
   >
   >
   > To use the `dockremap` user and have Docker create it for you,
   > set the value to `default` rather than `testuser`.

   Save the file and restart Docker.
2. If you are using the `dockremap` user, verify that Docker created it using
   the `id` command.

   ```
   $ id dockremap
   uid=112(dockremap) gid=116(dockremap) groups=116(dockremap)

   ```

   Verify that the entry has been added to `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid`:

   ```
   $ grep dockremap /etc/subuid
   dockremap:231072:65536
   $ grep dockremap /etc/subgid
   dockremap:231072:65536

   ```

   If these entries are not present, edit the files as the `root` user and
   assign a starting UID and GID that is the highest-assigned one plus the
   offset (in this case, `65536`). Be careful not to allow any overlap in the
   ranges.
3. Verify that previous images are not available using the `docker image ls`
   command. The output should be empty.
4. Start a container from the `hello-world` image.

   ```
   $ docker run hello-world

   ```
5. Verify that a namespaced directory exists within `/var/lib/docker/` named
   with the UID and GID of the namespaced user, owned by that UID and GID,
   and not group-or-world-readable. Some of the subdirectories are still
   owned by `root` and have different permissions.

   ```
   $ sudo ls -ld /var/lib/docker/231072.231072/
   drwx------ 11 231072 231072 11 Jun 21 21:19 /var/lib/docker/231072.231072/
   $ sudo ls -l /var/lib/docker/231072.231072/
   total 14
   drwx------ 5 231072 231072 5 Jun 21 21:19 aufs
   drwx------ 3 231072 231072 3 Jun 21 21:21 containers
   drwx------ 3 root   root   3 Jun 21 21:19 image
   drwxr-x--- 3 root   root   3 Jun 21 21:19 network
   drwx------ 4 root   root   4 Jun 21 21:19 plugins
   drwx------ 2 root   root   2 Jun 21 21:19 swarm
   drwx------ 2 231072 231072 2 Jun 21 21:21 tmp
   drwx------ 2 root   root   2 Jun 21 21:19 trust
   drwx------ 2 231072 231072 3 Jun 21 21:19 volumes

   ```

   Your directory listing may have some differences, especially if you
   use a different container storage driver than `aufs`.

   The directories which are owned by the remapped user are used instead
   of the same directories directly beneath `/var/lib/docker/` and the
   unused versions (such as `/var/lib/docker/tmp/` in the example here)
   can be removed. Docker does not use them while `userns-remap` is
   enabled.

## [Disable namespace remapping for a container](#disable-namespace-remapping-for-a-container)

If you enable user namespaces on the daemon, all containers are started with
user namespaces enabled by default. In some situations, such as privileged
containers, you may need to disable user namespaces for a specific container.
See
[user namespace known limitations](#user-namespace-known-limitations)
for some of these limitations.

To disable user namespaces for a specific container, add the `--userns=host`
flag to the `docker container create`, `docker container run`, or `docker container exec` command.

There is a side effect when using this flag: user remapping will not be enabled for that container but, because the read-only (image) layers are shared between containers, ownership of the containers filesystem will still be remapped.

What this means is that the whole container filesystem will belong to the user specified in the `--userns-remap` daemon config (`231072` in the example above). This can lead to unexpected behavior of programs inside the container. For instance `sudo` (which checks that its binaries belong to user `0`) or binaries with a `setuid` flag.

## [User namespace known limitations](#user-namespace-known-limitations)

The following standard Docker features are incompatible with running a Docker
daemon with user namespaces enabled:

* Sharing PID or NET namespaces with the host (`--pid=host` or `--network=host`).
* External (volume or storage) drivers which are unaware or incapable of using
  daemon user mappings.
* Using the `--privileged` mode flag on `docker run` without also specifying
  `--userns=host`.

User namespaces are an advanced feature and require coordination with other
capabilities. For example, if volumes are mounted from the host, file ownership
must be pre-arranged if you need read or write access to the volume contents.

While the root user inside a user-namespaced container process has many of the
expected privileges of the superuser within the container, the Linux kernel
imposes restrictions based on internal knowledge that this is a user-namespaced
process. One notable restriction is the inability to use the `mknod` command.
Permission is denied for device creation within the container when run by
the `root` user.

## **Executive Summary**

Following [Log4Shell](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/apache-log4j-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228/), AWS released several [hot patch solutions](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/announcements/2021-001.html) that monitor for vulnerable Java applications and Java [containers](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/advice-on-mitigating-the-apache-log4j-security-issue-for-eks-ecs-and-fargate-customers/) and patch them on the fly. Each solution suits a different environment, covering standalone servers, Kubernetes clusters, Elastic Container Service (ECS) clusters and Fargate. The hot patches aren't exclusive to AWS environments and can be installed onto any cloud or on-premises environment.

Unit 42 researchers identified severe security issues within these patching solutions and partnered with AWS to remediate them. After installing the patch service to a server or cluster, every container in that environment can exploit it to take over its underlying host. For example, if you [installed the hot patch to a Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/aws-samples/kubernetes-log4j-cve-2021-44228-node-agent), every container in your cluster can now escape until you either disable the hot patch or upgrade to the fixed version. Aside from containers, unprivileged processes can also exploit the patch to escalate privileges and gain root code execution.

Containers can escape regardless of whether they run Java applications, or whether their underlying host runs [Bottlerocket](https://aws.amazon.com/bottlerocket/), AWS's hardened Linux distribution for containers. Containers running with [user namespaces](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/userns-remap/) or as a non-root user are affected as well. Unit 42 assigned CVE-2021-3100, CVE-2021-3101, CVE-2022-0070 and CVE-2022-0071 to track the vulnerabilities.

AWS released a fixed version for each hot patch solution on April 19:

1. Version 1.1-16 of the log4j-cve-2021-44228-hotpatch [package](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/announcements/2021-001.html), which bundles the hot patch service.
2. Version 1.1-16 of the kubernetes-log4j-cve-2021-44228-node-agent [Daemonset](https://github.com/aws-samples/kubernetes-log4j-cve-2021-44228-node-agent), which installs the updated package.
3. Version 1.02 of [Hotdog](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/hotdog), a hot patch solution for Bottlerocket hosts based on Open Container Initiative (OCI) hooks.

Unit 42 advises anyone who installed any of these hot patches to upgrade to a fixed version. Note that starting from Dec. 17, 2021, JDK packages (Java installations) on Amazon Linux [automatically installed](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/announcements/2021-001.html) the log4j-cve-2021-44228-hotpatch package. Alternatively, users who are confident their applications are patched against Log4Shell can disable the hot patch service following the instructions in the Mitigations section below.

[Prisma Cloud](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/cloud) detects the hot patch package and will alert on hosts running a vulnerable version.

## **Overview of AWS Log4Shell Hot Patches**

Log4Shell proved itself as one of the worst vulnerabilities of recent times. To help users combat the issue at scale, AWS open-sourced several hot patch solutions, each covering a different environment. Hot patching is the process of injecting a fix to a vulnerable running application. It's meant to serve as a short-term solution until a new, fixed version of the application can be deployed.

AWS released three hot patching solutions that detect processes and containers running vulnerable Java applications and patch them on the fly:

1. A [hot patch service](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/announcements/2021-001.html) bundled in an RPM package. Starting from Dec. 17, 2021, this service is automatically installed with Amazon Linux JDK (Java) packages. Fargate customers could've asked for this service to be installed on the hosts running their containers.
2. A [hot patch Daemonset](https://github.com/aws-samples/kubernetes-log4j-cve-2021-44228-node-agent) for Kubernetes clusters, which installs the aforementioned hot patch service on all nodes.
3. [Hotdog](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/hotdog), a hot patch solution bundled as a set of OCI hooks. Hotdog is primarily intended for Bottlerocket hosts.

These solutions cover most compute environments, from Kubernetes clusters to ECS clusters, Fargate containers and standalone servers. They aren't exclusive to AWS environments, and can be installed onto other cloud environments or on-premises.

Unit 42 researchers discovered these patches can be exploited for container escape and privilege escalation. After any one of the patches is installed to a host or cluster, new containers can exploit the patch to escape and compromise their underlying host. On hosts that installed either the hot patch service or the hot patch Daemonset, existing containers can escape as well. Aside from containers, unprivileged processes can also exploit the patch service to escalate privileges and gain root code execution. AWS has now mitigated these vulnerabilities and released a fix for each solution.

## **Root Cause Analysis**

AWS's hot patch solutions continuously search for Java processes and patch them against Log4Shell on the fly. Any process running a binary named “java“ – inside or outside of a container – is considered a candidate for the hot patch.

To patch Java processes inside containers, the hot patch solutions invoke certain container binaries. For example, they run the container's "java" binary twice: once to retrieve the Java version, and again to inject the hot patch. The issue was that they invoked container binaries without properly containerizing them. That is, the new processes would run without the limitations normally applied to container processes.

For example, the "java" binary was invoked in the container namespaces via the [nsenter](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/nsenter.1.html) command (excluding the user namespace). But aside from that, it was spawned with all [Linux capabilities](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html), and without the [isolation technologies that normally confine containers](https://opensource.com/article/21/8/container-linux-technology), such as [seccomp](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html) and [cgroups](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html). It also ran as the root user regardless of the container's user.

A malicious container therefore could have included a malicious binary named “java” to trick the installed hot patch solution into invoking it with elevated privileges. The malicious “java” process could then abuse its elevated privileges to escape the container and take over the underlying host. The fixed hot patch solutions now properly containerize container binaires before running them.

Aside from containers, the hot patch service also patched host processes in a similar manner. A malicious unprivileged process could have created and run a malicious binary named "java" to trick the hot patch service into executing it with elevated privileges. The fixed hot patch service now spawns “java” binaries with the same privileges as the Java process being patched.

## **Container Escape Demo**

To verify the vulnerability is exploitable, we built a proof of concept (PoC) container image. When deployed to a cluster or VM that runs a vulnerable version of a hot patch solution, the container exploits the vulnerabilities to escape and gain root code execution on the underlying host. It then sends a [reverse shell](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/20-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/runtime_defense/incident_types/reverse_shell.html) to an attacker-controlled server.

In the demo video below, a user installed the hot patch Daemonset to an EKS cluster. The demo then simulates a supply chain attack by showing what happens when the user inadvertently runs a malicious container image that exploits the hot patch.

*Video 1. CVE-2021-3100 exploit demo.*

While the demo showcases a supply chain attack, existing containers that were compromised (e.g. by a network payload) can also exploit the issues to escape and take over their underlying host. We've decided not to share the exploit's implementation details at this time to prevent malicious parties from weaponizing it.

## **Impact**

Given the urgency surrounding Log4Shell, users may have deployed hot patches at scale, inadvertently putting container environments at risk. Even after Java applications were patched against Log4Shell, users may have kept the hot patch running for defense-in-depth as there isn't a strong incentive to remove it.

Containers are often used as a security boundary between applications running on the same machine. A container escape allows an attacker to extend a campaign beyond a single application and compromise neighboring services. In Kubernetes clusters, a single container escape is unfortunately sometimes enough to take over the entire cluster.

The issues are exploitable regardless of the container configuration, so even environments that enable advanced isolation techniques like running containers in [user namespaces](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/userns-remap/) or as a non-root user are affected.

Aside from containers, unprivileged processes could have also exploited the vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and gain full control over their underlying server.

## **Mitigations**

AWS released a fix for each hot patch solution. Once a host runs a fixed version, container escape and privilege escalation are no longer possible.

1. In Kubernetes clusters, you can install the fixed hot patch version by deploying the [latest Daemonset](https://github.com/aws-samples/kubernetes-log4j-cve-2021-44228-node-agent) provided by AWS. Note that only deleting the hot patch Daemonset doesn't remove the hot patch service from your nodes. **Updated April 25**: Currently, there isn't a fixed Daemonset version for Debian-based hosts (Debian and Ubuntu). See this [GitHub thread](https://github.com/aws-samples/kubernetes-log4j-cve-2021-44228-node-agent/commit/cacdf35d40a3f1da84dac6aae9e807ac1b2c9d4f#commitcomment-72082620) for more details. **Updated May 5**: A fixed Daemonset version for Debian-based hosts was released. Note that the fixed version for the Debian log4j-cve-2021-44228-hotpatch package is **1.1.17**.
2. On standalone hosts, you can upgrade by running yum update log4j-cve-2021-44228-hotpatch.
3. Hotdog users need to upgrade to the [latest version](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/hotdog/releases).

Alternatively, if you're confident that your environment is patched against Log4Shell, you can disable the hot patch service on a host by running sudo touch /etc/log4j-cve-2021-44228-hotpatch.kill. To disable Hotdog, run apiclient set oci-hooks.log4j-hotpatch-enabled=false.

Prisma Cloud customers can identify affected hosts under the Vulnerabilities tab. The platform detects the hot patch packages and alerts customers on VMs running a vulnerable version. To search for the vulnerabilities, use the Amazon Linux Security Advisories (ALAS) IDs associated with them: ALAS-2021-1554, ALAS-2021-1732, ALAS-2022-1580 and ALAS-2022-1773.

![Prisma Cloud detects and alerts on vulnerable log4j-cve-2021-44228-hotpatch versions.]()

Palo Alto Networks [Prisma Cloud](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/cloud), [Cortex XDR](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr) and [Next-Generation Firewalls](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall) (NGFWs) can detect follow-on attacker activities and disrupt command and control communications like the reverse shell used in the demo.

## **Safely Interacting With Containers**

CVE-2021-3100, CVE-2021-3101, CVE-2022-0070 and CVE-2022-0071 add to a long list of container escape vulnerabilities that arise from a host process directly interacting with a running container. Simple tasks like copying files or spawning a new containerized process can have surprising outcomes when the container is malicious.

If you're building software around containers, defer to an established container runtime like [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) for operations involving a container's processes or filesystem. Although they have also had their share of vulnerabilities, container runtimes are by far the most vetted and mature programs for safely interacting with containers.

## **Conclusion**

Given the urgency surrounding Log4Shell, users may have deployed hot patches at scale, inadvertently putting container environments at risk. We encourage users to upgrade to the fixed hot patch version as soon as possible. Multitenant container environments and clusters running untrusted images are especially at risk.

If you're still patching against Log4Shell, prioritize that effort first. While the presented issues can lead to severe attacks against container environments, Log4Shell has rightfully earned its spot as one of the worst vulnerabilities of all time and is still being actively exploited.

We'd like to thank AWS for their partnership and coordination in remediating this vulnerability efficiently. As Log4Shell exploitation peaked, AWS's hot patch helped the community stop countless attacks. With these vulnerabilities fixed, it's now possible to use the hot patch to address Log4Shell while also keeping container environments secure.
