      "CveDescription": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Bugzilla": {
      "RootCause": "In ImfScanLineInputFile.cpp, large lineOffset and bytesPerLine tables could cause OpenEXR to allocate excessive memory due to a missing check for `_data->linesInBuffer`.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-memory"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker able to submit a crafted file to be processed by OpenEXR could consume excessive system memory, leading to denial of service.",
      "AttackVectors": [
        "Processing a crafted OpenEXR file"
      ],
      "AttackerCapabilities": "Attacker can submit a crafted file to be processed by OpenEXR.",
	  "MoreDetails": "The issue lies in the `ImfScanLineInputFile.cpp` file, where missing a check for `_data->linesInBuffer` in the if statement allowed large `lineOffset` and `bytesPerLine` tables to cause excessive memory allocation."
    },
	"Debian": {
      "Impact": "Buffer overflows or out-of-bound reads could lead to a denial of service (application crash) if a malformed image file is processed."
    },
    "Gentoo": {
      "Impact": "The worst of which could result in the arbitrary execution of code.",
