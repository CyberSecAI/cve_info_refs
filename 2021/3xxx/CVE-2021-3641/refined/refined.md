- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists within the Bitdefender GravityZone Endpoint Agent due to improper handling of symbolic links. An attacker can create a symbolic link that the service will follow, resulting in the overwriting of a file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the service's failure to validate the target of a symbolic link, allowing for arbitrary file overwriting. This is a file system vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to overwrite files, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local. The attacker must have local access to the system, and must be able to execute low-privileged code. The attacker creates a malicious symbolic link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
