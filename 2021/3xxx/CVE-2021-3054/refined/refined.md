- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition exists in the PAN-OS web interface during plugin installation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: TOCTOU race condition.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated administrator with permission to upload plugins can execute arbitrary code with root user privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based exploitation via the PAN-OS web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator with the permission to upload plugins to the PAN-OS web interface.
