Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability is a prototype pollution issue in the `ObjectUtil.js` file of the `utils.js` library. The `set()` function within this utility was vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The `set` function in `ObjectUtil.js` was vulnerable to prototype pollution. This occurs when an attacker can modify the prototype of an object, leading to unexpected behavior and potential security issues for all objects inheriting from this prototype.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Modifying the prototype of an object can lead to unexpected behavior in applications that rely on the library.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In some cases, if an application uses this library and is vulnerable to this kind of manipulation, it could be exploited to achieve RCE by an attacker injecting malicious properties/code into the object prototype, which may get executed by the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by using a specially crafted key (specifically `__proto__`) as an argument to the `set` function of `ObjectUtil.js`.
- An attacker could exploit this by passing a malicious object, where the key includes a `__proto__` property, to the vulnerable function of the library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to control the arguments passed to the vulnerable `set` function in `ObjectUtil.js`.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to call the `set` function with the malicious payload.
- The attacker would need knowledge that the application is using the vulnerable `utils.js` library.
- The commit history shows that a fix has been implemented to prevent pollution by checking for the `__proto__` key within the function and not proceeding if it is found.

**Additional details:**
- The commit message in the GitHub content mentions "Fixed prototype pollution" and references issue #6, which provides further context to the fix.
- The diff shows that code has been added to check if the key is equal to `__proto__` and, if so, it will break out of the loop, thus preventing the prototype pollution.
- The test case adds a test to check and ensure that prototype pollution is not possible with the fix.
