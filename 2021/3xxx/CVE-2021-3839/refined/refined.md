{
  "CVE-2021-3839": {
    "Description": "The vhost library in DPDK has an out-of-bounds read/write vulnerability in the vhost_user_set_inflight_fd() function due to a missing check on `msg->payload.inflight.num_queues`. This can lead to a crash when software using the DPDK vhost library processes an inflight message with a queue number larger than the maximum number of queues (VHOST_MAX_VRING).",
    "Root cause": "Missing validation of the `msg->payload.inflight.num_queues` variable before using it to access memory.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read/write"
    ],
    "Impact": "Out-of-bounds memory access can cause a crash of the affected software.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious vhost-user master can send crafted `VHOST_USER_SET_INFLIGHT_FD` messages with a large queue number.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to control the vhost-user master to send malformed messages to the vhost-user slave."
