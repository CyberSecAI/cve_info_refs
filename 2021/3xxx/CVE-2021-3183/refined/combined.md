Hi,

Vendor: Files.com
Product: Fat Client
Tested version: 3.3.6 but newer version high likely also affected
Credit: Balazs Hambalko, IT Security Consultant

This vulnerability was identified and reported promptly to the vendor in
April 2020.
The answer was they do not see any risk here.

Anyway I would like to share my POC video, only for learning purposes.

According to the vendor, there is no risk here, on the other hand, I built
up a playground and being a Domain Admin I could gain normal user's
Files.com storage access.

Personally I do not recommend using this solution in an environment where
somebody can access your C drive (using Windows Domain or common machines -
library, net coffee, and so on...)

POC: <https://youtu.be/Ay_iYFtPrcs>

Kind regards,
Balazs Hambalko
