The provided content describes an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Files.com Fat Client application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability allows an attacker with access to the C drive of a machine running the Files.com Fat Client to bypass authentication and gain access to a normal user's Files.com storage.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Authentication bypass: The application does not properly protect user credentials or session information stored on the local file system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Unauthorized access: An attacker can gain access to another user's Files.com storage.
*   Data breach: An attacker can potentially access, modify, or delete files stored in the user's storage.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Local access: An attacker requires access to the C drive of a machine where the Files.com Fat Client is installed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have access to the local file system (specifically the C drive) of a machine where the Files.com Fat Client is installed and has been used by a legitimate user. This could be achieved through various methods like social engineering, physical access, or through the use of compromised accounts in a windows domain.
