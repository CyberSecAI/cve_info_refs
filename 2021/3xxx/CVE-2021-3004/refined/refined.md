  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the number of tokens minted being inconsistent with the intended one. The `_deposit` function in the `StableYieldCredit` contract calculates the value of deposited tokens in USD using ChainLink oracle. However, when adding liquidity to the WBTC-yCREDIT pair pool, the contract calculates the amount of WBTC to add based on the existing reserves inside the pool, which could be manipulated. Due to the inconsistency between these calculations, the attacker can receive more yCREDIT tokens than intended.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Inconsistent calculation of token value for minting and liquidity provision.",
        "Reliance on potentially manipulated pool reserves for liquidity calculation.",
        "Lack of validation between the amount of tokens minted and deposited."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can mint more yCREDIT tokens than intended by depositing WBTC, leading to a profit by selling the additional tokens.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Manipulating the reserves inside the WBTC-yCREDIT pair pool.",
        "Depositing WBTC into the vulnerable `StableYieldCredit` contract."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the reserves in the WBTC-yCREDIT pair pool, deposit WBTC into the `StableYieldCredit` contract, and have the ability to trade the gained yCREDIT tokens in exchanges."
