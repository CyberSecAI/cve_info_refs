Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-3277:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper validation of the filename during the rename operation in the custom-includes component of Nagios XI.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of file name validation in the `rename_file()` function.
- The function takes the old file ID, and the new file name, and then renames the old file to the new filename without proper validation.
- The `rename()` function in PHP will perform the file rename even if the new filename contains path traversal characters or a different file extension than the original.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Allows an authenticated administrator to upload arbitrary files to the server.
- Remote code execution may be achieved by uploading and renaming a file with a malicious extension (e.g., .php).

**Attack vectors:**
- Authenticated administrator can access the "custom includes" component of Nagios XI
- Attacker uploads a file (e.g., a .png file).
- Attacker renames the file to an arbitrary file name, potentially containing path traversal characters and a malicious extension (e.g., ../../../evil.php)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated administrator in Nagios XI.
