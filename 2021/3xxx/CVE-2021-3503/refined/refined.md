Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) restrictions on the metrics data within Wildfly. When RBAC is enabled, users can access more metrics data than they should be authorized to see.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insufficient RBAC restrictions on metrics endpoint.
- The `security-enabled` attribute controlling metrics access was not properly enforced when RBAC was enabled.
- When RBAC is enabled, metrics throws exception because certain management resources were not found due to lack of proper access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exposure of sensitive metrics data to unauthorized users.
- Potential confidentiality breach by allowing users to view metrics beyond their authorization.
- May cause exceptions and errors that flood the logs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network access to the Wildfly management interface.
- Exploitation through the metrics endpoint (`/metrics`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to have low privileges.
- Access to the Wildfly management interface where RBAC is enabled.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was identified when attempting to access the metrics endpoint after enabling RBAC.
- The vulnerability was resolved in Wildfly version 23.0.1.Final.
- The fix involves returning an empty `ModelNode` for attributes restricted by RBAC. This ensures that `isDefined()` answers correctly.
- The problem occurred because the metrics endpoint was not properly considering RBAC restrictions and allowed access to metrics even for users who should not have been able to access specific attributes.
- The fix involved changes in `org/wildfly/extension/metrics/WildFlyMetric.java`.
