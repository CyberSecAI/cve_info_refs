* **Git Pull Request:**
  <https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/pull/14136>

### Description

Accordingly to <https://docs.wildfly.org/17/Admin_Guide.html#http-endpoint-2> and <https://wildscribe.github.io/WildFly/17.0/subsystem/microprofile-metrics-smallrye/index.html>, access to metrics endpoint is controlled by the security-enabled attribute.

When this attribute is set to false, there is an Exception when metrics are accessed. By default, this attribute is set to false on standalone.xml config.

Please, refer to steps to reproduce. This error occurs only when RBAC are enabled.

When RBAC is enabled for management in Wildfly, metrics throws exception:

java.lang.IllegalStateException: WFLYMETRICS0003: Unable to read attribute XAForgetAverageTime on [

("subsystem" => "datasources"),

("data-source" => "ExampleDS"),

("statistics" => "pool")

]: "WFLYCTL0216: Management resource '[

(\"subsystem\" => \"datasources\"),

(\"data-source\" => \"ExampleDS\"),

(\"statistics\" => \"pool\")

]' not found".

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
