# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

This flaw allows attackers to perform command injection, which discloses sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2021-07-07 10:40:38 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

## [v2.9.23](#id81)

### [Release Summary](#id82)

Release Date: 2021-06-22
[Porting Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html)

### [Security Fixes](#id83)

* templating engine fix for not preserving usnafe status when trying to preserve newlines. CVE-2021-3583

### [Bugfixes](#id84)

* Backport to fix missing `changed` in net\_get ([#74802](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/74802))
* firewalld - ensure idempotency with firewalld 0.9.3 ([ansible-collections/ansible.posix#179](https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.posix/issues/179)).

## [v2.9.22](#id85)

### [Release Summary](#id86)

Release Date: 2021-05-24
[Porting Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html)

### [Minor Changes](#id87)

* ansible-test - cap websocket-client on python 2 because 1.0.0 stops supporting it.

### [Bugfixes](#id88)

* ansible-test - Use documented API to retrieve build information from Azure Pipelines.
* ansible\_test - add constraint for `MarkupSafe` ([#74666](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/74666))
* filter plugins - patch new versions of Jinja2 to prevent warnings/errors on renamed filter decorators ([#74667](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/74667))

## [v2.9.21](#id89)

### [Release Summary](#id90)

Release Date: 2021-05-03
[Porting Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html)

### [Major Changes](#id91)

* ansible-test - Tests run with the `centos6` and `default` test containers now use a PyPI proxy container to access PyPI when Python 2.6 is used. This allows tests running under Python 2.6 to continue functioning even though PyPI is discontinuing support for non-SNI capable clients.

### [Minor Changes](#id92)

* Switch to hashlib.sha256() for ansible-test to allow for FIPs mode.
* ansible-test - Use version 1.21.0 of opensuse test containers which is 15.2, since 15.1 is now EOL.

### [Bugfixes](#id93)

* ansible-test - Avoid publishing the port used by the `pypi-test-container` since it is only accessed by other containers. This avoids issues when trying to run tests in parallel on a single host.
* ansible-test - Fix docker container IP address detection. The `bridge` network is no longer assumed to be the default.
* ansible-test - ensure the correct unit test target is given when the `__init__.py` file is modified inside the connection plugins directory
* validate-modules - do not raise an `AttributeError` if a value is assigned to a module attribute in a try/except block.

## [v2.9.20](#id94)

### [Release Summary](#id95)

Release Date: 2021-04-12
[Porting Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html)

### [Minor Changes](#id96)

* aws module\_defaults - add rds\_option\_group, rds\_option\_group\_info
* aws module\_defaults - add wafv2\_ip\_set, wafv2\_ip\_set\_info, wafv2\_resources, wafv2\_resources\_info, wafv2\_rule\_group, wafv2\_rule\_group\_info, wafv2\_web\_acl, wafv2\_web\_acl\_info
* azure\_rm\_roledefinition - module specification is now valid.
* module payload builder - module\_utils imports in any nested block (eg, `try`, `if`) are treated as optional during module payload builds; this allows modules to implement runtime fallback behavior for module\_utils that do not exist in older versions of Ansible.
* module\_defaults - add module rds\_snapshot to aws module\_defaults group ([#74113](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/74113)).
* nmcli - fix the slaving of bridge interfaces ([#74125](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/74125)).

### [Breaking Changes / Porting Guide](#id97)

* docker\_swarm - if `join_token` is specified, a returned join token with the same value will be replaced by `VALUE_SPECIFIED_IN_NO_LOG_PARAMETER`. Make sure that you do not blindly use the join tokens from the return value of this module when the module is invoked with `join_token` specified! This breaking change appears in a minor release since it is necessary to fix a security issue ([ansible-collections/community.docker#103](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/103)). (CVE-2021-3447)

### [Security Fixes](#id98)

* Strategy - When building the task in the Strategy from the Worker, ensure it is properly marked as finalized and squashed. Addresses an issue with `ansible_failed_task`. ([#57399](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/57399))
* ansible-test - The `--export` option for `ansible-test coverage` is now limited to the `combine` command. It was previously available for reporting commands on which it had no effect.
* ansible-test - The `ansible-test coverage combine` option `--export` now exports relative paths. This avoids loss of coverage data when aggregating across systems with different absolute paths. Paths will be converted back to absolute when generating reports.
* ansible-test - ensure unit test paths for connection and inventory plugins are correctly identified for collections ([#73876](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73876)).
* apt - fix policy\_rc\_d parameter throwing an exception when restoring original file ([#66211](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/66211))
* find - fix default pattern when use\_regex is true ([#50067](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/50067)).

* vmware\_cluster - Document alternatives for deprecated parameters

### [Removed Features (previously deprecated)](#id156)

* ldap\_attr, ldap\_entry - The `params` option has been removed in Ansible-2.10 as it circumvents Ansible's option handling. Setting `bind_pw` with the `params` option was disallowed in Ansible-2.7, 2.8, and 2.9 as it was insecure. For information about this policy, see the discussion at: <https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/ansible-meeting/2017-09-28/ansible_dev_meeting.2017-09-28-15.00.log.html> This fixes CVE-2020-1746

### [Security Fixes](#id157)

* **security issue** - The `subversion` module provided the password via the svn command line option `--password` and can be retrieved from the host's /proc/<pid>/cmdline file. Update the module to use the secure `--password-from-stdin` option instead, and add a warning in the module and in the documentation if svn version is too old to support it. (CVE-2020-1739)
* **security issue** win\_unzip - normalize paths in archive to ensure extracted files do not escape from the target directory (CVE-2020-1737)
* **security\_issue** - create temporary vault file with strict permissions when editing and prevent race condition (CVE-2020-1740)
* Ensure we get an error when creating a remote tmp if it already exists. CVE-2020-1733
* In fetch action, avoid using slurp return to set up dest, also ensure no dir traversal CVE-2020-1735.

### [Bugfixes](#id174)

* **SECURITY** - CVE-2019-14904 - solaris\_zone module accepts zone name and performs actions related to that. However, there is no user input validation done while performing actions. A malicious user could provide a crafted zone name which allows executing commands into the server manipulating the module behaviour. Adding user input validation as per Solaris Zone documentation fixes this issue.
* ActionBase - Add new `cleanup` method that is explicitly run by the `TaskExecutor` to ensure that the shell plugins `tmpdir` is always removed. This change means that individual action plugins need not be responsible for removing the temporary directory, which ensures that we don't have code paths that accidentally leave behind the temporary directory.
* CVE-2019-14905 - nxos\_file\_copy module accepts remote\_file parameter which is used for destination name and performs actions related to that on the device using the value of remote\_file which is of string type However, there is no user input validation done while performing actions. A malicious code could crafts the filename parameter to take advantage by performing an OS command injection. This fix validates the option value if it is legitimate file path or not.

Debian Bug     : 1053693

Ansible a configuration management, deployment, and task execution system
was affected by multiple vulnerabilities.

CVE-2019-10206

    Fix a regression in test suite of CVE-2019-10206.

CVE-2021-3447

    A flaw was found in several
    ansible modules, where parameters containing credentials,
    such as secrets, were being logged in plain-text on
    managed nodes, as well as being made visible on the
    controller node when run in verbose mode. These parameters
    were not protected by the no_log feature. An attacker can
    take advantage of this information to steal those credentials,
    provided when they have access to the log files
    containing them. The highest threat from this vulnerability
    is to data confidentiality

CVE-2021-3583

    A flaw was found in Ansible, where
    a user's controller is vulnerable to template injection.
    This issue can occur through facts used in the template
    if the user is trying to put templates in multi-line YAML
    strings and the facts being handled do not routinely
    include special template characters. This flaw allows
    attackers to perform command injection, which discloses
    sensitive information. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.

CVE-2021-3620

    A flaw was found in Ansible Engine's
    ansible-connection module, where sensitive information
    such as the Ansible user credentials is disclosed by
    default in the traceback error message. The highest
    threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.

CVE-2021-20178

    A flaw was found in ansible module
    snmp_fact where credentials are disclosed in the console log by
    default and not protected by the security feature
    This flaw allows an attacker to steal privkey and authkey
    credentials. The highest threat from this vulnerability
    is to confidentiality.

CVE-2021-20191

    A flaw was found in ansible. Credentials,
    such as secrets, are being disclosed in console log by default
    and not protected by no_log feature when using Cisco nxos moduel.
    An attacker can take advantage of this information to steal those
    credentials. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
    to data confidentiality.

CVE-2022-3697

    A flaw was found in Ansible in the amazon.aws
    collection when using the tower_callback parameter from the
    amazon.aws.ec2_instance module. This flaw allows an attacker
    to take advantage of this issue as the module is handling the
    parameter insecurely, leading to the password leaking in the logs.

CVE-2023-5115

    An absolute path traversal attack existed
    in the Ansible automation platform. This flaw allows an
    attacker to craft a malicious Ansible role and make the
    victim execute the role. A symlink can be used to
    overwrite a file outside of the extraction path.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.7.7+dfsg-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your ansible packages.

# YAML MultilineFind the right syntax for your YAML multiline strings

## Two Types of Formats for Strings

There are two types of formats that YAML supports for scalar strings.
(*Scalars* are what YAML calls basic values like numbers or strings, as opposed to complex types like arrays or objects.)

* **Flow scalar formats** are designed for robust simplicity but do have a limited escaping and line-break support. They are designed to ignore indentations.
* **Block scalar formats** provide more control over how they are interpreted by increasing sensitivity rules regarding indentations and escaping. These are designed to answer for cases whenever scalar flow formats become cumbersome or insufficient.

Although they are parsed by different rules, they all express strings, allowing authors to choose the option that expresses best what they need the string to be.

## Flow Scalars

### Single-quoted

YAML
```
example: 'A simple string.'
```
Result
```
A simple string.
```
YAML
```
example: 'Several lines of text,\n
Â·Â·containing ''single quotes'' and "double quotes".
Â·Â·Escapes (like \n) don''t do anything.\n
Â·Â·\n
Â·Â·Newlines can be added by leaving a blank line.\n
Â·Â·Â·Â·Leading whitespace on lines is ignored.'\n
```
Result
```
Several lines of text, containing 'single quotes' and "double quotes". Escapes (like \n) don't do anything.\n
Newlines can be added by leaving a blank line. Leading whitespace on lines is ignored.
```
### Double-quoted

YAML
```
example: "A simple string."
```
Result
```
A simple string.
```
YAML
```
example: "Several lines of text,\n
Â·Â·containing \"double quotes\" and 'single quotes'.
Â·Â·Escapes (like \\n) work.\nIn addition,\n
Â·Â·newlines can be esc\\n
Â·Â·aped to prevent them from being converted to a space.\n
Â·Â·\n
Â·Â·Newlines can also be added by leaving a blank line.\n
Â·Â·Â·Â·Leading whitespace on lines is ignored."\n
```
Result
```
Several lines of text, containing "double quotes" and 'single quotes'. Escapes (like \n) work.\n
In addition, newlines can be escaped to prevent them from being converted to a space.\n
Newlines can also be added by leaving a blank line. Leading whitespace on lines is ignored.\n
```
### Plain

YAML
```
example: A simple string.
```
Result
```
A simple string.
```
YAML
```
example: Several lines of text,\n
Â·Â·with some "quotes" of various 'types'.\n
Â·Â·Escapes (like \n) don't do anything.\n
Â·Â·\n
Â·Â·Newlines can be added by leaving a blank line.\n
Â·Â·Â·Â·Additional leading whitespace is ignored.\n
```
Result
```
Several lines of text, with some "quotes" of various 'types'. Escapes (like \n) don't do anything.\n
Newlines can be added by leaving a blank line. Additional leading whitespace is ignored.
```

â ï¸ Plain flow scalars (unquoted strings) have several pitfalls:

* Plain flow scalars are picky about the `:` and `#` characters.
  They can be in the string,
  but `:` cannot appear *before* a space or newline,
  and `#` cannot appear *after* a space or newline;
  doing this will cause a syntax error.
* Parsers which support YAML 1.1 may interpret the strings `y`, `n`, `yes`, `no`, `on`, and `off` (case-insensitive) as boolean values rather than strings.
* Leading and trailing whitespace will be removed.

If your strings are affected by any of these caveats you should use one of the quoted styles instead.

## Block Scalars

A block scalar header has three parts:

**Block Style Indicator**: The *[block style](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#812-literal-style)* indicates
how newlines inside the block should behave.
If you would like them to be kept as newlines, use the **literal**
style, indicated by a pipe (`|`).
If instead you want them to be replaced by spaces, use the **folded**
style, indicated by a right angle bracket (`>`).
(To get a newline using the folded style, leave a blank line by putting *two* newlines in.
Lines with extra indentation are also not folded.)

**Block Chomping Indicator**:
The *[chomping indicator](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#8112-block-chomping-indicator)* controls what should happen with newlines
at the *end* of the string.
The default, **clip**, puts a single newline at the end of the string.
To remove all newlines, **strip** them by putting a minus sign (`-`)
after the style indicator.
Both clip and strip ignore how many newlines are actually at the end of the block;
to **keep** them all put a plus sign (`+`) after the style indicator.

**Indentation Indicator**: Ordinarily, the number of spaces you're using to indent a block
will be automatically guessed from its first line.
You may need a *[block indentation indicator](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#8111-block-indentation-indicator)*
if the first line of the block starts with extra spaces.
In this case, simply put the number of spaces used for indentation (between 1 and 9)
at the end of the header.

### Demo
