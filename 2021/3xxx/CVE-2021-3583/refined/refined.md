{
  "CVE-2021-3583": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "Multiple",
      "Description": "A flaw was found in Ansible, where a user's controller is vulnerable to template injection. This issue can occur through facts used in the template if the user is trying to put templates in multi-line YAML strings and the facts being handled do not routinely include special template characters. This flaw allows attackers to perform command injection, which discloses sensitive information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "Template injection vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled data (facts) when used in multi-line YAML strings.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Template injection",
        "Improper input sanitization",
        "Exposure of sensitive information"
      ],
      "Impact": "Command injection leading to potential disclosure of sensitive information, loss of confidentiality and integrity.",
       "Attack Vectors": [
        "Exploiting template engine vulnerability in Ansible",
         "YAML multi-line strings usage"
       ],
      "Required Capabilities": "Ability to control facts used in Ansible templates, especially when constructing multi-line YAML strings."
    }
