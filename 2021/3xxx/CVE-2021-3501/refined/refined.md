Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-3501:

**1. Root cause of the vulnerability:**

*   **KVM API misuse**: The vulnerability lies in the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) API. Specifically, the `internal.ndata` value within the KVM API is used as an array index.
*   **User-controlled index:** This `internal.ndata` value can be updated by a user process at any time, leading to an out-of-bounds write if the value is not validated.
*   **`__vmx_handle_exit()` function**:  The function `__vmx_handle_exit()` in the kernel uses `vcpu->run->internal.ndata` to access an array. The `vcpu->run` struct, which contains `internal.ndata`, can be modified by user-space, allowing for an out-of-bounds write.
*   **polkit flaw**: In polkit, the function `polkit_system_bus_name_get_creds_sync()` is used to get the uid and pid of the requesting process. This function sends the unique D-Bus bus name of the requesting process to the `dbus-daemon`. If the requesting process disconnects just before the call, the `dbus-daemon` returns an error, but the function still returns `TRUE`, failing to indicate an error occurred and leading to an incorrect assumption that the uid of the requesting process is 0 (root).
    
**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write due to the lack of proper bounds checking on a user-controlled value (`internal.ndata`) used as an array index within the kernel.
*   **Credential check bypass:** In `polkit`, failure to check for errors returned by `polkit_system_bus_name_get_creds_sync` can lead to bypassing credential checks.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Integrity and System Availability:** The out-of-bounds write in the KVM API can lead to data corruption or system crashes, threatening data integrity and system availability.
*   **Local privilege escalation:** The polkit vulnerability allows any local user to run Polkit method calls as if they were run by the root user, which can lead to data confidentiality and integrity issues.
*   **Privilege Elevation:** By calling specific D-Bus methods as if it were requested by root, a local attacker can perform administrative tasks, such as installing packages or creating new user accounts.

**4. Attack vectors:**

*   **Local attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a local, unprivileged user.
*  **KVM API misuse:** A malicious userspace application can misuse the KVM API by manipulating the `internal.ndata` value, causing the out-of-bounds write in the kernel.
* **D-Bus manipulation**: A malicious local user can disconnect from `dbus-daemon` just before polkit attempts to retrieve the user's credentials.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **Userspace process control:** For the KVM API vulnerability, the attacker needs the ability to execute code in a user-space application that can interact with the KVM API. For the polkit vulnerability, a local user needs to call certain D-Bus methods.
*   **Knowledge of KVM API or D-Bus mechanics:**  The attacker needs a way to manipulate the `internal.ndata` parameter (for the KVM vulnerability) or to manipulate the D-Bus connection (for the polkit vulnerability).

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Linux kernel versions prior to 5.12.
*   Red Hat indicates that their Enterprise Linux 8 was affected starting with RHEL 8.4.0.
*   Mitigation was not considered readily available at the time of discovery.
*   Patches were released to address the issues.
*   NetApp has acknowledged the vulnerability in its products that incorporate a vulnerable Linux kernel and indicates some of its products will not receive a fix.
