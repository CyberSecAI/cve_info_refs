Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-3113 (as referenced by pentest.com.tr)

**Root Cause:**
- The Netsia SEBA+ application's "Active Sessions" section allows HTTP requests without requiring a valid session cookie.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:**  The vulnerability stems from the lack of authentication checks when accessing the "Active Sessions" endpoint.
- **Information Disclosure:**  Due to the authentication bypass, session cookie information of active users can be extracted from the server's response.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can use a valid session cookie obtained from the "Active Sessions" endpoint to create a new user with administrative privileges by sending a crafted POST request to the `/authentication-server/user/add` endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the application by creating a new admin user.
- **Full Control:** The newly created admin user has full control over the application and can perform any administrative action.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to reach the application's web interface.
- The attacker does not need an existing account on the system to create a new one.
-  An active session of an admin user is required for the exploit to work successfully, otherwise a new user can't be added.

**Technical Details:**
1.  The attacker sends a `GET` request to `/session/list/allActiveSession`.
2.  The server responds with a list of active sessions, including session cookies.
3.  The attacker extracts a session cookie value of an admin user and crafts a `POST` request to `/authentication-server/user/add` with a JSON payload, adding a new user with admin privileges.
4. The attacker uses the credentials of the created user to gain access.

**Additional Information from Exploit-DB:**
- The exploit was discovered by Özkan Mustafa AKKUŞ.
- A Metasploit module was created for the exploit.
- The vulnerable application is identified as Netsia SEBA+ version <= 0.16.1.
- The exploit requires a username and password for the new admin account which can be specified using options, the password can be generated randomly.
- The Metasploit module checks for vulnerability before attempting to add a new user.
