Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3709:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of information gathering operations within the `apport` package, specifically in the `ubuntu.py` general hook. The hook attempts to include byte-compilation logs for `emacs` related reports. It extracts the file path from a log file using a regex and attaches it to the report, without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** The vulnerability allows a local attacker to read arbitrary files on the system. This is due to the fact that the file path to be attached to the crash report is extracted from the log file, which is user controlled, with no sanitization.
- **Lack of Input Validation:**  The `apport` hook does not validate or sanitize the extracted file path, leading to the inclusion of sensitive files in crash reports.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized read access to sensitive files, potentially containing confidential information like `/etc/shadow` (which contains password hashes).

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local attacker can create a specially crafted crash report file that includes a malicious log entry specifying the path of the file to be attached to the report.
- When automatic crash reporting is enabled, `apport` will process this malicious crash report and attach the specified file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system to create crash report files.
- The attacker needs to know that `apport` includes the functionality to parse emacs compilation log file for attaching files to the report, or use a fuzzer to find the vulnerability.
- Automatic crash reporting must be enabled.
- The attacker needs to know which package to spoof to get the hook to trigger (in this case emacs22).

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves removing the code that attempts to include emacs byte-compilation logs, as these logs have not been generated by emacs packages for a long time.
- The vulnerability is triggered by the `DpkgTerminalLog` field in the crafted crash report.
- The vulnerability affects multiple Ubuntu releases, including 21.04, 20.04, 18.04, 16.04 ESM, and 14.04 ESM.
- This CVE was addressed in the USN-5077-1 and USN-5077-2 security notices.
- The bug report on launchpad also details the steps to reproduce the vulnerability and the fix.
