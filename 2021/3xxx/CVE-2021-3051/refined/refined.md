- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper verification of cryptographic signatures in Cortex XSOAR SAML authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The system fails to properly verify cryptographic signatures in SAML authentication, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can gain access to protected resources and perform unauthorized actions on the Cortex XSOAR server with administrator privileges. This includes the ability to perform administrative actions, create new integrations or users.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs specific knowledge of the Cortex XSOAR instance. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
