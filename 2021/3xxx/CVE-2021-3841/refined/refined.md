The provided content is related to the following vulnerabilities:

1. **SVG XSS Injection:** The commit addresses a vulnerability where malicious scripts could be injected through SVG files.
    - **Root Cause:** Insecure handling of uploaded SVG files, allowing embedded scripts to execute.
    - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
    - **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
    - **Attack Vectors:** Uploading a crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript code.
    - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to upload SVG files to the system.

2. **Clickjacking:** The commit mitigates the risk of clickjacking attacks.
    - **Root Cause:** The application was vulnerable to being embedded in an iframe without proper protection.
    - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Clickjacking vulnerability.
    - **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could trick a user into performing unintended actions by overlaying the application interface with a malicious one within an iframe.
    - **Attack Vectors:** Embedding the vulnerable application within an iframe on a malicious site.
    - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to control a webpage that can embed an iframe and potentially trick users to interact with the crafted page.

3. **Cache Control Issues:** The commit addresses a vulnerability related to caching configurations.
   - **Root Cause:**  The application did not properly set cache control directives for admin and customer account sections.
    - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Information disclosure vulnerability.
    - **Impact of Exploitation:** After logging out, a user could potentially use the browser's back button to access sensitive information due to improper caching, bypassing logout.
    - **Attack Vectors:** Logging out and then using the browser's back button.
    - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user.

This commit introduces several changes to address the issues. Specifically:
- **SVG XSS:** The commit implements sanitization of SVG files, likely stripping or escaping script tags to prevent execution.
- **Clickjacking:** The commit adds the `X-Frame-Options` header set to `sameorigin` to prevent the application from being embedded in an iframe from different domains.
- **Cache Control:** The commit sets `no-store`, `no-cache`, `max-age=0`, and `must-revalidate` cache control headers for admin and customer account sections to prevent caching of sensitive pages after logout.

The commit also includes additional testing to confirm the effectiveness of these fixes, and updates the dependency `enshrined/svg-sanitize`.
