Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2021-3864:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how the `dumpable` flag is managed when SUID (Set User ID) or SGID (Set Group ID) binaries execute descendant processes.
*   Specifically, if a SUID/SGID binary sets the real UID equal to the effective UID and the real GID equal to the effective GID, the descendant process can have its `dumpable` flag set to 1 (SUID_DUMP_USER). This allows a core dump to be generated, even when normally suid binaries are not allowed to produce coredumps, potentially leading to privilege escalation if exploited by an attacker.
*   The core issue is that the system doesn't adequately consider the security implications of a descendant process inheriting this dumpable status from a SUID/SGID parent, particularly after the child's privileges have been modified via setuid(0)/setgid(0) syscalls.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized core dumps to be written to arbitrary directories.
*   **Inadequate privilege separation:** SUID binaries don't have sufficient control over the `dumpable` flag of their descendants, and the system doesn't enforce correct dumpable behavior on suid programs.
*   **Relative core_pattern:** The use of a relative `core_pattern` in the system configuration makes the exploit more feasible since the core dump file is created in a predictable location (`/etc/logrotate.d`).
*   **Unprotected signal handling:** the lack of restrictions on signals like SIGQUIT, which triggers coredumps makes the vulnerability easier to exploit.
*   **Abuse of RLIMIT_CORE and PR_SET_DUMPABLE:** the ability to modify these settings allows the exploit to override the `not-dumpable` protection mechanism.
*   **Environment Variables Abuse**: the attacker could insert a logrotate config through environment variables inherited by the children of suid binaries, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation (LPE):** An unprivileged local user can exploit the vulnerability to place core dumps into root-owned directories. The user can then leverage the dumped data, specifically by creating configuration files to use with logrotate, to get arbitrary code execution as root, leading to privilege escalation.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By manipulating the coredump contents and the logrotate configuration, an attacker can cause code specified within the coredump to execute with elevated privileges.
*  **Compromise of System Security:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the system.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **SUID/SGID Binary Execution:** The attacker must be able to execute a SUID/SGID binary.
*   **Core dump trigger:** The attacker must be able to cause a core dump either by resource limits (RLIMIT_CPU) or by sending SIGQUIT to the terminal and, thus, to the process group of the parent, resulting in the coredump of a child process of a suid process.
*   **Relative `core_pattern`:** The system must have a relative `core_pattern`, which allows the core dump to be placed in a user specified location.
*   **Specific SUID/SGID binaries:** Exploiting this vulnerability requires a binary that uses execve after calling setuid(0) and setgid(0).

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privilege User:**  The attacker needs a regular user account with access to the system.
*  **Execution Rights:** The attacker needs to be able to execute a vulnerable SUID/SGID binary on the targeted system. For example, `sudo` or `su` are identified as vulnerable binaries.
*   **Ability to control environment variables**: The attacker must have some control over environment variables that the SUID binary will pass to its children
*   **Working Directory Control:** The ability to set the working directory for sudo, su or similar binary.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Affected Systems:** Ubuntu 21.04, Debian 11, and CentOS 7 (with modifications) have been specifically mentioned as vulnerable. Other Linux distributions with similar configuration defaults could also be susceptible.
*   **Exploitation techniques:**
    *   Setting the RLIMIT_CPU to 0 in the parent process to crash child processes after execve.
    *   Using a forked process to send SIGQUIT signal to a SUID child process.
*   **Workarounds:**
    *   Setting `core_pattern` to an absolute path.
    *   Adding `pam_limits.so` to sudo PAM configuration and setting RLIMIT_CORE to 0.
*   **Kernel-level fix:** A Linux kernel fix is suggested that would reset `RLIMIT_CORE` to 0 for all SUID/SGID processes, but this was deemed as potentially disruptive to users.
*   **Proposed Kernel Fixes:**
   *   Adding `MMF_NOT_DUMPABLE` flag to processes created via `suidexec` and only clearing it if `prctl(PR_SET_DUMPABLE)` is used or if RLIMIT_CORE is changed.
   * Adding a `PF_SUID` flag and then checking for this flag along with CAP_SYS_ADMIN, root directory ownership, and non-world writable directory to determine if dumping is permitted.

The content also highlights the need for a robust solution within the kernel itself, and proposes various approaches to address the root of the problem, while mitigating the risk of privilege escalation from abusing coredump generation on SUID/SGID binaries.
