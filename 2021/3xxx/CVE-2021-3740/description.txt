A Session Fixation vulnerability exists in chatwoot/chatwoot versions prior to 2.4.0. The application does not invalidate existing sessions on other devices when a user changes their password, allowing old sessions to persist. This can lead to unauthorized access if an attacker has obtained a session token.
