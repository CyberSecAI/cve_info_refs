Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-3604

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection flaw found in the authentication module of the Primion-Digitek EVALOS Secure 8 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application's authentication module is vulnerable to Blind SQL injection. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject SQL queries and infer information based on the application's responses. Specifically, the application responds differently to specific payloads indicating that the input is being injected into the SQL query, but does not reveal the query output directly.
- **Insecure Password Storage:** The application stores passwords as SHA-1 hashes. This can be cracked relatively quickly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Extraction:** An attacker can extract user credentials (usernames and SHA-1 password hashes) and potentially other sensitive data stored in the database by exploiting the Blind SQL Injection.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successfully cracked passwords allow the attacker to gain access to the application.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Once inside the system, an attacker can modify access permissions, create new users, revoke access from existing users, and gain control over critical areas within the facility.
- **Compromised Physical Security:** Exploitation can lead to the compromise of physical security of critical infrastructures. An attacker can use the application to bypass access controls and gain access to restricted areas.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based attack:** The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious SQL code into the login form of the administrative interface.
- **Authentication bypass:** Attackers bypass the authentication using SQL injection techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the system hosting the vulnerable application.
- The attacker requires a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques and how to construct blind SQL injection payloads.
- No prior authentication is required to attempt the exploitation of the vulnerability.
