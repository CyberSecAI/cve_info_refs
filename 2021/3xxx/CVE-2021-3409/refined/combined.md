Debian Bug     : 984450 984451 984452 984448 984449 970937

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in QEMU, a fast processor
emulator.

CVE-2021-20257

    net: e1000: infinite loop while processing transmit descriptors

CVE-2021-20255

    A stack overflow via an infinite recursion vulnerability was found in the
    eepro100 i8255x device emulator of QEMU. This issue occurs while processing
    controller commands due to a DMA reentry issue. This flaw allows a guest
    user or process to consume CPU cycles or crash the QEMU process on the
    host, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2021-20203

    An integer overflow issue was found in the vmxnet3 NIC emulator of the
    QEMU. It may occur if a guest was to supply invalid values for rx/tx queue
    size or other NIC parameters. A privileged guest user may use this flaw to
    crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.

CVE-2021-3416

    A potential stack overflow via infinite loop issue was found in various NIC
    emulators of QEMU in versions up to and including 5.2.0. The issue occurs
    in loopback mode of a NIC wherein reentrant DMA checks get bypassed. A
    guest user/process may use this flaw to consume CPU cycles or crash the
    QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.

CVE-2021-3416

    The patch for CVE-2020-17380/CVE-2020-25085 was found to be ineffective,
    thus making QEMU vulnerable to the out-of-bounds read/write access issues
    previously found in the SDHCI controller emulation code. This flaw allows a
    malicious privileged guest to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting
    in a denial of service or potential code execution.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
1:2.8+dfsg-6+deb9u14.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.

For the detailed security status of qemu please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/qemu>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## [RESEND PATCH v3 0/5] hw/sd: sdhci: Fixes to CVE-2020-17380, CVE-2020-25

```
This series includes several fixes to CVE-2020-17380, CVE-2020-25085
and CVE-2021-3409 that are heap-based buffer overflow issues existing
in the sdhci model.

These CVEs are pretty much similar, and were filed using different
reproducers. With this series, current known reproducers I have
cannot be reproduced any more.

The implementation of this model still has some issues, e.g.: some codes
do not seem to strictly match the spec, but since this series only aimes
to address CVEs, such issue should be fixed in a separate series in the
future, if I have time :)

Changes in v3 RESEND:
- Drop the duplicated SoB email address

Changes in v3:
- Embed the reproducer in the commit message

Changes in v2:
- new patch: sdhci: Limit block size only when SDHC_BLKSIZE register is writable
- new patch: sdhci: Reset the data pointer of s->fifo_buffer[] when a different
block size is programmed

Bin Meng (5):
  hw/sd: sdhci: Don't transfer any data when command time out
  hw/sd: sdhci: Don't write to SDHC_SYSAD register when transfer is in
    progress
  hw/sd: sdhci: Correctly set the controller status for ADMA
  hw/sd: sdhci: Limit block size only when SDHC_BLKSIZE register is
    writable
  hw/sd: sdhci: Reset the data pointer of s->fifo_buffer[] when a
    different block size is programmed

Subject: CVE-2021-3409 QEMU: sdhci: incomplete fix for CVE-2020-17380/CVE-2020-25085

Hello,

QEMU upstream commit [1] was supposed to fix CVE-2020-17380 and
CVE-2020-25085, both involving a heap buffer overflow in the SDHCI
controller emulation code. In fact, commit [1] turned out to be
incomplete, in that it was still possible to reproduce the same
issue(s) with specially crafted input, inducing a bogus transfer and
subsequent out-of-bounds read/write access in sdhci_do_adma() or
sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks().

A new series has been proposed (not merged yet) to address those
issues, and CVE-2021-3409 was assigned to facilitate
tracking/backporting of the new patch.

Old patch:
[1] <https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=dfba99f17feb6d4a129da19d38df1bcd8579d1c3>

New patch series:
<https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2021-03/msg00949.html>

CVE-2021-3409 assigned by Red Hat, Inc.

Best regards.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
