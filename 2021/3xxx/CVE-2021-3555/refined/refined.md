- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A pre-authentication buffer overflow exists in the RTSP server on the local network of the Eufy 2K Indoor Camera.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability can potentially allow an attacker to gain control of the device. The provided information doesn't elaborate on the extent of control, but implies that successful exploitation leads to complete control.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable through the RTSP server, which is exposed on the local network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be on the local network. The vulnerable authentication method also needs to be enabled, though it is disabled by default.
