{
  "CVE-2021-3447": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in several ansible modules, where parameters containing credentials, such as secrets, were being logged in plain-text on managed nodes, as well as being made visible on the controller node when run in verbose mode. These parameters were not protected by the no_log feature. An attacker can take advantage of this information to steal those credentials, provided when they have access to the log files containing them. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize and mask sensitive parameters, such as credentials, within Ansible modules. Specifically, these parameters, intended to be protected by the no_log feature, were still being exposed in plain text in log files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate sanitization of sensitive data",
      "Failure to properly implement the 'no_log' feature",
      "Exposure of sensitive information in logs"
    ],
    "Impact": "The primary impact is the potential exposure of sensitive information, such as credentials, which could lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and other security compromises.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker with access to the Ansible logs on either the managed nodes or the controller can extract the exposed sensitive information.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs access to the log files generated during Ansible playbook executions. This access could be gained through compromised systems, unauthorized access to log storage, or other methods of gaining access to system logs."
