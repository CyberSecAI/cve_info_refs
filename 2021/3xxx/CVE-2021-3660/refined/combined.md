| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1992149#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-08-10 16:30:23 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Cockpit in the way it handles the certificate verification performed by SSSD and allows client certificates to successfully authenticate regardless of the CRL configuration or the certificate status.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1992149#c4)  gkamathe    2021-08-17 16:33:02 UTC  ``` (1) This is not currently a supported use case. The documentation [0] warns that cockpit doesn't do any meaningful verification of the certificate (it does reject expired ones, but no CA/CRL). This behaviour is not a secret, so it might be beneficial to make this unembargoed, to have a pointer for other affected users.  (2) Fixing this properly requires adding a validation D-Bus API to sssd [1]. I filed [bug 1992432](show_bug.cgi?id=1992432 "CLOSED ERRATA - Add client certificate validation D-Bus API (dependency of cockpit CVE-2021-3698 fix)") for tracking this.  [0] <https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/cert-authentication.html> [1] <https://github.com/SSSD/sssd/issues/5224>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1992149#c7)  Sandipan Roy    2021-08-27 12:49:25 UTC  ``` Created cockpit tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1998513](show_bug.cgi?id=1998513 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2021-3698 cockpit: authenticates with revoked certificates [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1992149#c8)  Sandro Bonazzola    2021-08-27 13:15:40 UTC  ``` Is this going to be fixed for RHEL 7? I'm asking because we got a tracker opened on RHV-M 4.3 ([bug #1993783](show_bug.cgi?id=1993783) ) which is cross-shipping cockpit from RHEL 7 and if it's not going to be fixed there we should close it as well for RHV-M.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1992149#c9)  Martin Pitt    2021-08-27 14:35:39 UTC  ``` Sandro: No, it does not affect RHEL 7, the certificate auth functionality is RHEL 8/9 only (introduced in version 208, and RHEL 7 has Cockpit 195).   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1992149#c11)  Martin Pitt    2021-12-09 15:08:35 UTC  ``` With sssd 2.6.1 now being available in at least Fedora 35 and Debian testing, I worked on using this new API in Cockpit: <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/16703>  This includes integration tests and documentation, and falling back to the pre-2.6.1 API (where only full binary matching is supported). Review much appreciated!  Thanks again to the sssd team, in particular Iker Pedrosa, for adding the validation API!  As this breaks existing systems on upgrades, I add Lucie to CC: you now *have* to configure a CA in sssd for cert logins to work, and unfortunately `realm join` does not do this automatically for IPA. The upstream release note (in the PR, going to be in the release blog) and the upstream docs (once the PR lands) have the details.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1992149#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-05-10 14:53:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2022:2008 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:2008](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A2008)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1992149#c15)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-05-11 07:46:54 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2021-3698>   ``` |  |

### @martinpitt **[martinpitt](/martinpitt)** commented [Sep 13, 2021](#issue-994680256) • edited by garrett Loading

Declare `X-Frame-Options: sameorigin` [1] so that cockpit frames can

only be embedded into pages coming from the same origin. This is similar

to setting CORP in commit [2b38b8d](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/commit/2b38b8de92f9aadb957b4c4251e6e49ef848e2f2) (which applies to `<script>`,

`<img>`, etc.).

The main use case for embedding is to run cockpit-ws behind a reverse

proxy, while also serving other pages. Cross-origin embedding is

discouraged these days to prevent "clickjacking".

Cross-origin embedding already did not work in practice, due to our

cookie restrictions: Frames would always just show the login page.

However, this looks confusing and is unclean. With X-Frame-Options, the

browser instead shows an explanatory error page.

Mention the same origin requirement in the embedding documentation.

Fixes [#16122](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/issues/16122)

---

* Get working reproducer from [security bz reporter](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1980688) that this was not actually exploitable with cross-origins from different IPs/host names
* Update [documentation](https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/embedding.html) that embedding only works for same-origin frames
* Set `X-Frame-Options: sameorigin` as a third line of defence
* builds on top of [various fixes/improvements to testing embedding and reverse proxying #16346](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/16346)
* fix `test-httpstream` to be robust against header hash ordering: PR [bridge: Robust JSON object comparison in test-httpstream.c #16348](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/16348)

## Webserver: Restrict frame embedding to same origin

Cockpit's web server now sets the [X-Frame-Options header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options) to explicitly disallow frame embedding within a different origin. Thanks to cookie policy restrictions, this was already prevented in most cases, as embedded frames would always show the login page. With this new option, the browser directly forbids cross-origin embedding and shows an explanatory error page instead.

| Darn, when writing the `STATIC_HEADERS_CHUNKED` hack I already had a hunch that assuming glib hash ordering would backfire -- and [it did](https://logs.cockpit-project.org/logs/pull-16342-20210914-072625-784e2518-rhel-8-5/log.html).  I filed PR [#16346](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/16346) to land the test/example fixes, and will rework test-httpstream to be more robust against header changes. |

| I tried very hard again today to actually exploit this, but still did not get very far. I now left the description sufficiently vague, and I think this is ready to land despite not having fully confirmed the original scenario. See <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c19> for details.  [@mvollmer](https://github.com/mvollmer), want to have a look? |

This reproduces the scenario in #16122. Try to load a cockpit frame from
a different domain (localhost:12346, from a local python web server),
and ensure that this does not work beyond the login page. We really want
it to refuse to load the frame at all, but as we currently don't set
`X-Frame-Options:`, this currently does work, in both Chromium and
Firefox.

But make sure that the default browser/cookie policy prevents loading
the frame and leaking credentials. This test only works in Firefox, as
Chromium's CDP driver does not even expose cross-origin frames (even
though the browser itself does show them).")`

`[common: Restrict frame embedding to same origin](/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/16342/commits/25a8a5c6e47268933b9b4433a9590ccfd9c04c83 "common: Restrict frame embedding to same origin

Declare `X-Frame-Options: sameorigin` [1] so that cockpit frames can
only be embedded into pages coming from the same origin. This is similar
to setting CORP in commit 2b38b8de92f9a (which applies to `<script>`,
`<img>`, etc.).

The main use case for embedding is to run cockpit-ws behind a reverse
proxy, while also serving other pages. Cross-origin embedding is
discouraged these days to prevent \"clickjacking\".

Cross-origin embedding already did not work in most cases: Frames would
always just show the login page.  However, this looks confusing and is
unclean. With X-Frame-Options, the browser instead shows an explanatory
error page.

Mention the same origin requirement in the embedding documentation.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

common: Restrict frame embedding to same origin

```
Declare `X-Frame-Options: sameorigin` [1] so that cockpit frames can
only be embedded into pages coming from the same origin. This is similar
to setting CORP in commit [2b38b8d](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/commit/2b38b8de92f9aadb957b4c4251e6e49ef848e2f2) (which applies to `<script>`,
`<img>`, etc.).

The main use case for embedding is to run cockpit-ws behind a reverse
proxy, while also serving other pages. Cross-origin embedding is
discouraged these days to prevent "clickjacking".

Cross-origin embedding already did not work in most cases: Frames would
always just show the login page.  However, this looks confusing and is
unclean. With X-Frame-Options, the browser instead shows an explanatory
error page.

Mention the same origin requirement in the embedding documentation.

| Through a security scan, I was notified:  *The remote web server does not set an X-Frame-Options response header or a Content-Security-Policy 'frame-ancestors' response header in all content responses. This could potentially expose the site to a clickjacking or UI redress attack, in which an attacker can trick a user into clicking an area of the vulnerable page that is different than what the user perceives the page to be. This can result in a user performing fraudulent or malicious transactions.*  Suggested solution is:  Return the X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy (with the 'frame-ancestors' directive) HTTP header with the page's response.  Is there a way to do this through the config in cockpit? or is there some other reason it is not subject to clickjacking?  Downstream bug: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1980688> (plus a few dependent ones for the individual packages in Fedora and RHEL 8/9) |

| You are already the second person to report this recently. Apparently embedding [as we document it](https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/embedding.html) is not en vogue any more..  We could default to [X-Frame-Options: sameorigin](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options) (which should at least retain the reverse-proxy case, like in Foreman), and provide an option in cockpit.conf to open it up further. |

| I think your proposal sounds reasonable. I am not an expert in the security, just received the scan result, and wanted to know how to remove the security risk. Is there a way to set X-frame-options:same origin in Cockpit version 238? I am using cockpit on RHEL8.4, and then adding a few pages for additional capabilities specific to my application... I was surprised to see security scan failures reported from cockpit. |

| I tried to run `python3 -m http.server` in <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/tree/main/test/verify/files/embed-cockpit> , and opened <http://localhost:8000> . I select <http://127.0.0.1:9090> in the input line, then "full server", and try to log in. PAM works, but the web page immediately goes back to the login screen without an error message. I tested this on RHEL 8.4, 8.5, and Fedora 34.  Embedding currently works as part of a cockpit web page (like on embed-cockpit example) for the *same* domain -- but as soon as I choose a different one like 127.0.0.2:9091 (our test VMs), it fails:  Content Security Policy: The page’s settings blocked the loading of a resource at [http://127.0.0.2:9091/cockpit/@localhost/system/terminal.html](http://127.0.0.2:9091/cockpit/%40localhost/system/terminal.html) (“default-src”).  All our Cockpit pages have this relatively strict C-S-P.  It looks like embedding cockpit across different origins silently broke some unknown time ago (whether this is due to new browser restrictions or some regression in cockpit-ws I can't say yet). So can you actually exploit this right now? I.e. embed a cockpit frame into a page from a different origin, and make it actually work? |

| See PR [#16342](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/16342), where I am currently investigating this, wrote test cases for both cases (same and cross origin), and will add the `X-Frame-Options`. However, I just can't for the life of me reproduce the bug that you can show authenticated cockpit frames on a different-origin page. I need some help with this, I also asked in <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c17> |

| I did not reproduce a bug.. I had the result of a Nessus scan, which showed the potential vulnerability in the report. My understanding is that it could allow the cockpit page to be loaded into an iframe and click jacking works by having an invisible page over the cockpit page to take the clicks instead of getting them to the cockpit page, which would allow them to perform malicious behaviors.  My purpose of opening this ticket is to find if this is a real vulnerability, and how to prevent it if it is. Nessus report shows: Web Application Potentially Vulnerable to Clickjacking Synopsis The remote web server may fail to mitigate a class of web application vulnerabilities.  Description The remote web server does not set an X-Frame-Options response header or a Content-Security-Policy 'frame-ancestors' response header in all content responses. This could potentially expose the site to a clickjacking or UI redress attack, in which an attacker can trick a user into clicking an area of the vulnerable page that is different than what the user perceives the page to be. This can result in a user performing fraudulent or malicious transactions.  X-Frame-Options has been proposed by Microsoft as a way to mitigate clickjacking attacks and is currently supported by all major browser vendors.  Content-Security-Policy (CSP) has been proposed by the W3C Web Application Security Working Group, with increasing support among all major browser vendors, as a way to mitigate clickjacking and other attacks. The 'frame-ancestors' policy directive restricts which sources can embed the protected resource.  Note that while the X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy response headers are not the only mitigations for clickjacking, they are currently the most reliable methods that can be detected through automation. Therefore, this plugin may produce false positives if other mitigation strategies (e.g., frame-busting JavaScript) are deployed or if the page does not perform any security-sensitive transactions.  See Also <http://www.nessus.org/u?399b1f56> <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking_Defense_Cheat_Sheet> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking>  Solution Return the X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy (with the 'frame-ancestors' directive) HTTP header with the page's response. This prevents the page's content from being rendered by another site when using the frame or iframe HTML tags.  Risk Factor Medium CVSS v2.0 Base Score 4.3 (CVSS2#AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P)  References  XREF CWE:693  Plugin Information Published: 2015/08/22, Modified: 2017/05/16  Plugin Output xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (tcp/9090)  The following pages do not use a clickjacking mitigation response header and contain a clickable event :   * <https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:9090/> |

| [@rrandecker](https://github.com/rrandecker) : Initially, 8.6/9.0 final. I am still investigating how much of an actual problem this is, i.e. whether we need to backport this to at least 8.5 as well.  As I mentioned, I am currently unable to get anything else besides the login page when doing a cross-domain frame embedding (which would be "harmless enough" IMHO, albeit a bit confusing). However, judging by <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1980688> it is likely that I am missing something. |

| [@rrandecker](https://github.com/rrandecker): I just made <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c25> public with some details. In short, the `SameSite: strict` cookie policy from commit [46f6839](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/commit/46f6839d1af4e662648a85f3e54bba2d57f39f0e) (aka cockpit 236) addressed most of this, so in an embedded frame from a different host name/IP address you can only ever get the login page, no authenticated frames. IMHO this mitigates most of the "interesting" aspects of clickjacking.  That means that this only works in RHEL ≤ 8.3, but RHEL 8.4+ is mostly safe already. |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c0)  Cedric Buissart    2021-07-09 09:25:56 UTC  ``` Cockpit (and its plugins) do not seem to protect itself against clickjacking : it is possible to render a page from a cockpit server via another website, inside an <iFrame> HTML entry.  This may be used by a malicious website in clickjacking, or similar, attacks.   To prevent this behavior, a X-Frame-Options header could be added to the responses.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c2)  Martin Pitt    2021-07-09 09:56:58 UTC  ``` You mean you can embed a Cockpit iframe into other web pages? That's actually explicitly documented/supported: <https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/embedding.html>  If I understand you correctly, you want to disable that (at least by default)? If embedding is not en vogue any more, we could default to "X-Frame-Options: sameorigin" [1] (which should at least retain the reverse-proxy case, like in Foreman/Satellite), and provide an option in cockpit.conf to open it up further?   [1] <https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c3)  Cedric Buissart    2021-07-09 11:45:05 UTC  ``` The behavior triggers warnings on Web testing tools (e.g.: Burp Suite).  The issue comes from the fact that a malicious site may target a user known to be logged in cockpit, by, for example, hiding a cockpit page in a transparent frame, which might be clicked on by the user.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c4)  Cedric Buissart    2021-07-20 08:29:43 UTC  ``` Hello Martin,  Yes, I think limiting the range of pages accessible via iFrames might be a good thing. At first sight, the attacks are very limited, since cockpit uses Web Sockets rather than GET/POST, but it might still be doable to do things like temporarily disable SELinux, since that button is accessible from a single click.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c5)  Martin Pitt    2021-07-22 04:38:03 UTC  ``` Cedric: We'll investigate this. However, this is already public in pretty much the widest possible way: It is documented upstream [1], as a corresponding upstream issue [2], and has existed for many years. Does it make sense to keep this embargoed? If not, can this become a normal public bug against cockpit in RHEL 8?  [1] <https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/embedding.html> [2] <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/issues/16122>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c6)  Cedric Buissart    2021-07-22 08:58:59 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c5): > Cedric: We'll investigate this. However, this is already public in pretty > much the widest possible way: It is documented upstream [1], as a > corresponding upstream issue [2], and has existed for many years. Does it > make sense to keep this embargoed?  No, indeed, it doesn't. I am making it public  > If not, can this become a normal public bug against cockpit in RHEL 8? However, I think this warrants a CVE, as other Web applications have been treated similarly (recent examples : Jenkins & Kibana). This bug will be the generic flaw bug, describing the vulnerability, and I will open a tracker bug dedicated to RHEL-8 separately.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c9)  Cedric Buissart    2021-07-22 12:57:02 UTC  ``` Created cockpit tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1984907](show_bug.cgi?id=1984907 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2021-3660 cockpit: pages vulnerable to clickjacking [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c13)  Sandro Bonazzola    2021-09-02 07:10:14 UTC  ``` Is this affecting also RHEL 7?   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c14)  Martin Pitt    2021-09-02 07:16:42 UTC  ``` Yes, the embedding feature has been in cockpit since pretty much day one.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c17)  Martin Pitt    2021-09-13 13:30:12 UTC  ``` @cbuissar I looked into this more deeply now in <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/16342> . I first created a test which ensures that same-origin frame embedding actually works outside of the cockpit web server [1]. That's the case which we care about, which we want to support (and I think there is no contention here). Before, we only tested frame embedding inside of a cockpit session [2], which is not a realistic use case.  As I mentioned above, I have a hard time to actually get a cross-origin cockpit frame to work. I tested this with Chromium 90.0.4430 and Firefox 92.0, with your reproducer and with our test setup, and due to the "SameSite: strict" cookie policy, cross-origin frames don't retain authentication and thus I keep getting the login page. I wrote another test case for this [4] which gets the same result (it also illustrates that and where it should really fail, with setting X-Frame-Options:).  I would really like to understand *if* and *how* you were able to do this (as you wrote a reproducer). Did you actually see the authenticated pages, or just the login page? If the former, what exact browser, OS, cockpit version did you use? Where did you run cockpit, same or different machine as your file:/// reproducer?  Thanks!

However, for evaluating the impact/backporting to stable releases etc., I'm still interested in whether this was really exploitable before, or you just saw the login page. Thanks!   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c23)  Sandro Bonazzola    2021-09-17 14:28:02 UTC  ``` (In reply to Martin Pitt from [comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c14)) > Yes, the embedding feature has been in cockpit since pretty much day one.  Shouldn't we have a tracker for RHEL 7 here as well then?   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c25)  Martin Pitt    2021-09-20 06:44:54 UTC  ``` Cedric: Ah-aa! thanks for the screenshot. Your target system was RHEL 8.3, I only tried with 8.4, 8.5, and Fedora. 8.3 still had a non-strict cookie policy, which got tightened in [bug 1891944](show_bug.cgi?id=1891944 "CLOSED ERRATA - cockpit SameSite cookie attribute not present in Set-Cookie responses") / <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/commit/46f6839d1af4e6> . That's the bit which prevents sending the login cookie through cross-origin frames, and mitigates most of the actual fallout here.  I can reproduce this with file:// now, with Firefox against the current RHEL 8.3 cloud image:      qemu-system-x86_64 -cpu host -enable-kvm -nographic -m 2048 -drive file=rhel-guest-image-8.3-401.x86_64.qcow2,if=virtio -snapshot -cdrom cloud-init.iso -net nic,model=virtio -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2201-:22,hostfwd=tcp::9999-:9090  So indeed this only really affects Cockpit < 236, i.e. RHEL 8.3 and below. Of course setting XFO should still be done (and we'll land that).   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c26)  Sandro Bonazzola    2021-09-23 07:00:47 UTC  ``` (In reply to Martin Pitt from [comment #25](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c25))  > So indeed this only really affects Cockpit < 236, i.e. RHEL 8.3 and below. > Of course setting XFO should still be done (and we'll land that).

common: Restrict frame embedding to same origin

```
Declare `X-Frame-Options: sameorigin` [1] so that cockpit frames can
only be embedded into pages coming from the same origin. This is similar
to setting CORP in commit [2b38b8d](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/commit/2b38b8de92f9aadb957b4c4251e6e49ef848e2f2) (which applies to `<script>`,
`<img>`, etc.).

The main use case for embedding is to run cockpit-ws behind a reverse
proxy, while also serving other pages. Cross-origin embedding is
discouraged these days to prevent "clickjacking".

Cross-origin embedding already did not work in most cases: Frames would
always just show the login page.  However, this looks confusing and is
unclean. With X-Frame-Options, the browser instead shows an explanatory
error page.

Mention the same origin requirement in the embedding documentation.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

### Plans & Pricing

#### What are the differences between the Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Pro is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### How can I upgrade my GitHub Copilot Free license to Copilot Pro?

If you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your [Copilot settings page](https://github.com/settings/copilot) or directly on the [Copilot marketing page](https://github.com/features/copilot).

#### What is included in GitHub Copilot Free?

GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1792270#c0)  Renaud Métrich    2020-01-17 12:50:20 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Under the Services panel, there should be a "User Services" tab that shows the systemd user instance running on the system for the user currently logged in (including the root user, "root" also has a systemd user instance). This would be very convenient for the user to manage his own services.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  cockpit-ws-196.3-1.el8.x86_64   Additional info:  In a shell, the systemd user instance is available through this command:  $ systemctl --user ...   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1792270#c1)  Matej Marušák    2020-01-19 15:34:21 UTC  ``` Also tracked in upstream <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/issues/13217>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1792270#c11)  Katerina Koukiou    2021-11-09 15:43:37 UTC  ``` Upstream PR <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/16545>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1792270#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-05-10 15:18:37 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory (Moderate: cockpit security, bug fix, and enhancement update), and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.  [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:2008](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A2008)   ``` |  |

# X-Frame-Options

**Veraltet:** Diese Funktion wird nicht mehr empfohlen. Obwohl einige Browser sie mÃ¶glicherweise noch unterstÃ¼tzen, kÃ¶nnte sie bereits aus den relevanten Webstandards entfernt worden sein, in KÃ¼rze entfernt werden oder nur noch aus KompatibilitÃ¤tsgrÃ¼nden bestehen. Vermeiden Sie die Verwendung und aktualisieren Sie vorhandenen Code, falls mÃ¶glich; siehe die [KompatibilitÃ¤tstabelle](#browser-kompatibilitÃ¤t) am Ende dieser Seite, um Ihre Entscheidung zu unterstÃ¼tzen. Beachten Sie, dass diese Funktion jederzeit aufhÃ¶ren kÃ¶nnte zu funktionieren.

**Warnung:**
Anstatt dieses Headers verwenden Sie die [`frame-ancestors`](/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors)-Direktive in einem [`Content-Security-Policy`](/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy)-Header.

Der HTTP **`X-Frame-Options`** [Antwort-Header](/de/docs/Glossary/Response_header) kann verwendet werden, um anzugeben, ob ein Browser eine Seite in einem [`<frame>`](/de/docs/Web/HTML/Element/frame), [`<iframe>`](/de/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe), [`<embed>`](/de/docs/Web/HTML/Element/embed) oder [`<object>`](/de/docs/Web/HTML/Element/object) rendern darf. Websites kÃ¶nnen dies nutzen, um [Clickjacking](/de/docs/Web/Security/Types_of_attacks#clickjacking)-Angriffe zu vermeiden, indem sie sicherstellen, dass ihre Inhalte nicht in andere Seiten eingebettet werden.

Die zusÃ¤tzliche Sicherheit wird nur bereitgestellt, wenn der Benutzer, der auf das Dokument zugreift, einen Browser verwendet, der `X-Frame-Options` unterstÃ¼tzt.

| Header-Typ | [Antwort-Header](/de/docs/Glossary/Response_header) |
| --- | --- |
| [Verbotener Header-Name](/de/docs/Glossary/Forbidden_header_name) | Nein |

## [Syntax](#syntax)

Es gibt zwei mÃ¶gliche Direktiven fÃ¼r `X-Frame-Options`:

http
```
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN

```
### [Direktiven](#direktiven)

Wenn Sie `DENY` angeben, wird der Versuch des Browsers, die Seite in einem Frame zu laden, nicht nur beim Laden von anderen Seiten fehlschlagen, sondern auch beim Laden von derselben Seite. Wenn Sie hingegen `SAMEORIGIN` angeben, kÃ¶nnen Sie die Seite weiterhin in einem Frame verwenden, solange die Seite, die sie in einem Frame einfÃ¼gt, dieselbe ist wie diejenige, die die Seite bereitstellt.

[`DENY`](#deny)

Die Seite kann in keinem Frame angezeigt werden, unabhÃ¤ngig von der Seite, die es versucht.

[`SAMEORIGIN`
Veraltet](#sameorigin)

Die Seite kann nur angezeigt werden, wenn alle Ã¼bergeordneten Frames denselben Ursprung wie die Seite selbst haben.

[`ALLOW-FROM origin`
Veraltet](#allow-from_origin)

Dies ist eine veraltete Direktive. Moderne Browser, die Antwort-Header mit dieser Direktive vorfinden, ignorieren den Header vollstÃ¤ndig. Der [`Content-Security-Policy`](/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) HTTP-Header hat eine [`frame-ancestors`](/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors)-Direktive, die Sie stattdessen verwenden sollten.

## [Beispiele](#beispiele)

**Warnung:**
Das Setzen von `X-Frame-Options` innerhalb des [`<meta>`](/de/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta)-Elements (z.B. `<meta http-equiv="X-Frame-Options" content="deny">`) hat keine Wirkung. `X-Frame-Options` wird nur Ã¼ber HTTP-Header erzwungen, wie in den folgenden Beispielen gezeigt.

### [Konfiguration von Apache](#konfiguration_von_apache)

Um Apache so zu konfigurieren, dass der `X-Frame-Options`-Header fÃ¼r alle Seiten gesendet wird, fÃ¼gen Sie dies zur Konfiguration Ihrer Website hinzu:

apacheconf
```
Header always set X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"

```

Um Apache so zu konfigurieren, dass `X-Frame-Options` auf `DENY` gesetzt wird, fÃ¼gen Sie dies zur Konfiguration Ihrer Website hinzu:

apacheconf
```
Header set X-Frame-Options "DENY"

```
### [Konfiguration von Nginx](#konfiguration_von_nginx)

Um Nginx so zu konfigurieren, dass der `X-Frame-Options`-Header gesendet wird, fÃ¼gen Sie dies entweder zu Ihrer http-, server- oder location-Konfiguration hinzu:

nginx
```
add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN always;

```

Sie kÃ¶nnen den `X-Frame-Options`-Header auf `DENY` setzen, indem Sie:

nginx
```
add_header X-Frame-Options DENY always;

```
### [Konfiguration von IIS](#konfiguration_von_iis)

Um IIS so zu konfigurieren, dass der `X-Frame-Options`-Header gesendet wird, fÃ¼gen Sie dies zur Datei `Web.config` Ihrer Website hinzu:

xml
```
<system.webServer>
  â¦
  <httpProtocol>
    <customHeaders>
      <add name="X-Frame-Options" value="SAMEORIGIN" />
    </customHeaders>
  </httpProtocol>
  â¦
</system.webServer>

```

FÃ¼r weitere Informationen lesen Sie den [Microsoft Support-Artikel zur Einstellung dieser Konfiguration mit der IIS Manager-BenutzeroberflÃ¤che](https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/office/mitigating-framesniffing-with-the-x-frame-options-header-1911411b-b51e-49fd-9441-e8301dcdcd79).

### [Konfiguration von HAProxy](#konfiguration_von_haproxy)

Um HAProxy so zu konfigurieren, dass der `X-Frame-Options`-Header gesendet wird, fÃ¼gen Sie dies Ihrer Frontend-, Listener- oder Backend-Konfiguration hinzu:

```
rspadd X-Frame-Options:\ SAMEORIGIN

```

Alternativ, in neueren Versionen:

```
http-response set-header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN

```
### [Konfiguration von Express](#konfiguration_von_express)

Um `X-Frame-Options` auf `SAMEORIGIN` zu setzen, verwenden Sie [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/) und fÃ¼gen Sie das Folgende zu Ihrer Server-Konfiguration hinzu:

js
```
const helmet = require("helmet");
const app = express();
app.use(
  helmet({
    xFrameOptions: { action: "sameorigin" },
  }),
);

```

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# X-Frame-Options

**Deprecated:** This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

**Warning:**
Instead of this header, use the [`frame-ancestors`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors) directive in a [`Content-Security-Policy`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) header.

The HTTP **`X-Frame-Options`** [response header](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header) can be used to indicate whether a browser should be allowed to render a page in a [`<frame>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/frame), [`<iframe>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe), [`<embed>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/embed) or [`<object>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/object). Sites can use this to avoid [clickjacking](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Types_of_attacks#clickjacking) attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites.

The added security is provided only if the user accessing the document is using a browser that supports `X-Frame-Options`.

| Header type | [Response header](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header) |
| --- | --- |
| [Forbidden header name](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Forbidden_header_name) | No |

## [Syntax](#syntax)

There are two possible directives for `X-Frame-Options`:

http
```
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN

```
### [Directives](#directives)

If you specify `DENY`, not only will the browser attempt to load the page in a frame fail when loaded from other sites, attempts to do so will fail when loaded from the same site. On the other hand, if you specify `SAMEORIGIN`, you can still use the page in a frame as long as the site including it in a frame is the same as the one serving the page.

[`DENY`](#deny)

The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so.

[`SAMEORIGIN`
Deprecated](#sameorigin)

The page can only be displayed if all ancestor frames are same origin to the page itself.

[`ALLOW-FROM origin`
Deprecated](#allow-from_origin)

This is an obsolete directive. Modern browsers that encounter response headers with this directive will ignore the header completely. The [`Content-Security-Policy`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) HTTP header has a [`frame-ancestors`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors) directive which you should use instead.

## [Examples](#examples)

**Warning:**
Setting `X-Frame-Options` inside the [`<meta>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta) element (e.g., `<meta http-equiv="X-Frame-Options" content="deny">`) has no effect. `X-Frame-Options` is only enforced via HTTP headers, as shown in the examples below.

### [Configuring Apache](#configuring_apache)

To configure Apache to send the `X-Frame-Options` header for all pages, add this to your site's configuration:

apacheconf
```
Header always set X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"

```

To configure Apache to set `X-Frame-Options` to `DENY`, add this to your site's configuration:

apacheconf
```
Header set X-Frame-Options "DENY"

```
### [Configuring Nginx](#configuring_nginx)

To configure Nginx to send the `X-Frame-Options` header, add this either to your http, server or location configuration:

nginx
```
add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN always;

```

You can set the `X-Frame-Options` header to `DENY` using:

nginx
```
add_header X-Frame-Options DENY always;

```
### [Configuring IIS](#configuring_iis)

To configure IIS to send the `X-Frame-Options` header, add this to your site's `Web.config` file:

xml
```
<system.webServer>
  â¦
  <httpProtocol>
    <customHeaders>
      <add name="X-Frame-Options" value="SAMEORIGIN" />
    </customHeaders>
  </httpProtocol>
  â¦
</system.webServer>

```

For more information, see the [Microsoft support article on setting this configuration using the IIS Manager](https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/office/mitigating-framesniffing-with-the-x-frame-options-header-1911411b-b51e-49fd-9441-e8301dcdcd79) user interface.

### [Configuring HAProxy](#configuring_haproxy)

To configure HAProxy to send the `X-Frame-Options` header, add this to your front-end, listen, or backend configuration:

```
rspadd X-Frame-Options:\ SAMEORIGIN

```

Alternatively, in newer versions:

```
http-response set-header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN

```
### [Configuring Express](#configuring_express)

To set `X-Frame-Options` to `SAMEORIGIN` using [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/) add the following to your server configuration:

js
```
const helmet = require("helmet");
const app = express();
app.use(
  helmet({
    xFrameOptions: { action: "sameorigin" },
  }),
);

```

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2056386#c0)  peyu    2022-02-21 06:38:20 UTC  ``` Login cockpit, create bond through cockpit, configure Bond's IPv4 and IPv6 to other types than the default types. The setting does not take effect and will return to "Automatic" mode immediately.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): RHVH: rhvh-4.5.0.2-0.20220216.0+1  subscription-manager-cockpit-1.28.25-1.el8.noarch cockpit-bridge-261-1.el8.x86_64 cockpit-system-261-1.el8.noarch cockpit-storaged-261-1.el8.noarch cockpit-ws-261-1.el8.x86_64 cockpit-261-1.el8.x86_64 cockpit-ovirt-dashboard-0.15.1-2.el8ev.noarch   How reproducible: 100%  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install redhat-virtualization-host-4.5.0-202202161646_8.6 2. Login cockpit via Firefox browser 3. Go to "Networking" -> "Interfaces" 4. Click "Add bond", input bond name, mode and other information 5. Configure the Bond's IPv4 and IPv6 with other types than the default "Automatic"types 6. Click the "Change the settings" button in the "Connection will be lost" dialog that pops up 7. Check Bond's IPv4 and IPv6 types   Actual results: 1. The setting does not take effect and will return to "Automatic" mode immediately.   Expected results: Configurations for Bond's IPv4 and IPv6 types should take effect   Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2056386#c1)  Martin Pitt    2022-02-22 08:29:33 UTC  ``` This sounds very similar to [bug 2056362](show_bug.cgi?id=2056362 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Changing NIC type rolls back the checkpoint"). But unlike that, I can actually reproduce it with a bond. (Marius: Just our bog standard `./vm-run -s cockpit.socket rhel-8-6` in bots)  I see that NM rolls back to the old connection, even though I clicked on "keep connection":    NetworkManager[884]: <info>  [1645518404.0318] checkpoint[0x55dbd109dc10]: rollback of /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/Checkpoint/11  Note that there is a lot of SELinux noise in the logs, due to [bug 2055199](show_bug.cgi?id=2055199 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - avc: denied { execute } for comm=\"nm-dispatcher\" name=\"04-iscsi\" on every boot"). But that's unrelated, `setenforce 0` does not change the behaviour.  Marius, can you please have a look?   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2056386#c2)  Marius Vollmer    2022-02-22 12:53:04 UTC  ``` (In reply to Martin Pitt from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=2056386#c1)) > I see that NM rolls back to the old connection, even though I clicked on > "keep connection": >  >   NetworkManager[884]: <info>  [1645518404.0318] checkpoint[0x55dbd109dc10]: > rollback of /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/Checkpoint/11  This is expected. The checkpoint is rolled back during the "Restoring connection" phase, and if you click "Keep connection" nothing more will be done.  Your changes have been undone and Cockpit is still connected to the server.  The checkpoint is always rolled back before we get the "Connection will be lost" dialog.  That dialog then gives you to choice to change settings anyway, without a checkpoint to protect you.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2056386#c3)  Marius Vollmer    2022-02-22 13:03:06 UTC  ``` > 7. Check Bond's IPv4 and IPv6 types  How did you check this exactly?  Cockpit itself is disconnected at this point and does no longer show correct information.  If you wait a bit, the network page will disappear completely and be replaced with a "Disconnected" screen.  (There is a "Reconnect" button but that wont work because there is no network connectivity any more.)  If I execute your steps, "nmcli con show bond0" on the machine itself shows the expected configuration.  > Expected results: > Configurations for Bond's IPv4 and IPv6 types should take effect   They do for me, but Cockpit does not always show them correctly because it has lost connection to the server at this point.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2056386#c4)  Marius Vollmer    2022-02-23 13:30:51 UTC  ``` Hmm, this is very likely also a instance of the bug fixed here: <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/17036>  In my comments above, I had assumed that the connection will indeed be lost for real and I had only tested those scenarios. But reading the description more closely, the disconnection is probably not expected and the wrong behavior of Cockpit can indeed be explained by <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/17036>.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2056386#c6)  Martin Pitt    2022-02-23 14:18:00 UTC  ``` Fix developed in <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/17036>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2056386#c7)  Martin Pitt    2022-02-23 14:18:38 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 2056362](show_bug.cgi?id=2056362 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Changing NIC type rolls back the checkpoint") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2056386#c9)  Martin Pitt    2022-02-24 08:56:22 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 2056446](show_bug.cgi?id=2056446 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - In cockpit, unable to down the network connection via NIC's ON/OFF button") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2056386#c10)  Martin Pitt    2022-02-25 09:42:14 UTC  ``` This fix is verified through gating test.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=2056386#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-05-10 15:18:39 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

## Embedding and Integrating Cockpit

[Embedding the Cockpit Interface](embedding.html#embedding-full)
[Integrating Cockpit Components into Web Applications](embedding.html#embedding-components)
[Deep Integration](embedding.html#embedding-deep)
[Pinging Cockpit](embedding.html#embedding-cors)

Cockpit can be embedded in other web applications either as a whole or specific
Cockpit components can be integrated. Due to frame security policy restrictions,
this only works if Cockpit and the web application have the *same origin*;
this is commonly achieved by running both from a common reverse proxy.

## Embedding the Cockpit Interface

Cockpit can be embedded into a larger web page as a frame. To embed
the entire Cockpit Window use the URI:
`https://server.example.com:9090/`

```

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Embedded Cockpit</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    This is Cockpit.
    <br/>
    <iframe width="800px" height="600px"
            src="https://server.example.com:9090/"/>
  </body>
</html>

```

## Integrating Cockpit Components into Web Applications

Instead of embedding the entirety of Cockpit, you can integrate specific components.
Only those components explicitly documented as API should be integrated. Other components
can and will change regularly.

The component will load from the server in question and a WebSocket connection
will be established with the server to relay the component's message stream.

Cockpit components are HTML files contained in
[packages](packages.html "Cockpit Packages"). These can be placed in an iframe or web browser
window. Each documented and stable component has a well-known URL and these are documented
in the [API reference](development.html "Part III. Developer Guide"). Each component URL begins with the string
`/cockpit/@localhost/` followed a package name, and then the component itself.

For example the
[terminal.html](api-terminal-html.html "terminal.html") in the
[system](api-system.html "API: system") package, has this URL:
`/cockpit/@localhost/system/terminal.html`

```

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Embedded Terminal</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    This is a terminal.
    <br/>
    <iframe width="800px" height="600px"
      src="https://server.example.com:9090/cockpit/@localhost/system/terminal.html"/>
  </body>
</html>

```

## Deep Integration

Most often [simple integration](embedding.html#embedding-components "Integrating Cockpit Components into Web Applications") will be used
to bring Cockpit components into web applications. However it is also possible to do deep
integration for embedders who wish to perform non-standard authentication with the server,
and relay the component's message stream to the server themselves.

### Warning

Deep integration capability is in heavy flux and is not yet documented.

## Pinging Cockpit

When embedding Cockpit or integrating Cockpit components, it may be necessary to check
whether Cockpit is available on a server before proceeding.

To do this perform a `/ping` request to Cockpit. This is a simple HTTP
GET request. It returns the following:

```

GET: https://server.example.com:9090/ping
200 OK: { "service": "cockpit" }

```

The `/ping` request allows
[Cross Origin Resource Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
headers and as such can be performed from Javascript code with any origin. The request can also be
made via plain HTTP without SSL. It is by design that no further information is present in the
response.

A complete example of using `/ping` is available in the Cockpit sources in the
`/examples/ping-server/` directory.

### @martinpitt **[martinpitt](/martinpitt)** commented [Sep 13, 2021](#issue-994680256) • edited by garrett Loading

Declare `X-Frame-Options: sameorigin` [1] so that cockpit frames can

only be embedded into pages coming from the same origin. This is similar

to setting CORP in commit [2b38b8d](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/commit/2b38b8de92f9aadb957b4c4251e6e49ef848e2f2) (which applies to `<script>`,

`<img>`, etc.).

The main use case for embedding is to run cockpit-ws behind a reverse

proxy, while also serving other pages. Cross-origin embedding is

discouraged these days to prevent "clickjacking".

Cross-origin embedding already did not work in practice, due to our

cookie restrictions: Frames would always just show the login page.

However, this looks confusing and is unclean. With X-Frame-Options, the

browser instead shows an explanatory error page.

Mention the same origin requirement in the embedding documentation.

## Webserver: Restrict frame embedding to same origin

Cockpit's web server now sets the [X-Frame-Options header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options) to explicitly disallow frame embedding within a different origin. Thanks to cookie policy restrictions, this was already prevented in most cases, as embedded frames would always show the login page. With this new option, the browser directly forbids cross-origin embedding and shows an explanatory error page instead. ([CVE-2021-3660](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5m9v-2hhc-h2wj "CVE-2021-3660"))

| Darn, when writing the `STATIC_HEADERS_CHUNKED` hack I already had a hunch that assuming glib hash ordering would backfire -- and [it did](https://logs.cockpit-project.org/logs/pull-16342-20210914-072625-784e2518-rhel-8-5/log.html).

`[common: Restrict frame embedding to same origin](/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/16342/commits/25a8a5c6e47268933b9b4433a9590ccfd9c04c83 "common: Restrict frame embedding to same origin

Declare `X-Frame-Options: sameorigin` [1] so that cockpit frames can
only be embedded into pages coming from the same origin. This is similar
to setting CORP in commit 2b38b8de92f9a (which applies to `<script>`,
`<img>`, etc.).

The main use case for embedding is to run cockpit-ws behind a reverse
proxy, while also serving other pages. Cross-origin embedding is
discouraged these days to prevent \"clickjacking\".

Cross-origin embedding already did not work in most cases: Frames would
always just show the login page.  However, this looks confusing and is
unclean. With X-Frame-Options, the browser instead shows an explanatory
error page.

Mention the same origin requirement in the embedding documentation.
