Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3710:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from Apport's incorrect handling of file paths during information gathering for crash reports. Specifically, when extracting the process ID (`Pid`) from the `ProcStatus` field of a crash report, the extracted value was directly appended to a file path without sufficient sanitization. This allowed for path traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization of the extracted process ID before using it in a file path. This allows an attacker to insert path traversal sequences like `../` into the `Pid` field, leading to access of files outside of the intended directory.
*   **Insecure File Attachment:** The `attach_file` and `attach_file_if_exists` functions in Apport were not adequately checking file paths, allowing them to attach files from arbitrary locations.
*   **Symlink Vulnerability:** The initial fix using `read_file()` only checked the basename for symlinks, but could still be exploited using symlinks in the path itself.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain read access to arbitrary files on the system. This could include sensitive files, such as `/etc/shadow`, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The ability to read arbitrary files allows the attacker to disclose sensitive information, such as user credentials, system configurations, and other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crash Report Manipulation:** An attacker crafts a malicious crash report file with a specially crafted `ProcStatus` field, which contains a `Pid` with path traversal sequences like `JRN/../../../etc/shadow`
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system to create and trigger the crash report.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system with the ability to create files in `/var/crash/`.
*   **Automatic Crash Reporting Enabled:** The system must have automatic crash reporting enabled for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was initially found in the `source_xorg.py` hook but was also present in other hooks such as openjdk and the main `ui.py` module of `apport`.
*   The fix involves changes in `apport/hookutils.py` to detect and prevent path traversal attacks and symlink abuse.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by checking that the resolved path does not contain symlinks or directory traversal sequences.
*   The fix was released in multiple Ubuntu versions as part of USN-5077-1 and USN-5077-2.
