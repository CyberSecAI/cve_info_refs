    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `xmlXIncludeDoProcess()` function within the `xinclude.c` file of the libxml2 library. This occurs when processing crafted XML files that contain XInclude elements.",
      "vulnerabilities": "Use-after-free.",
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause arbitrary code execution by enticing a user to process a specially crafted XML document using an application linked against libxml2. This can also lead to denial-of-service through application termination.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves processing a maliciously crafted XML file that contains XInclude elements.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious XML file to a user and entice the user (or an automated system) to process it using an application linked against a vulnerable libxml2 library. Remote exploitation is possible.",
        "other_details":"The vulnerability can occur when processing crafted files using the xmllint command with the --xinclude and --dropdtd options."
