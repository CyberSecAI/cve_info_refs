- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Binatone Hubble Cameras.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated remote code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker on the same network can gain unauthorized access to the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack, an attacker on the same network as the vulnerable device can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.
