Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `mobi_buffer_move` function within the `src/buffer.c` file of the `libmobi` library.
*   The original code had insufficient checks when moving the buffer's offset, specifically in the case where the target offset (`aoffset`) was less than the current buffer offset.
*   The bug is an out-of-bounds (OOB) write.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The vulnerability arises from a missing check that, when a negative offset is provided by `aoffset` it does not properly check for boundaries before writing to the buffer. The code will then write to memory outside of the intended buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Memory corruption:** An attacker can achieve memory corruption by moving the buffer's offset to a negative offset.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `mobi_buffer_move` function. By providing a crafted `offset` to this function, an attacker can trigger the out-of-bounds write.
*   Specifically, the code comment states "fix oob write bug inside libmobi".

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted `offset` value to the `mobi_buffer_move` function.
*   The attacker does not need to be local to the application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided code diff shows the fix, which adds a check `if ( (buf->offset < aoffset) || (buf->offset + len > buf->maxlen) )` to ensure the offset remains within the bounds of the buffer before moving it.
*   The commit message explicitly mentions "fix oob write bug inside libmobi".
*   The fix checks that target offset `aoffset` is not smaller than buffer's current offset before doing any operations.
