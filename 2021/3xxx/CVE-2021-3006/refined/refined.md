Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The core issue is the lack of access control on the `breed()` function within the `Farm` contract of the Seal Finance protocol. This function, intended to issue new Seal tokens as rewards, could be triggered by anyone, not just authorized users or the protocol itself.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Access Control:** The `breed()` function lacks any mechanism to restrict who can call it.
*   **Arbitrage Opportunity:** The `breed()` function's logic involves swapping newly minted Seal tokens for other tokens within the liquidity pool. This process, combined with the lack of access control, creates an arbitrage opportunity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Token Inflation:** Attackers can arbitrarily mint new SEAL tokens by repeatedly calling `breed()`
*   **Price Manipulation:** The swapping action of the `breed()` function can cause significant price fluctuations and imbalances within liquidity pools.
*   **Financial Loss:** Attackers can exploit these price changes to extract tokens from the pool for a profit. As a result, this leads to a loss for liquidity providers and the overall Seal Finance ecosystem.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Function Call:** The attacker directly calls the vulnerable `breed()` function within the `Farm` contract.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Basic Smart Contract Interaction Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to interact with Ethereum smart contracts.
*   **Access to Ethereum Network:** The attacker needs to be able to send transactions to the Ethereum network.
*   **No special privileges:** The attacker does not need any special permissions. They only need to make an on-chain transaction

**Summary of the Attack:**
The attacker exploited the missing access control on the `breed()` function to:
1.  Manipulate the Seal/SNX pair on Uniswap by swapping a small amount of Seal tokens for SNX, which significantly raises SNX's price.
2.  Call the vulnerable `breed()` function to mint new SEAL tokens and swap them to SNX at an artificially inflated price.
3.  Swap back the SNX to a larger amount of SEAL at the inflated price, profiting from the arbitrage.
This was done repeatedly across multiple pools and contracts.

**Additional Notes:**

* The attacker deployed multiple malicious contracts to execute these attacks.
* The vulnerability was actively being exploited as of the date of the blog post (Jan 3, 2021).
* A total of 4,247 Seal tokens were extracted initially, and the attacker continued exploiting this vulnerability after the initial report. By 2021/01/04, the attacker obtained 6,021 Seal tokens using 3 attacking contracts.
* The blog post also mentions that the root cause of the issue (lack of access control) resulted in substantial financial losses (estimated $58,467 USD initially) for the Seal Finance protocol.
