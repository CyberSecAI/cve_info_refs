Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-3294:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the "First Name" parameter of the CASAP Automated Enrollment System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the "First Name" field, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. This code is then stored in the database and executed whenever a user views the affected page (users.php).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Stealing:** An attacker can inject JavaScript to steal authenticated user's cookies.
*   **User Redirection:** The injected script can redirect users to a malicious website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack is performed through the web interface of the CASAP system via the `users.php` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid login credentials to access the user management interface within the CASAP application.
*   **Access to user management**: The attacker needs to have access to the user management section of the application where new user can be added.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter**: The attacker needs to know the `First Name` parameter is vulnerable.

**Additional Information:**

*   The Exploit-DB entry provides a detailed step-by-step guide on how to reproduce the vulnerability and demonstrates the impact by stealing a user's cookie.
*   The vulnerability is located in the CASAP Automated Enrollment System version 1.0, which is developed using PHP/MySQLi.
* The provided source code link to `sourcecodester.com` also confirms the application vulnerable is the same.
