## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 520 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2857016.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Description

Information disclosure in persistent watchers handling in Apache ZooKeeper due to missing ACL check. It allows an attacker to monitor child znodes by attaching a persistent watcher (addWatch command) to a parent which the attacker has already access to. ZooKeeper server doesn't do ACL check when the persistent watcher is triggered and as a consequence, the full path of znodes that a watch event gets triggered upon is exposed to the owner of the watcher. It's important to note that only the path is exposed by this vulnerability, not the data of znode, but since znode path can contain sensitive information like user name or login ID, this issue is potentially critical. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.2, 3.8.4 which fixes the issue.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 419 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2809080.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 38 new security patches for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  30 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html#FMW)

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security updates are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the Critical Patch Update October 2021 to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update October 2021 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2796575.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2796575.1).

### Description

There's a flaw in lz4. An attacker who submits a crafted file to an application linked with lz4 may be able to trigger an integer overflow, leading to calling of memmove() on a negative size argument, causing an out-of-bounds write and/or a crash. The greatest impact of this flaw is to availability, with some potential impact to confidentiality and integrity as well.

### Description

Internal webform for tracking the state of a release, requires input and sign off from:

* Eng
* Docs
* QE
* RCM

For every release, we must create an errata form to help coordinate with the other teams. For general product releases we create a Red Hat Enhancement Advisory(RHEA) errata form. For Common vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) releases we create a Red Hat Bug Advisory(RHEA) errata form. So examples are listed below.

### **Creating an Errata Advisory**

For creating a new errata advisory:

1. Click on the latest advisory type needed from the examples below.
2. On that page click "New Advisory"
3. Click "Manual Create"
4. Click "Clone an Advisory",entering advisory to be cloned. (eg. RHEA-2019:0627)
5. Click "Preview"
6. Click "Save Errata"

#### **Red Hat Bug Advisories (RHSA)**

**Help:** [\*https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1202471\*] \*\*

* 2.3.0 GA      <https://errata.devel.redhat.com/advisory/105561> (Jan 3, 2023)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1995259#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2021-08-18 17:10:50 UTC  ``` jsoup is a Java library for working with HTML. Those using jsoup versions prior to 1.14.2 to parse untrusted HTML or XML may be vulnerable to DOS attacks. If the parser is run on user supplied input, an attacker may supply content that causes the parser to get stuck (loop indefinitely until cancelled), to complete more slowly than usual, or to throw an unexpected exception. This effect may support a denial of service attack. The issue is patched in version 1.14.2. There are a few available workarounds. Users may rate limit input parsing, limit the size of inputs based on system resources, and/or implement thread watchdogs to cap and timeout parse runtimes.

### @jasperla **[jasperla](/jasperla)** commented [Feb 26, 2021](#issue-817420490)

I noticed a crash with `lz4jsoncat` when using this script to craft a payload:

```
   #!/usr/bin/env python3

    import sys

    def main():
        if len(sys.argv) != 3:
            print(f'[-] No filename or size given for payload')
            sys.exit(1)

        fname = sys.argv[1]
        size = sys.argv[2]

        # Handle arguments such as 0xffffffff if not provided as 4294967295

        else:

            sys.exit(1)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()
```

If the decompressed size is big enough, e.g. `0xff000000`-`0xffffffff` it will lead to a crash in liblz4:

```

```

The crash is due mishandling of the provided size of the decompressed contents in `LZ4_decompress_generic()`.

With a size set in the payload as `0xffffffff`, `dstSize` became `-1` and eventually gets passed to `memmove()`:

[lz4/lib/lz4.c](https://github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/909aae82604ad605bb60623731d825431cdf6b49/lib/lz4.c#L2038)

|  | memmove(op, ip, length); /\* supports overlapping memory regions; only matters for in-place decompression scenarios \*/ |

The original crash as observed from GDB:

```
    Stopped reason: SIGSEGV

```

When liblz4 is built with `-DLZ4_DEBUG=N` where N > 0, an assert is triggered instead:

[lz4/lib/lz4.c](https://github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/909aae82604ad605bb60623731d825431cdf6b49/lib/lz4.c#L2020)

[909aae8](/lz4/lz4/commit/909aae82604ad605bb60623731d825431cdf6b49)

|  | assert(op<=oend); |
| --- | --- |

and if the system allows for core dumps a file up to 4GB is generated which might lead to other problems.

The result is an abort of the application without making it to `memmove()`. The default configuration is with `LZ4_DEBUG` undefined (i.e. the assert is not hit).

The crasher was originally produced by AFL on Kali Linux and libz4+lz4jsoncat from git. This PR provides a simple check upfront to ensure no obviously invalid sizes are handled.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| [@jasperla](https://github.com/jasperla) this looks fine for me, but we'll have to wait for [@Cyan4973](https://github.com/Cyan4973) to approve, since I don't have push permissions.  It would be great to add a test case with the crafted input, that way we don't have to :)   * You could add a unit test of `LZ4_decompress_safe()` with a negative output size [here](https://github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/dev/tests/fuzzer.c#L555). * You could add the crafted input and test `LZ4F_decompress()` on it [here](https://github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/dev/tests/frametest.c#L352). |

| If the decompressed size is big enough, e.g. `0xff000000`-`0xffffffff` it will lead to a crash in liblz4:  Worth mentioning here, since this PR is referenced elsewhere :  These sizes are incompatible with the reference `lz4` implementation, which publishes a "maximum block size" as an absolute limit for a single block (of uncompressed data) : <https://github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/v1.9.4/lib/lz4.h#L211>  Consequently, the `lz4` library cannot be expected to decompress blocks larger than this limit. And incidentally, it's unable to generate such large blocks in the first place. Requesting it to do so nonetheless is simply a violation of its contract, and therefore is UB territory.  Obviously, in this case, the problem is aggravated because the size is converted into an `int` type without verifying if the casting into `int` is meaningful (aka original value is `<= INT_MAX`). It's worth underlining that this conversion is done on user side (aka, if I do understand this case properly, it's `lz4jsoncat`). After that point, it becomes an incorrect input parameter to the decompression function, which is a user-side bug.  How to behave in presence of such a user-side bug can be discussed, and in this PR, it's suggested to extend the interface contract of the decompression function, so that it returns an error code when it detects a negative size (i.e. it now has a defined behavior for this scenario). However, this won't help if the `outputSize` parameter is incorrect (oversized) but still positive. |

/\*\* Introduction
 LZ4 is lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed >500 MB/s per core, scalable with multi-cores CPU. It features an extremely fast decoder, with speed in multiple GB/s per core, typically reaching RAM speed limits on multi-core systems.
 The LZ4 compression library provides in-memory compression and decompression functions. It gives full buffer control to user. Compression can be done in: - a single step (described as Simple Functions) - a single step, reusing a context (described in Advanced Functions) - unbounded multiple steps (described as Streaming compression)
 lz4.h generates and decodes LZ4-compressed blocks (doc/lz4\_Block\_format.md). Decompressing such a compressed block requires additional metadata. Exact metadata depends on exact decompression function. For the typical case of LZ4\_decompress\_safe(), metadata includes block's compressed size, and maximum bound of decompressed size. Each application is free to encode and pass such metadata in whichever way it wants.
 lz4.h only handle blocks, it can not generate Frames.
 Blocks are different from Frames (doc/lz4\_Frame\_format.md). Frames bundle both blocks and metadata in a specified manner. Embedding metadata is required for compressed data to be self-contained and portable. Frame format is delivered through a companion API, declared in lz4frame.h. The `lz4` CLI can only manage frames.\*/

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1954559#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2021-04-28 11:36:37 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in lz4, where a potential memory corruption due to an integer overflow bug which caused one of the memmove arguments to become negative. Depending on how the library was compiled this will hit an assert() inside the library and dump core, leaving a 4GB core file, or it wil go into libc and crash inside the memmove() function.  Reference: <https://github.com/lz4/lz4/pull/972>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1954559#c1)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2021-04-28 11:38:13 UTC  ``` Created lz4 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1954560](show_bug.cgi?id=1954560 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2021-3520 lz4: memory corruption due to an integer overflow bug caused by memmove argument [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1954559#c2)  Todd Cullum    2021-05-04 21:42:39 UTC  ``` Upstream patch: <https://github.com/lz4/lz4/pull/972/commits/8301a21773ef61656225e264f4f06ae14462bca7>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1954559#c3)  Todd Cullum    2021-05-04 21:48:33 UTC  ``` The lz4 binary itself catches the problem when it parses the header, but it seems not all library consumers do and therefore LZ4_decompress_generic() was patched.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1954559#c5)  Todd Cullum    2021-05-04 22:06:09 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw is out of support scope for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. To learn more about Red Hat Enterprise Linux support life cycles, please see <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata> .   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1954559#c6)  Todd Cullum    2021-05-04 22:40:26 UTC  ``` Flaw summary:  In the LZ4_decompress_generic() routine, outputSize is retrieved from the lz4 file and is an integer. A code path allows outputSize to influence the value of `length` via `oend` in the call to memmove(op, ip, length). A crafted file can cause outputSize to be a negative value, and since length is interpreted by memmove() as a size_t, it can be an extremely large, out-of-bounds value. The upstream patch checks to ensure that outputSize is not less than 0 at the beginning of the routine.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1954559#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-06-29 16:30:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2021:2575 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:2575](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A2575)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1954559#c12)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-06-29 16:41:14 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

Probably the most incorrect statement is contained in this assertion :  "A crafted file can cause outputSize to be a negative value"  Absolutely not.  The #972 patch is completely unrelated to the payload ingested by the `LZ4_decompress*()` function, meaning there is no attack possible through a "crafted file" vector.  What <https://github.com/lz4/lz4/pull/972> covers is an _incorrect usage of the interface_ , by extending the contract of this interface.  The incorrect usage is providing an incorrect parameter as output buffer size, aka a wrong buffer size. Providing a wrong buffer size is considered UB territory, same class as providing a wrong pointer. That being said, in #972 the contract has been extended to detect and return a specific case when the size parameter is so completely wrong that it is negative. Note that this contract extension does not cover situations where the size is incorrect (too large) but still positive.  And neither should it try to. All interface contracts have limits, and providing obviously bogus parameters should not be classified as a CVE for the called function. It might be a CVE, but then for the _caller_ of the function.  It follows that any implementation that correctly invokes the LZ4 decoder interface was never at risk.  Other fixable statements seen in this thread :  - "a potential memory corruption due to an integer overflow" : it's not an integer overflow, it's a careless cast to `int` on the _user side_ of the code base (before invoking LZ4_decompress*() function) - "In the LZ4_decompress_generic() routine, outputSize is retrieved from the lz4 file" : LZ4_decompress*() never "retrieves" any size, it has no <stdio.h> dependency, it's unaware of the concept of file. What it does is receive an `outputSize` parameter. This parameter is controlled by the caller.  Not mentioned in the thread, but probably worth mentioning :  In the initial issue, the issuer illustrates the issue with this example : "If the decompressed size is big enough, e.g. 0xff000000-0xffffffff". The reference lz4 implementation publishes a _maximum block size_ as part of its interface, and is documented as not supporting single blocks larger than this maximum. This maximum size is set at 0x7E000000 (<https://github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/dev/lib/lz4.h#L212>). Hence, the examples are way out of range of the library contract.  PS : I'm not aware of, or don't know about, any process to "declassify" a CVE, so these comments are mostly provided for context.   ```   [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1954559#c19)  khalaniaspyn2    2022-11-25 07:01:44 UTC  Comment hidden (spam)  ``` This comment was flagged a spam, view the edit history to see the original text if required.   ```   [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1954559#c20)  sonnylee    2023-05-16 08:04:14 UTC  Comment hidden (spam)  ``` This comment was flagged a spam, view the edit history to see the original text if required.   ```   [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1954559#c21)  paulahong    2023-05-17 01:29:48 UTC  Comment hidden (spam)  ``` This comment was flagged a spam, view the edit history to see the original text if required.   ```   [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1954559#c22)  SaintOtis12    2023-06-27 06:35:27 UTC  Comment hidden (spam)  ``` This comment was flagged a spam, view the edit history to see the original text if required.   ```   [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1954559#c23)  larryellison    2023-08-07 07:01:04 UTC  Comment hidden (spam)  ``` I got it working fine based on [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:2575/](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A2575/) <https://geometrydashbloodbath.com>   ```   [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1954559#c24)  orlandoolivia106@gmail.com    2023-09-15 12:31:05 UTC  Comment hidden (spam)  ``` it pretty nice tbh !!<https://www.aairtickets.com/es/articulos/frontier-airlines-puerto-rico-telefono/>   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1954559#c26)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-05-30 20:24:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat AMQ Streams 2.7.0  Via RHSA-2024:3527 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3527](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3527)   ``` |  |

### Description

A flaw was found in SnappyInputStream in snappy-java, a data compression library in Java. This issue occurs when decompressing data with a too-large chunk size due to a missing upper bound check on chunk length. An unrecoverable fatal error can occur, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).

## Description

There's a flaw in lz4. An attacker who submits a crafted file to an application linked with lz4 may be able to trigger an integer overflow, leading to calling of memmove() on a negative size argument, causing an out-of-bounds write and/or a crash. The greatest impact of this flaw is to availability, with some potential impact to confidentiality and integrity as well.

# Geometry Dash Bloodbath

**Geometry Dash Bloodbath** is challenging any pro players in the world with a red theme. You need to control your geometry to return to the soul world safely.

## Join Geometry Dash Bloodbath race

In this game, you will get an opportunity to participate in an exciting adventure of the souls. A few years ago, the souls realized their powers were weakening. Therefore, they decided to come back to their soul world after having traversed the galaxy for a long time. They have had to search for space portals that take them to their hometown. At this time, the souls enter a space portal named Bloodbath. It is a dark path with numerous dangers such as spikes, monsters, and especially high walls which stop the souls from returning to their homes. Although they fail many times, they have never given up. They persist in overcoming all dangers despite the obstruction of the Death God. They know that persistence is the only key to success.

## Geometry Dash

Actually, this game is a 1.9/2.0/2.1 Extreme Demon of Geometry Dash. So, what is Geometry Dash? Why does it attract millions of players from all over the world?

Geometry Dash is a series of five platforming video games created by a Swedish developer named Robert Topala. It was published by RobTop Games on 13 August 2013. The Steam version was released on 22 December 2014. In this game, you are expected to complete 21 levels with varying degrees of difficulty. Each level has a distinct map and names such as Stereo Madness, Back On Track, Polargeist, Dry Out, Can't Let Go, Jumper, Time Machine, and so on. Their degrees of difficulty is Easy, Normal, Hard, Harder, Insane, and Demon. You need to complete the levels in the game to earn these achievements and claim new characters and colors. In addition, the theme on all levels is designed beautifully and the songs are produced by artists such as ForeverBound, DJVI, DJ-Nate, Waterflame, F-777, MDK, and Topala. Therefore, the music in the game is catchy.

### Hardest Geometry Dash level

Based on the original version of Geometry Dash, many Geometry Dash Scratch levels are created and attract a huge number of players. The players comment that some levels are easy and some are very difficult. According to me, the hardest Geometry Dash level is Geometry Dash Bloodbath. Moreover, this adventure game is placed in first place on the Geometry Dash Demonlist. I even can reach the first portal although it is near my geometry. I highly recommend this hard game to skillful players.

### Geometry Dash unblocked

Children and adults can enjoy Geometry Dash unblocked versions with different devices at school or work. Specifically, Geometry Dash Bloodbath is one of the unblocked versions in this series. Moreover, with light graphics, weak devices also can access this hard game. Enjoy this game even if you are walking outside or staying at home.

## How to play the Geometry Dash Bloodbath game

This game is played by jumping or flying up to dodge all obstacles such as spikes, high walls, monsters, and so on. They appear densely on the path. Remember that you will return to the starting point if you unexpectedly collide with them. Therefore, you must stay in high concentration, react quickly, and tap the screen in time to avoid all obstacles perfectly. You can utilize colorful jump pads and orbs on the road to make double jumps. In addition, you will pass various portals along the way. These portals will change your appearance. You can transform into a ship, a cube, a UFO, a ball, or a wave. No matter who you are, your ultimate target is safely reaching your destination. Look at the progress bar at the top of the screen to know how far you have gone.

One new thing in Geometry Dash Bloodbath is the time scale at the top left of the screen. It allows you to adjust the speed of the character. If you just start playing this game, you had better lower the speed of the character to practice first. When you master all skills, challenge yourself with the fastest speed. Let's see how long you can get to the destination.

**How to control:** Click the left mouse button or press the spacebar to jump or fly up.

### Two game modes

Geometry Dash Bloodbath offers two game modes: Normal Mode and Practice Mode. In the Practice mode, you are allowed to use a green gem to set checkpoints. It means that you can revive at the checkpoints along the way instead of at the beginning of the level after you hit the obstacles. Therefore, this mode is suitable for newbies who are just starting to discover the game.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2031958#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-12-13 19:17:52 UTC  ``` Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. Netty prior to version 4.1.7.1.Final skips control chars when they are present at the beginning / end of the header name. It should instead fail fast as these are not allowed by the spec and could lead to HTTP request smuggling. Failing to do the validation might cause netty to "sanitize" header names before it forward these to another remote system when used as proxy. This remote system can't see the invalid usage anymore, and therefore does not do the validation itself. Users should upgrade to version 4.1.7.1.Final to receive a patch.  Reference: <https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-wx5j-54mm-rqqq>  Upstream patch: <https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/07aa6b5938a8b6ed7a6586e066400e2643897323>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2031958#c1)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-12-13 19:18:21 UTC  ``` Created netty tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2031959](show_bug.cgi?id=2031959 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2021-43797 netty: control chars in header names may lead to HTTP request smuggling [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2031958#c6)  Jonathan Christison    2021-12-17 16:04:09 UTC  ``` Marking the Red Hat AMQ Broker as having a low impact, although a vulnerable version of netty is distributed its use of netty is not as a proxy to any other http servers which is a prerequisite of the flaw.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=2031958#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-02-14 13:08:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Data Grid 8.3.0  Via RHSA-2022:0520 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:0520](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A0520)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=2031958#c18)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-02-14 13:47:38 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2135435#c0)  Chess Hazlett    2022-10-17 16:23:22 UTC  ``` Apache Commons Text performs variable interpolation, allowing properties to be dynamically evaluated and expanded. The standard format for interpolation is "${prefix:name}", where "prefix" is used to locate an instance of org.apache.commons.text.lookup.StringLookup that performs the interpolation. Starting with version 1.5 and continuing through 1.9, the set of default Lookup instances included interpolators that could result in arbitrary code execution or contact with remote servers. These lookups are: - "script" - execute expressions using the JVM script execution engine (javax.script) - "dns" - resolve dns records - "url" - load values from urls, including from remote servers Applications using the interpolation defaults in the affected versions may be vulnerable to remote code execution or unintentional contact with remote servers if untrusted configuration values are used. Users are recommended to upgrade to Apache Commons Text 1.10.0, which disables the problematic interpolators by default.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2135435#c11)  Rodrigo A B Freire    2022-10-18 10:46:47 UTC  ``` Statement:   eap-7, eapxp-4, camel-k, camel-q have maven references to the affected package but does not ship it nor use the code   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=2135435#c13)  Rodrigo A B Freire    2022-10-18 11:17:49 UTC  ``` After further evaluation, we found that EAP has apache-commons-text dependency explicitly declared under exclusions :  <https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-eap7/blob/EAP_7.4.7.CR3-dev/pom.xml>  Hence marking EAP as not affected and closing the EAP tracker.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=2135435#c18)  Chess Hazlett    2022-10-18 19:30:48 UTC  ``` adding openshift-4 and satellite-6 affected/fix   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=2135435#c25)  ir.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 342 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2788740.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3899.pdf) - The NVE Datasheet
provides a holistic overview of the NVE solution and use cases. If you have
ever wondered what NVE is, or what encryption algorithm it uses, this is the
resource for you!

[ONTAP 9.x STIG](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/?_dl_facet_stigs=network-other)

* Ver 1, Rel 1 of the NetApp ONTAP DSC 9.x STIG has been posted to the Security
  Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) Document Library.

#### Threats

Threat resources consist of guidance to address known threats through a
combination of prevention, mitigation, and remediation.

##### Ransomware

[The NetApp Solution for
Ransomware](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4572.pdf) - Ransomware wages war
on every environment. Being the custodians of one of the worldâs most valuable
resources (data/information), itâs imperative that we protect it. When it comes
to ransomware, this is your guide to addressing and remediating the threat.

[NetApp and Varonis ransomware white
paper](https://info.varonis.com/hubfs/docs/whitepapers/en/Varonis-Ransomware-Whitepaper-Netapp.pdf) -
As a companion to the NetApp Solution for Ransomware, we have partnered with
Varonis in addressing the advanced techniques around this threat. We have
discussed and captured the solution in this joint white paper.

#### Integration and Solutions Guides

As we continue to tout the key elements of security including key management,
we understand the challenges and value of timeliness as it applies to adoption
and deployment. Due to such challenges we provide integration guides where we
walk through the configuration/provisioning of âkeyâ elements such as key
managers, FPolicy, and other security laden integration solutions.

##### Key Management

[NetApp ONTAP 9 External Key Management: Vormetric Key Management Integration
Guide](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4618.pdf) - The Vormetric integration
guide for ONTAP 9 depicts how to provision the Vormetric (Thales) key manager
for use with ONTAP 9.

##### FPolicy

[Cloud Insights with Cloud Secure](https://cloud.netapp.com/ci-sde-plp-cloud-secure-info-trial?hsCtaTracking=fefadff4-c195-4b6a-95e3-265d8ce7c0cd%7Cb696fdde-c026-4007-a39e-5e986c4d27c6)

[FPolicy Solution Guide for Clustered Data ONTAP: Varonis DatAdvantage](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4429.pdf)

[FPolicy Solution Guide for Clustered Data ONTAP: Veritas Data Insight](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4473.pdf)

##### Anti-Virus

[Antivirus Solution Guide for McAfee](https://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4286.pdf)

[Antivirus Solution Guide for Symantec](https://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4304.pdf)

[Antivirus Solution Guide for Trend Micro](https://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4312.pdf)

#### Compliance

Compliance continues to evolve and shape the manner in which we address the
organizationâs of today and more importantly how we address securing the data.
Remember Security does not equal Compliance, but security does in fact aid in
addressing the challenge.

##### PCI DSS

## Overview

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 8 and 9

Red Hat understands the importance of life cycle planning for our customers, partners, ISVs, and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux ecosystem. With the introduction of Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 8, Red Hat simplified the RHEL product phases from four to three: Full Support, Maintenance Support, and Extended Life Phase. We are also providing information on anticipated release dates and minor releases that will offer extended support.

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 8 and 9 delivers a ten year life cycle in Full Support and Maintenance Support Phases followed by an Extended Life Phase. In addition, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 customers may purchase annual Add-on subscriptions called Extended Life-cycle Support (ELS) to extend limited subscription services beyond the Maintenance Support Phase.

#### Life Cycle[viii](#viii):

![](/sites/default/files/images/355_rhel_life_cycle_updates_0723_2.png)

The Red Hat Enterprise Linux life cycle phases are designed to reduce the level of change within each major release[i](#i) over time and make release availability and content more predictable.[ii](#ii)

## Details

During the life cycle for each major version, software changes to Red Hat Enterprise Linux are delivered via individual updates known as *errata advisories* through the [Red Hat Customer Portal](/home)[iii](#iii) or other authorized Red Hat portals. Errata advisories may be released individually on an as-needed basis or aggregated as a minor release. Errata advisories will contain security fixes (Red Hat Security Advisories or RHSAs), bug fixes (Red Hat Bug Fix Advisories or RHBAs), or feature enhancements (Red Hat Enhancement Advisories or RHEAs). Errata advisories are tested and qualified against the active Red Hat Enterprise Linux major release. (For example, a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 RHSA will be applied cumulatively to the latest Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 version and patch set.) Released errata advisories remain accessible to active subscribers for the entire Red Hat Enterprise Linux life cycle. Within each major release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, any errata advisory (including one released as part of a minor release) will be applied cumulatively to the latest release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, including any patch sets.

During the life cycle of a major Red Hat Enterprise Linux release, Red Hat makes commercially reasonable efforts to maintain binary compatibility for the core runtime environment across all minor releases and errata advisories. If necessary, Red Hat may make exceptions to this compatibility goal for Critical impact security or other significant issues. Furthermore, major releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux contain a limited set of backward-compatible libraries included in previous major releases to allow for the easy migration of applications. Typically, Red Hat applies changes in such a way as to minimize the amount of change and to maintain binary compatibility. Exceptions may apply for controlled package re-bases under certain circumstances. The binary compatibility goal is extended to Red Hat Enterprise Linux for use in an application container. Additional details can be found in the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8: Application Compatibility Guide](/articles/rhel8-abi-compatibility), or the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9: Application Compatibility Guide](/articles/rhel9-abi-compatibility).

The following table details the subscription services, including support and software maintenance, performed during each phase of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux life cycle:

1. Technical Support access depends on the Service Level included in your Red Hat Enterprise Linux Subscription.
2. Red Hat may choose, as a temporary measure, to address those catastrophic issues with a significant customer business impact with a Hotfix while the Bug Fix errata advisory (RHBA) is being created.
3. Native hardware enablement is provided by backporting hardware drivers, etc., to the relevant version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Hardware enablement using virtualization is achieved by running an earlier version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a virtual guest on a newer version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. See the [Virtualization](#Virtualization) description below for details. NOTE: Hardware certification (including the associated hardware limits) applies to the version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux that is being used as the host.
4. Intentionally left blank.
5. Software enhancements are additions of new functionality beyond correcting defects or enabling previously existing functionality on a new hardware generation.
6. Major releases are the primary vehicle for significant software enhancements, although low-impact software enhancement may also be delivered in minor releases.
7. See the [Extended Life Phase](#Extended_Life_Cycle_Phase) description below.
8. Extended Update Support (EUS), Enhanced Extended Update Support (Enhanced EUS), and Extended Life-cycle Support (ELS) are available as optional add-ons. See the [EUS](#Extended_Update_Support), [Enhanced EUS,](#Enhanced_Extended_Update_Support) and [ELS](#Extended_Life_Cycle_Support) descriptions below.
9. For existing installations only. See details [below](#Extended_Life_Cycle_Phase) for other limitations.
10. See the [Issue Severity Classification](/site/security/updates/classification/) page for security severity classifications.
11. All errata provided at Red Hat's discretion.
12. Intentionally left blank.
13. Intentionally left blank.
14. Updated installation image provided at first minor release GA date.

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux Production Phases

### Full Support Phase[iv](#iv):

During the Full Support Phase, [Red Hat defined](/security/updates/classification/) Critical and Important Security errata advisories (RHSAs) and Urgent and Selected (at Red Hat discretion) High Priority Bug Fix errata advisories (RHBAs) will be released as they become available. Other errata advisories may be delivered as appropriate.

If available, new or improved hardware enablement and select enhanced software functionality may be provided at the discretion of Red Hat, generally in minor releases. Hardware enablement that does not require substantial software changes may be provided independent from minor releases at Red Hat's discretion.

Minor releases will also include available and qualified errata advisories (RHSAs, RHBAs, and RHEAs). Minor releases are cumulative and include the contents of previously released updates. The focus for minor releases during this phase lies on resolving defects of medium or higher priority.

Updated installation images will be provided for minor releases during the Full Support Phase.

### Maintenance Support Phase :

During the Maintenance Support Phase for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 8 & 9 [Red Hat defined](/security/updates/classification/) Critical and Important[ix](#ix) impact Security Advisories (RHSAs) and selected (at Red Hat discretion) Urgent Priority Bug Fix Advisories (RHBAs) will be released as they become available. Other errata advisories may be delivered as appropriate.

New functionality and new hardware enablement are not planned for availability in the Maintenance Support Phase.

### Extended Life Phase:

During the Extended Life Phase, a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription provides continued access to previously released content on the [Red Hat Customer Portal](/home), as well as other content such as documentation and the Red Hat Knowledgebase. Advice for migrating to currently supported Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions may also be provided.

For versions of products in the Extended Life Phase, Red Hat will provide limited ongoing technical support. No bug fixes, security fixes, hardware enablement or root-cause analysis will be available during this phase, and support will be provided on existing installations only.

Red Hat reserves the right to terminate the ongoing support in the Extended Life Phase for a particular version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux at any time.

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 Life Cycle Red Hat is providing further predictability for Red Hat Enterprise Linux customers, partners, and ISVs. The below map provides details on when minor releases are planned, and which minor releases will include Extended Update Support and Update Services for SAP Solutions. Minor releases are planned for release every six months through the Full Support phase. RHEL 8 Planning Guide[viii](#viii) RHEL 9 Planning Guide[viii](#viii)

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux Application Streams Life Cycle

The vast majority of packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 8 & 9, including most Application Streams, will be maintained for the full 10 year Red Hat Enterprise Linux life cycle. Specified life cycle components, however, will be maintained for less than 10 years, with a specified life cycle often matching the upstream life of the component.

Application Streams will adhere to the errata criteria for the Production Phase of the major release. For example, errata released for an Application Stream for RHEL 8 or 9 during the Maintenance Support Phase will be confined to [Red Hat defined](/security/updates/classification/) Critical and Important[ix](#ix) impact Security Advisories (RHSAs) and selected (at Red Hat discretion) Urgent Priority Bug Fix Advisories (RHBAs). Similarly, no new Application Streams will be released during the Maintenance Support Phase and Extended Life Phase since Software Enhancements are not permitted during these phases. However, to achieve the 10 years support criteria for RHEL, one version of each Application Stream will be identified at the start of the Maintenance Support Phase and that version will receive maintenance as described by the support phases.

For example, most databases are supported upstream for 5 years and maintenance of their Application Stream in RHEL 8 or 9 will align with their upstream support. There will be overlapping PostgreSQL Application Streams in RHEL 8, with each stream maintained for 5 years. Customers may select the Application Stream version that best meets their needs. They can install an older version, install a newer version and stay on it for the full 5 years, or update to the latest stream with each release, whatever best fits their use case. Customers never have to update, they can update at their own convenience. If a customer asks for support beyond the specified life of an Application Stream, they may be asked to move to a newer Application Stream to take advantage of bug fixes and CVE advisories.

Please see the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux Application Streams Life Cycle](/support/policy/updates/rhel-app-streams-life-cycle) page for more information.

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux Extended Maintenance

### Extended Update Support Add-on[vii](#vii)

Red Hat offers the Extended Update Support (EUS) Add-On to a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription for those customers who wish to standardize on a specific minor release for an extended period of time. The EUS Add-On allows customers the flexibility to decide when to take advantage of new Red Hat Enterprise Linux features, including new hardware enablement.

Under a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription, all available RHSAs and RHBAs are provided for the current active minor release until the availability of the next minor release.

* [**RHEL 6 ELS Inclusion List**](/articles/4997301).

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, the ELS Add-On covers the IBM z Systems and the x86 architecture, both 32-bit and 64-bit variants. Add-Ons are not covered by ELS.

For guidance on how to best modernize your Red Hat infrastructure with a solution that meets your business needs, contact Red Hat Consulting.

**Note:** Only Standard or Premium subscriptions to RHEL Server are eligible for ELS Support. RHEL Desktop or RHEL Workstation subscriptions are not eligible for ELS.

### RHEL 7 Extended Life-cycle Support Add-On:

Extended Life-cycle Support (ELS) is an optional Add-On subscription for certain Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscriptions. The ELS Add-on is available during the Extended Life Phase for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 ELS delivers certain Red Hat defined Critical and Important security fixes and selected (at Red Hat discretion) urgent priority bug fixes and troubleshooting for the [last minor release](#Life_Cycle_Dates).

## Virtualization

Virtualization provides hardware abstraction for guest operating systems. Abstraction allows a guest that is running an older version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux that does not support the latest server hardware to be easily deployed on a virtualization host that does. In this way, a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 guest can be hosted by Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 on a latest-generation processor.

Red Hat intends to support those versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux that are still within the Production or Extended Life Phase when run as virtualized guests on later versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

The [Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtualization support matrix](http://www.redhat.com/resourcelibrary/articles/enterprise-linux-virtualization-support) provides details on the supported combinations of operating systems, versions, and hardware architectures.

## Life-cycle Dates

All future dates mentioned for "End of Full Support" and "End of Maintenance Support 1" are close approximations, non definitive, and subject to change.
