      "details": "Root cause of vulnerability:\nThe root cause is an integer overflow bug in the lz4 compression library's `LZ4_decompress_generic()` function that occurs when decompressing a crafted payload.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\nThe vulnerability lies in the mishandling of the decompressed size. When the size is too large, it leads to a negative size argument being passed to memmove(), resulting in an out-of-bounds write.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\nSuccessful exploitation can lead to memory corruption, an out-of-bounds write, or a crash, causing a denial of service. It may potentially also expose confidential and integrity issues.\n\nAttack vectors:\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted compressed file that triggers the integer overflow during decompression.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\nThe attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted input to a system utilizing the vulnerable lz4 library to trigger the decompression. No authentication or special privileges are required, it is remotely exploitable."
