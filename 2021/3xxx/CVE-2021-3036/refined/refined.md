- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the improper handling of PAN-OS XML API requests that include duplicate API parameters. When such requests are made, the system logs sensitive information in cleartext to the web server logs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Exposure Through Log Files (CWE-532). Specifically, administrator secrets (username, password, and API key) are logged in cleartext.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who gains access to the web server logs can retrieve the cleartext administrator credentials (username, password, and API key), potentially leading to unauthorized access and control of the PAN-OS system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the web server logs. The vulnerability is triggered by sending a PAN-OS XML API request with duplicate parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have local access to the system where the web server logs are stored. Additionally, the attacker needs to have knowledge of the PAN-OS XML API and how to construct API requests with duplicate parameters. Privileges required to access the web server logs are high.
