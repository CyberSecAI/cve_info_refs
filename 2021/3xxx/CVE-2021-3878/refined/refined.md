  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references within the `DomReader.java` and `Ssurgeon.java` files. These files use `DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance()` which is vulnerable to XXE attacks if not properly configured.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (XXE)"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the server, cause a denial of service, or potentially achieve remote code execution by including malicious XML entities.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network-based attacks.  An attacker could send crafted XML data to a server using the vulnerable code. This may be possible if a user-supplied XML file is parsed by the application."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send XML data to the application.  This could be achieved through a file upload, an API endpoint that consumes XML or other means."
