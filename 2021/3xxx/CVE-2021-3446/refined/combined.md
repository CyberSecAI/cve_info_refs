tpm2: CryptSym: fix AES output IV

```
The TPM is supposed to provide the output IV in the ivInOut parameter in
CryptSymmetricEncrypt. In the case of using the openssl routines, the
output IV is missed, and the resulting output from the TPM is in the
input IV.

OpenSSL unfortunately does not export EVP_CIPHER_CTX_iv() until
tags/OpenSSL_1_1_0, so we have to fall back to the reference code for
previous OpenSSL versions.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1939664#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-03-16 19:05:58 UTC  ``` The commonly used integration of libtpms with OpenSSL contained a vulnerability related to the returned IV (initialization vector) when certain symmetric ciphers were used. Instead of returning the last IV it returned the initial IV to the caller. The fix for this required the copying of the last-used IV from OpenSSL so it can be return back to the caller and used in subsequent encryption and decryption steps. The side-effect of the fix is that previously chain-encrypted data will not be decryptable anymore with the TPM 2.  Reference and upstream patch: <https://github.com/stefanberger/libtpms/commit/32c159ab53db703749a8f90430cdc7b20b00975e>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1939664#c1)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-03-16 19:06:23 UTC  ``` Created libtpms tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1939665](show_bug.cgi?id=1939665 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2021-3446 libtpms: return of wrong initialization vector when certain symmetric ciphers are used [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1939664#c3)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-03-25 10:42:19 UTC  ``` Statement:  The versions of `libtpms` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Advanced Virtualization are affected by this issue.

tpm2: CryptSym: fix AES output IV

```
The TPM is supposed to provide the output IV in the ivInOut parameter in
CryptSymmetricEncrypt. In the case of using the openssl routines, the
output IV is missed, and the resulting output from the TPM is in the
input IV.

OpenSSL unfortunately does not export EVP_CIPHER_CTX_iv() until
tags/OpenSSL_1_1_0, so we have to fall back to the reference code for
previous OpenSSL versions.

tpm2: CryptSym: fix AES output IV

```
The TPM is supposed to provide the output IV in the ivInOut parameter in
CryptSymmetricEncrypt. In the case of using the openssl routines, the
output IV is missed, and the resulting output from the TPM is in the
input IV.

OpenSSL unfortunately does not export EVP_CIPHER_CTX_iv() until
tags/OpenSSL_1_1_0, so we have to fall back to the reference code for
previous OpenSSL versions.
