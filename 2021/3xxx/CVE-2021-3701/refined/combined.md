| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1977959#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2021-06-30 19:40:08 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in ansible-runner. The default temporary files configuration in ansible-2.0.0 is written to world rw location. An attacker can pre-create that directory, which may allow them to either read potentially private information or force ansible-runner to write files as the legitimate user in a place they did not expect.  Upstream issue:  <https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner/issues/738>  Upstream patch:  <https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner/pull/742/commits/60b059f00409224acae1e417153a241c8591ad89>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1977959#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2021-06-30 19:40:56 UTC  ``` Created python-ansible-runner tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1977962](show_bug.cgi?id=1977962 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2021-3701 python-ansible-runner: ansible-runner: Artifacts are written to world rw location by default [epel-7]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1977961](show_bug.cgi?id=1977961 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2021-3701 python-ansible-runner: ansible-runner: Artifacts are written to world rw location by default [fedora-all]")] Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1977960](show_bug.cgi?id=1977960 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2021-3701 python-ansible-runner: ansible-runner: Artifacts are written to world rw location by default [openstack-rdo]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1977959#c4)  Sage McTaggart    2021-07-02 20:49:33 UTC  ``` Red Hat Ceph Storage 4 ships an older version of ansible-runner which does not include the affected code, however, it does use a hardcoded path to the private data, with shipping a vulnerable os.path.join functionality, which could result in an attacker pre-creating the directory for the private data with world rw permissions as in this flaw. As a result, a low priority tracker has been filed.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1977959#c7)  Tapas Jena    2021-08-11 17:29:29 UTC  ``` Analysis is complete for all the concerned Ansible components and it was found that AAP 1.2 and Ansible Tower are affected by this vulnerability. However, AAP 2.0 is "Not Affected" by this vulnerability as it ships ansible-runner 2.0.1 which already contains the fix for this issue.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1977959#c10)  Tapas Jena    2021-11-12 17:09:19 UTC  ``` This vulnerability was part of ansible_runner_2.0 but was fixed before it got published it.  It was fixed by this PR <https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner/pull/742> (the commits in that PR got back-port to release_2.0 before we went GA) This code wasn't part of 1.4 - so no released version of runner is actually impacted by this.  Finally, no any shipped ansible runner version from Red Hat has been facing the issue. Hence, though this was marked as "affected" initially, marking it back to "not affected" . However, since this is a valid vulnerability, the CVE will remain valid as well.   ``` |  |

### @abadger **[abadger](/abadger)** commented [Jun 28, 2021](#issue-931956348)

Looking through the code, I found two separate race conditions with tempfile handling which can be exploited. One of those is mentioned in [#738](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner/issues/738). The other one happens because we create a tempdir and then delete it, then later reuse its name. An attacker can pre-create the tempdir in between the deletion and the second creation with the reused name. This PR attempts to fix both.

Fixes [#738](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner/issues/738)

Sorry, something went wrong.

* #### [When creating a private\_data\_dir in a world writable location, use mkdtemp()](/ansible/ansible-runner/pull/742/commits/60b059f00409224acae1e417153a241c8591ad89 "When creating a private_data_dir in a world writable location, use mkdtemp() The previous code allowed for an easily exploitable race where the attacker could pre-create a known directory name to gain access to private files created by ansible-runner. Using mkdtemp() closes that hole because mkdtemp() ensures that the directory name returned has been allocated with restrictive permissions by mkdtemp itself so the attacker has no opportunity to inject their own directory. Fixes #738")

* #### [Close a race condition with temporary files](/ansible/ansible-runner/pull/742/commits/0e9aa8a97e7832ef9a1553ef2908632a32d2b8c4 "Close a race condition with temporary files The previous code allowed a race where an attacker could watch for creation of a rapid creation and deletion of a temporary directory, substitute their own directory at that name, and then have access to ansible-runner's private_data_dir the next time ansible-runner made ues of the private_data_dir. This code fixes the issue by creating the directory securely using mkdtemp() and not deleting it afterwards.")

* #### [Fix unittests for new private\_data\_dir handling](/ansible/ansible-runner/pull/742/commits/f1a4f789bd17f4e1adebaaa0f8eb99d58c0182bf "Fix unittests for new private_data_dir handling * Most tests just need to be changed to account for a default private_data_dir which doesn't have a predictable name. * test_container_volmount_generation has several tests where mocking of os.path.exists for the _update_volume_mount_paths() function which was being tested interfered with proprer creation of a BaseConfig() object. Moved the mocking to occur after the BaseConfig() instantiation to make those work.")
