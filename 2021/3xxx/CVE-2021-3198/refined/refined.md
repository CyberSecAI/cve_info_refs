The provided content relates to CVE-2021-3198.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of input provided to the `install rpm url` command within the `clish` restricted shell. Specifically, the `URL.Source` type, which is intended to validate the URL, does not prevent command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- OS Command Injection (CWE-78): The `install rpm url` command directly passes the unsanitized URL input to the `wget` command, allowing for the injection of arbitrary shell commands.
- Insufficient Input Sanitization: The `URL.Source` type's regex pattern fails to properly sanitize the input, enabling attackers to inject malicious commands into the URL field.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands with root privileges, leading to complete control of the affected device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based: The attacker uses the `install rpm url` command with a malicious URL that includes shell commands.
- The attacker must have access to the restricted shell and the password required to enable privileged commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have administrative access to the MobileIron Core's restricted shell (clish).
- The attacker needs the password to enable privileged commands in the shell.
