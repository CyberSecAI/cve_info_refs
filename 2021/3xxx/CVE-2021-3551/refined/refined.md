The deployment tool has been modified to use this option when creating the admin user to avoid the password from getting logged in the debug mode.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* pki-server: Dogtag installer \"pkispawn\" logs admin credentials into a world-readable log file (CVE-2021-3551)\n\nThe PKI installer \"pkispawn\" logs admin credentials into a world-readable log file. It also looks like the installer is passing the password as an insecure command line argument. The credentials are the 389-DS LDAP server's Directory Manager credentials. The Directory Manager is 389-DS' equivalent of unrestricted root account. The user bypasses permission checks and grants full access to data. In an IdM / FreeIPA installation the DM user is able to read and manipulate Kerberos KDC master password, Kerberos keytabs, hashed user passwords, and more. Any and all IdM and FreeIPA installations with PKI 10.10 should be considered compromised.",
