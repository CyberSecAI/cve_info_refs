Thanks I have a few small things inline, but this looks good and works well overall (I have yet to try the counterpart though).

A couple points that I think are worth signaling:

* If primary is launched with mounts disabled, it doesn't get the Home mount, even if the setting is later enabled. I suppose this is as expected, and kind of consistent with what happens when changing the name of the primary instance to an instance that already existed (it keeps its mounts, or absence thereof).
* The security of this approach relies on the daemon settings not being writable (just deletable on Linux/Mac). If someone was able to edit `DAEMON_CONFIG_HOME` on Linux, change the permissions of certain Windows folders, or even change the name of the multipass daemon, they could have a chance at changing the setting. All of those should again require elevated privileges, but something we need to bear in mind in future changes.

Sorry, something went wrong.

> * If primary is launched with mounts disabled, it doesn't get the Home mount, even if the setting is later enabled. I suppose this is as expected, and kind of consistent with what happens when changing the name of the primary instance to an instance that already existed (it keeps its mounts, or absence thereof).

Yeah, that's by design.

> * The security of this approach relies on the daemon settings not being writable (just deletable on Linux/Mac). If someone was able to edit `DAEMON_CONFIG_HOME` on Linux, change the permissions of certain Windows folders, or even change the name of the multipass daemon, they could have a chance at changing the setting. All of those should again require elevated privileges, but something we need to bear in mind in future changes.

Yup, this relies on `multipass set local.*` requiring privileged operation. But it's not special in that we don't want *any* `local.*` settings being modifiable without privileges.

Sorry, something went wrong.
