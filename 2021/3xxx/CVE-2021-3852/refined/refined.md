Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control when updating and removing comments within the GROWI application. Specifically, the code lacked proper checks to ensure that only the author of a comment could modify or delete it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Authorization:** The initial implementation allowed any authenticated user to potentially modify or delete comments, regardless of authorship. The code used to check if a user was an admin, or just used a function that checks if the user is the author of the comment.
*   **Missing Author Check:** In the original implementation the server route logic did not verify if the user making the request to update or delete a comment was actually the comment's creator. The client side code was checking, but the server was not.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Tampering:** An attacker could modify comments made by other users, potentially changing the meaning or intent of discussions.
*   **Data Deletion:** An attacker could delete comments made by other users, leading to loss of information and disruption of conversations.
*   **Potential for Misinformation:** Malicious users could alter or remove comments to spread false information or disrupt user engagement within the platform.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct API manipulation:** A malicious user could make direct API calls to `/comments.update` or `/comments.remove` with manipulated `comment_id` and/or `page_id` to affect comments created by other users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account within the GROWI application.
*   **Knowledge of comment ID:** The attacker needs to know the `comment_id` of the comment that they intend to modify or delete.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to communicate with the server via network requests.

**Changes Made:**

The commit `863bfd7f622f413bd159b9446166fb1ce78ec863` addresses this vulnerability by:
*   **Implementing author checks:** The server-side logic has been updated to verify that the user attempting to update or delete a comment is the actual creator of that comment.
*   **Removing redundant check:** The client side `checkPermissionToControlComment` function was changed from checking if a user was an admin or the author, to only checking if the user is the author.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the server-side logic which handles the comment update and delete requests.
*   The fix includes server-side checks to prevent unauthorized modification or deletion of comments.
*   The commit messages and code changes clearly highlight the intended fix, making it easy to understand.
