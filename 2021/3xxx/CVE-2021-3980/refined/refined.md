The provided content relates to a commit that addresses a vulnerability, specifically related to protecting admin forms from unauthorized AJAX requests.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Admin forms within the Elgg application were not being properly protected when accessed via AJAX requests. This was inconsistent with how admin pages were protected, creating a potential bypass for access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inconsistent access control enforcement between admin pages and admin forms accessed via AJAX.
- Lack of `AdminGatekeeper` for `ajax/form/admin` routes, which led to admin forms being accessible without proper authentication or authorization checks when requested via AJAX.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthenticated or unauthorized users could potentially access and submit admin forms, leading to privilege escalation, data manipulation, or other unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs through sending AJAX requests to `ajax/form/admin/*` routes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and send AJAX requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
- The attacker would either need to be logged in as a user (to bypass the logged-in gatekeeper) and not an admin, or not logged in at all to potentially exploit the lack of an admin gatekeeper.
