| Custom Fields   If you have a particular attribute you need to record, easily add it to the database and use it to report or even group devices. Open-AudIT can store information in custom fields that are associated with each device. Once a Field has been created it can be used in queries and groups just like any other attribute in the database. |  |  |  |

Export to CSV and analyze offline, or import into your favorite third party data visualizer. The power is in your hands with Open-AudIT Enterprise Enhanced Reporting. |  |  |  |
| Baselines for device comparison   Baselines is a lightweight compliance tool that checks if your devices meet your standards by comparing software, users, and netstat data. With Baselines, you can define a standard configuration and see if your devices align. For example, if you have a CentOS 6 server set up perfectly for Apache, Baselines helps you ensure other servers in the cluster match that configuration. Create and schedule Baselines to run on device groups, with results that can be viewed or exported. |  |  |  |
| Cloud Discovery and Audit   With the introduction of the Clouds feature, you can supply details of your cloud, Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure, and Open-AudIT will use the relevant API to retrieve a list of locations, networks, and instances, then discover each of these instances. Full cloud auditing with all the details from a regular Open-AudIT audit and details such as the machine type and size. Once you have your cloud credentials, it is merely a matter of creating a new cloud and running the discovery ‚Äì or scheduling first/future discoveries.

Clouds are a feature available to Open-AudIT Enterprise licensed customers. |  |  |  |
| Configurable Role Based Access Control (RBAC)   Open-AudIT Enterprise includes User Roles, offering full role-based access control (RBAC) for precise user management. Roles dictate what users can do within Open-AudIT. Default roles‚Äîadmin, org\_admin, reporter, and user‚Äîcome with specific permissions (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for each endpoint. Open-AudIT Enterprise allows you to create custom roles and modify existing ones.

Open-AudIT Enterprise also lets you create and modify custom roles. User Roles can integrate with LDAP (Active Directory and OpenLDAP), allowing Enterprise installations to customize LDAP groups for each role. |  |  |  |
| Customisable Scanning Options per Discovery   When a discovery is run, the relevant discovery scan option is chosen and those settings used by Nmap to scan the target devices. If no option set is chosen, the default configuration item (discovery\_default\_scan\_option) is selected and used. If a device is individually discovered using the ‚ÄúDiscover Device‚Äù link on the device details page, we first check if this device has been discovered previously (by Discovery) and if so, use the discovery options from that scan. If it has not been previously discovered, we revert to the configuration item discovery\_default\_scan\_option the settings. |  |  |  |
| File Auditing & Monitoring   Open-AudIT Enterprise includes Files, providing change control monitoring of individual files and folders on both Linux and Windows servers. Get the complete Open-AudIT Enterprise experience. Audit your computers and ensure any changed files are recorded. Open-AudIT can retrieve details about a file or directory of files and monitor these files for changes as per other attributes in the Open-AudIT database. Details such as name, directory, size, hash, last changed and permissions are all recorded. This feature works on both Windows and Linux target machines. This is ideal for monitoring configuration files in /etc on Linux machines (for example). |  |  |  |
| Rack Management and Reporting   A rack is a collection of devices assigned specific positions and heights within the rack. You can associate a device with a picture, either from the provided set or custom to your environment. Our system for organizing racks is highly detailed. At the top level is the Organization (Org), which can have multiple locations. With the Racks feature, each location can contain one or more buildings, each building can have multiple floors, each floor can have multiple rooms, and each room can have multiple rows. When you create a new location, its sub-components are automatically generated. You can add more buildings, rooms, or other elements as needed. Additionally, racks can be grouped into "pods," using the pod attribute as a tag rather than following the strict hierarchical model of buildings, floors, etc. Racks are available to Open-AudIT Enterprise licensed customers. |  |  |  |

Your complete satisfaction is our top priority; anything less is unacceptable. Open-AudIT is backed by FirstWave with unparalleled support. Prefer community-driven assistance? We've got that too.

How it Works

Open-AudIT is a tool that offers detailed information about the devices on your network, including their configurations and any changes that occur. It is designed to be installed on a server (Windows or Linux) and used to scan your networks for devices. When a device is found, Open-AudIT runs a series of commands on it and saves the resulting data in a database. This data can be used for various reporting purposes. Open-AudIT comes with a set of over 50 reports, and users can also create custom reports as needed.

Open-AudIT uses an agentless framework to audit your network on your schedule without impacting user experience. The device discovery engine scans your network and intelligently stores the configurations of every discovered component. This provides information such as hardware details, software licensing, configuration changes, non-authorized devices, capacity utilization, and hardware warranty status.
