Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3130:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The web interface of Open-AudIT uses HTML password fields to "obfuscate" sensitive credentials like SSH secrets, Windows passwords, and SNMP strings. This method relies on client-side obfuscation rather than proper server-side protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Insufficient Credential Protection:** The primary vulnerability is the inadequate protection of sensitive credentials. Hiding these credentials using HTML password fields is a weak form of obfuscation.
-   **Client-Side Security Flaw:** The vulnerability exists because the security relies on client-side mechanisms that can be easily bypassed using browser developer tools.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Credential Exposure:** An attacker can easily reveal stored credentials (SSH secrets, Windows passwords, and SNMP strings) by inspecting the HTML source or using browser developer tools.
-   **Potential Unauthorized Access:** The exposed credentials could then be used for unauthorized access to systems or resources, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Remote Access:** The attack is remote as it exploits a web interface vulnerability.
-   **Browser Manipulation:** Attackers leverage web browser developer tools to bypass the client-side obfuscation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Access to Open-AudIT Web Interface:** The attacker must have access to the web interface of the vulnerable Open-AudIT instance.
-   **Basic Web Development/Browser Skills:** The attacker must be able to use browser developer tools or inspect HTML source code to reveal the credentials.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Open-AudIT up to version 4.0.2
- The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor
- The affected product is Open-AudIT by Opmantek.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass client-side security and access sensitive credentials stored within the application, which could result in significant security breaches if not addressed.
