Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3637:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `keycloak-model-infinispan` component.
*   Specifically, the `authenticationSessions` map within the `RootAuthenticationSessionEntity` grows without any bounds. This unbounded growth is the core issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unbounded Resource Consumption:** The primary weakness is the lack of a limit on the size of the `authenticationSessions` map. This allows the map to consume an excessive amount of memory, potentially leading to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The unbounded growth of the map can lead to a denial-of-service condition. The excessive memory consumption can cause the application to become unresponsive or crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves creating a large number of authentication sessions. By repeatedly initiating new authentication attempts (or through other means of generating entries in the authenticationSessions map), an attacker can cause the map to grow rapidly, triggering the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to initiate new authentication sessions or otherwise interact with the application in a way that leads to the creation of entries in the `authenticationSessions` map.  This suggests that they would need to have network access to the Keycloak instance and be able to attempt authentication.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was identified in `keycloak-model-infinispan`.
*   The bug report mentions the relevant upstream issue as `KEYCLOAK-16616`.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Keycloak version 14.0.0.
*   Red Hat has released errata (RHSA-2021:3527, RHSA-2021:3528, RHSA-2021:3529, RHSA-2021:3534) to address this issue in Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.4 for RHEL 6, 7, 8 and 7.4.9.
