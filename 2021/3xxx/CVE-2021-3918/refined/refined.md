Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3918:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `__proto__` property during schema processing within the `node-json-schema` library. Specifically, the library was allowing the modification of object prototype attributes through the use of a crafted JSON schema containing a `__proto__` property.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes:** The core issue is that the library didn't sanitize or restrict the use of the `__proto__` property within JSON schemas. This allowed an attacker to inject a property that could modify the prototype of objects which is a classic prototype pollution vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially modify the prototype of JavaScript objects, leading to unpredictable behavior, denial of service, or possibly remote code execution in vulnerable applications that use the `node-json-schema` library. By setting a `__proto__` property in the JSON schema, the attacker can add or modify existing properties on the `Object.prototype`, affecting every object in the application.
- The provided example shows a test case where a prototype pollution is attempted on an empty object `a`, and the test case confirms that `a.polluted` remains undefined after the attempted pollution via a schema. The fix is meant to prevent prototype pollution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious JSON Schema:** The primary attack vector involves providing a malicious JSON schema that includes a `__proto__` property with attacker-controlled values. When this schema is processed by the vulnerable library, it can lead to prototype pollution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply or influence the JSON schema that is processed by the vulnerable `node-json-schema` library. This could be achieved in various scenarios such as when the application is fetching schemas from untrusted sources or when the application directly uses user-provided data in a schema.

**Additional details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves adding a check in `validate.js` to specifically exclude the `__proto__` property when processing properties of the input schema.
- The commit message "Don't allow \_\_proto\_\_ property to be used for schema default/coerce" and the code diffs in github.com confirm the vulnerability was resolved by specifically excluding `__proto__` from the processing logic of properties of a schema during validation.
