**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the presence of an XSS vulnerability. This implies that the application was not properly sanitizing user input before displaying it on a webpage.

    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of web pages
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Data theft
    *   Execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts, likely through user-provided input fields or other data that is rendered in a web page without proper sanitization.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need the ability to insert or manipulate data that gets displayed to other users on the OpenKM platform.
