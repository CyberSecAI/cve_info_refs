Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3179:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The GGLocker iOS application stores the hash of the user's password insecurely. Instead of using a secure storage mechanism like the keychain, it stores the hash in a location that can be accessed and tampered with.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Data Storage (MSTG-STORAGE-1 and MSTG-STORAGE-2):** The application does not protect the stored password hash. This allows an attacker to access or modify this stored hash.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The application validates user login by comparing the hash of the entered password with the stored hash. Due to the insecure storage and the ability to manipulate the stored hash, an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can gain access to the password vault without knowing the actual password.
*   **Data Breach:** Once inside the vault, the attacker can access all stored user credentials.
*   **Manipulation of Return Value:** An attacker can manipulate the return value of the password validation function, bypassing the need to input the correct password altogether.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Mobile Application Exploitation:** The attacker directly targets the GGLocker iOS application.
*   **Source Code Analysis:** The attacker inspects the application's source code from its GitHub page to understand the password validation mechanism.
*   **Code Injection/Hooking:** The attacker can use tools like Frida, Theos or Grapefruit to hook into the applicationâ€™s functions and manipulate the stored hash value or the validation process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Technical Skills:** The attacker needs to be skilled in reverse engineering, code injection/hooking, and mobile application security.
*   **Access to the Application:** The attacker needs access to the GGLocker iOS application binary.
*   **Debugging/Analysis Environment:** The attacker uses a debugging/analysis environment or tools to hook into the application's functions, such as a non-jailbroken iPhone with tools like Frida, Theos, or Grapefruit.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to the developer in December 2020 but was not addressed. A technical advisory was published in June 2021, and MITRE assigned CVE-2021-3179 in November 2021.
*   The attacker can bypass authentication by either providing a known hash value or by manipulating the return value of the login validation function.
*   The attacker can perform the attack on a non-jailbroken device, although it may be harder to achieve.
*   The article recommends implementing jailbreak detection and storing the hash in a secure location such as the keychain.
