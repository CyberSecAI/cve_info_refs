- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Padding bytes in Ethernet packets are not cleared before the data frame is created, leading to the leakage of random information from firewall memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information exposure due to the inclusion of uninitialized memory content in Ethernet packets.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker on the same Ethernet subnet can collect potentially sensitive information from the leaked memory contents in the Ethernet packets.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be on the same Ethernet subnet as the vulnerable PAN-OS firewall.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be on the same local network segment as the targeted firewall.
