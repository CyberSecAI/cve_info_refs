```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a path traversal issue in the Document Server, specifically related to handling file uploads. By manipulating the path in the upload request, an attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on the server.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Path Traversal vulnerability, Remote Code Execution.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary file write, which can lead to Remote Code Execution by uploading and executing malicious code.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves sending a crafted POST request to the `/upload` endpoint, embedding a path traversal sequence within the file path. Additionally, it utilizes a JWT token for authentication.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires network access to the Document Server and the ability to forge a JWT token. The attacker also needs knowledge of the target file path on the server to overwrite."
