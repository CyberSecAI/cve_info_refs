Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-3398:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A denial-of-service (DoS) attack against a Stormshield Network Security (SNS) cluster can disrupt the synchronization between the master and slave nodes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability lies in the cluster synchronization mechanism of SNS, making it susceptible to a DoS attack that can break the synchronization between master and slave nodes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to a "split-brain" scenario where both the master and slave appliances in the cluster become active simultaneously. This can lead to inconsistent states, data loss, service disruption and unpredictable behaviour within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be on the network and able to launch a DoS attack against the SNS cluster. No specific privileges or user interaction are needed.

**Additional Details:**
*   **Affected Products:** Stormshield Network Security (SNS)
*   **Affected Versions:** SNS versions 3.0.0 to 3.7.24 and 3.8.0 to 3.11.12
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** 5.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L)
