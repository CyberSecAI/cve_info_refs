# Exploiting Stored Cross-Site Scripting at Tenda AC5 AC1200

[January 24, 2021](https://www.hackingarticles.in/exploiting-stored-cross-site-scripting-at-tenda-ac5-ac1200/) by [Raj](https://www.hackingarticles.in/author/raj/)

While testing **Tenda AC5 AC1200** over at the Hacking Articles Research Lab, we uncovered several vulnerabilities in its latest firmware version **V15.03.06.47\_multi**.

Thereby in a heap of basic vulnerabilities, there was a one with the highest severity i.e. **Stored Cross-Site Scripting.**

So, let’s take a look at how we detected that.

### **Detecting & Exploiting the Vulnerability**

Navigating the Tenda AC1200 gateway IP i.e. **192.168.0.1** over at our browser, we got landed on the router’s main.html webpage. There we discovered that the Wi-Fi Names are displayed on the screen.

This made us scratch our head and we just switched to the Wifi Settings and hit the Wifi Name and the Password option.

And with that, we tried to manipulate the Wifi name with a Javascript code in order to hit a potential cross-site scripting attack.

```
<script>alert(1)</script>
```

Now as soon as the victim navigate back to the dashboard with the gateway IP, the browser executes up the payload dumping **“1” as an alert** over there.
