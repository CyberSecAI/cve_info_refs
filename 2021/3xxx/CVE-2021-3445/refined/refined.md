  "CVE-2021-3445": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in libdnf's signature verification functionality. This flaw allows an attacker to achieve code execution if they can alter the header information of an RPM package and then trick a user or system into installing it.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "libdnf does its own signature verification, but this can be tricked by placing a signature in the main header.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Signature verification bypass due to signature being placed in the main header.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Achieve code execution, potentially compromising confidentiality, integrity, and system availability.",
    "Attack vectors": "Altering the header information of an RPM package and then tricking a user or system into installing it.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must either compromise an RPM repository or convince an administrator to install an untrusted RPM. Requires RPM's package verification level to be set to 'digest' or 'none'."
