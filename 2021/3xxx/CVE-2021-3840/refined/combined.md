# Antilles Dependency Confusion Vulnerability

High

[yixuan178](/yixuan178)
published
GHSA-hgc3-hp6x-wpgx
Nov 3, 2021

## Package

pip

antilles-tools
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

1.0.0

## Patched versions

1.0.1

## Description

### Potential Impact:

Remote code execution

### Scope of Impact:

Open-source project specific

### Summary Description:

A dependency confusion vulnerability was reported in the Antilles open-source software prior to version 1.0.1 that could allow for remote code execution during installation due to a package listed in requirements.txt not existing in the public package index (PyPi).

MITRE classifies this weakness as an Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) in which a private package dependency may be replaced by an unauthorized package of the same name published to a well-known public repository such as PyPi.

The configuration has been updated to only install components built by Antilles, removing all other public package indexes. Additionally, the antilles-tools dependency has been published to PyPi.

### Mitigation Strategy for Customers (what you should do to protect yourself):

Remove previous versions of Antilles as a precautionary measure and Update to version 1.0.1 or later.

### Acknowledgement:

The Antilles team thanks Kotko Vladyslav for reporting this issue.
