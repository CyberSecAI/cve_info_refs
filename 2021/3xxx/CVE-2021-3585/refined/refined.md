Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-3585:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the inclusion of plain text passwords in the logs during OSP13 (OpenStack Platform 13) deployments when using the subscription-manager for Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Logging:** The primary weakness is the logging of sensitive information (RHSM passwords) in plain text within the `overcloud_install.log` file. This makes the credentials easily accessible if the log file is compromised.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Exposure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would lead to the exposure of RHSM usernames and passwords.
- **Unauthorized Access:**  With the exposed credentials, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the affected Red Hat subscriptions, potentially leading to further unauthorized access or actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Log File Access:** An attacker would need access to the `overcloud_install.log` file where the plain text passwords are logged during OSP13 deployments with subscription manager.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Logs:** The attacker must be able to access the server or system where `overcloud_install.log` is located. This access could be gained through a variety of means like network compromise or by compromising the server where the OpenStack deployment was done.
- **Knowledge of log location**: The attacker needs to know the location of the log file that is storing the credentials.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is specific to OpenStack TripleO Heat Templates when used with subscription-manager in OSP13, where the RHSM password is being logged in plain text.
- The issue was addressed by moving to an ansible role in later releases.
- The issue was found during OSP13 deployment when using the `subscription-manager`
- The `subscription-manager` command includes the user credentials with the `--username` and `--password` flags when registering to RHSM.
