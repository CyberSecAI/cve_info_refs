# CVE-2021-3975

| **Name** | CVE-2021-3975 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | A use-after-free flaw was found in libvirt. The qemuMonitorUnregister() function in qemuProcessHandleMonitorEOF is called using multiple threads without being adequately protected by a monitor lock. This flaw could be triggered by the virConnectGetAllDomainStats API when the guest is shutting down. An unprivileged client with a read-only connection could use this flaw to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt daemon to crash. |

A use-after-free flaw was found in libvirt. The qemuMonitorUnregister()
function in qemuProcessHandleMonitorEOF is called using multiple threads
without being adequately protected by a monitor lock. This flaw could be
triggered by the virConnectGetAllDomainStats API when the guest is shutting
down. An unprivileged client with a read-only connection could use this
flaw to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt daemon to
crash.

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in libvirt, a C toolkit to interact
with the virtualization capabilities of Linux, which could lead to
denial of service or information disclosure.

CVE-2020-10703

    A NULL pointer dereference was found in the libvirt API that is responsible for
    fetching a storage pool based on its target path.  In more detail, this flaw affects
    storage pools created without a target path such as network-based pools like gluster
    and RBD.  Unprivileged users with a read-only connection could abuse this flaw to
    crash the libvirt daemon, resulting in a potential denial of service.

CVE-2020-12430

    A memory leak was found in the virDomainListGetStats libvirt API that is responsible
    for retrieving domain statistics when managing QEMU guests.  This flaw allows
    unprivileged users with a read-only connection to cause a memory leak in the domstats
    command, resulting in a potential denial of service.

CVE-2020-25637

    A double free memory issue was found in the libvirt API that is responsible for
    requesting information about network interfaces of a running QEMU domain.  This flaw
    affects the polkit access control driver.  Specifically, clients connecting to the
    read-write socket with limited ACL permissions could use this flaw to crash the
    libvirt daemon, resulting in a denial of service, or potentially escalate their
    privileges on the system.  The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data
    confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.

CVE-2021-3631

    An issue was found in the generation of SELinux MCS category pairs for VMs' dynamic
    labels.  This flaw allows one exploited guest to access files labeled for another
    guest, resulting in the breaking out of sVirt confinement.

CVE-2021-3667

    An improper locking issue was found in the virStoragePoolLookupByTargetPath API.  It
    occurs in the storagePoolLookupByTargetPath function where a locked virStoragePoolObj
    object is not properly released on ACL permission failure.  Clients connecting to the
    read-write socket with limited ACL permissions could use this flaw to acquire the lock
    and prevent other users from accessing storage pool/volume APIs, resulting in a denial
    of service condition.

CVE-2021-3975

    A use-after-free issue was found in libvirt in qemuProcessHandleMonitorEOF(), where
    the qemuMonitorUnregister() function is called using multiple threads without being
    adequately protected by a monitor lock.  This flaw could be triggered by the
    virConnectGetAllDomainStats API when the guest is shutting down.  An unprivileged
    client with a read-only connection could use this flaw to perform a denial of service
    attack by causing the libvirt daemon to crash.

CVE-2021-4147

    Jim Fehlig discovered that a malicious guest using the libxl driver could cause
    libvirtd on the host to deadlock or crash when continuously rebooting itself.

CVE-2022-0897

    A flaw was found in the libvirt nwfilter driver.  The virNWFilterObjListNumOfNWFilters
    method failed to acquire the driver->nwfilters mutex before iterating over
    virNWFilterObj instances.  There was no protection to stop another thread from
    concurrently modifying the driver->nwfilters object.  This flaw allows a malicious,
    unprivileged user to exploit this issue via libvirt's API virConnectNumOfNWFilters to
    crash the network filter management daemon (libvirtd/virtnwfilterd).

CVE-2024-1441

    An off-by-one error flaw was found in the udevListInterfacesByStatus() function in
    libvirt when the number of interfaces exceeds the size of the `names` array.  This
    issue can be reproduced by sending specially crafted data to the libvirt daemon,
    allowing an unprivileged client to perform a denial of service attack by causing the
    libvirt daemon to crash.

CVE-2024-2494

    The ALT Linux Team discovered that the RPC server deserialization code allocates
    memory for arrays before the non-negative length check is performed by the C API entry
    points.  Passing a negative length therefore results in a crash due to the negative
    length being treated as a huge positive number.  This flaw allows a local,
    unprivileged user to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt daemon
    to crash.

CVE-2024-2496

    A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the udevConnectListAllInterfaces()
    function.  This issue can occur when detaching a host interface while at the same time
    collecting the list of interfaces via virConnectListAllInterfaces API.  This flaw
    could be used to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt daemon to
    crash.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
5.0.0-4+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libvirt packages.

# CVE 2021-3975

A use-after-free flaw was found in libvirt. The qemuMonitorUnregister() function in qemuProcessHandleMonitorEOF is called using multiple threads without being adequately protected by a monitor lock. This flaw could be triggered by the virConnectGetAllDomainStats API when the guest is shutting down. An unprivileged client with a read-only connection could use this flaw to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt daemon to crash.

qemu: Add missing lock in qemuProcessHandleMonitorEOF

```
qemuMonitorUnregister will be called in multiple threads (e.g. threads
in rpc worker pool and the vm event thread).  In some cases, it isn't
protected by the monitor lock, which may lead to call g_source_unref
more than one time and a use-after-free problem eventually.

Add the missing lock in qemuProcessHandleMonitorEOF (which is the only
position missing lock of monitor I found).

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2022%3A1759)

## Topic

An update for the virt:rhel and virt-devel:rhel modules is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) offers a full virtualization solution for Linux on numerous hardware platforms. The virt:rhel module contains packages which provide user-space components used to run virtual machines using KVM. The packages also provide APIs for managing and interacting with the virtualized systems.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: qemu-kvm (6.2.0), libvirt (8.0.0), libvirt-python (8.0.0), perl-Sys-Virt (8.0.0), seabios (1.15.0), libtpms (0.9.1). (BZ#1997410, BZ#2012802, BZ#2012806, BZ#2012813, BZ#2018392, BZ#2027716, BZ#2029355)

* ntfs-3g: Out-of-bounds access in ntfs\_inode\_sync\_standard\_information() (CVE-2021-39260)
* ntfs-3g: Heap buffer overflow in ntfs\_compressed\_pwrite() (CVE-2021-39261)
