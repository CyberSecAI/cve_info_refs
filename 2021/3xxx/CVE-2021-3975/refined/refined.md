Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-3975:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a use-after-free error in the `libvirt` library.
*   The `qemuMonitorUnregister()` function, which is called within `qemuProcessHandleMonitorEOF()`, is being invoked by multiple threads concurrently without adequate protection from a monitor lock.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Use-after-free:** The lack of proper synchronization when calling `qemuMonitorUnregister()` can lead to a scenario where a memory location is freed, but a thread might still try to access this freed memory, causing undefined behavior.
*   **Missing monitor lock:** The core problem is the absence of a monitor lock around the `qemuMonitorUnregister()` call, which allows concurrent access from different threads.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of service:** The vulnerability can be exploited to cause the `libvirt` daemon to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered using the `virConnectGetAllDomainStats` API when a guest virtual machine is in the process of shutting down.
*   This API call, combined with guest shutdown events, causes the vulnerable code path to be executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An unprivileged client with a read-only connection to `libvirt` can trigger the vulnerability.
*   No special permissions or capabilities are required besides the ability to interact with the `libvirt` API over a network connection.
