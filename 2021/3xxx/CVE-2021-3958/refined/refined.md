- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to insufficient sanitization or validation of the `username` parameter in the login process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could compromise the application, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify data, or potentially exploit other latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted request with a malicious SQL payload in the `username` parameter to the `login_check.php` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `login_check.php` endpoint with a crafted `username` parameter.
