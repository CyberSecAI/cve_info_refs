Based on the provided content, this commit addresses a ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerability by correcting incorrectly specified regular expressions.

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stemmed from the use of inefficient regular expressions in several files within the `nltk` library, specifically when handling cardinal numbers. These regexes were vulnerable to backtracking, which could lead to a denial-of-service attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- Inefficient Regular Expressions: The original regular expression `r"^-?[0-9]+(.[0-9]+)?$"` (used to match cardinal numbers) was identified as problematic. This regex could cause excessive backtracking when encountering specially crafted input strings, potentially leading to denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker could exploit the vulnerable regular expressions by providing specially crafted input strings that cause the regex engine to enter a state of excessive backtracking. This would consume excessive CPU and memory resources, making the system unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Input Manipulation: The attack vector involves providing crafted strings as input to functions that use the vulnerable regular expressions, causing excessive backtracking.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker would need to have the ability to provide input to the affected functions. This could be through direct user input or via a data source that utilizes these functions.

**Technical Details:**

The commit replaces the problematic regular expression `r"^-?[0-9]+(.[0-9]+)?$"` with `r"^-?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$"`. The change is subtle but crucial: the dot `.` inside the character class `(.[0-9]+)` was not escaped, and was thus interpreted as a "any character" placeholder instead of the literal dot. This caused the regex to try every combination of characters when matching input, which could cause it to be very slow for some input string. By escaping the dot, the regex will now try only to match the literal dot.

The fix involves modifying the following files:

- `nltk/parse/malt.py`
- `nltk/sem/glue.py`
- `nltk/tag/brill.py`
- `nltk/tag/brill_trainer.py`
- `nltk/tag/sequential.py`
- `nltk/tbl/demo.py`

The fix is a simple replacement of the vulnerable regex with a corrected version across multiple files in the `nltk` library.
