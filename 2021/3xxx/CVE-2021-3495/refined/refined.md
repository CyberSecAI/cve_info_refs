{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Kiali Operator does not properly restrict the namespace where it can install a specified image.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper access control",
      "Namespace bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with the ability to create or edit a Kiali CR (Custom Resource) can deploy a specified image to any namespace in the cluster, potentially gaining access to privileged service account tokens. This can lead to data confidentiality and integrity issues as well as system availability problems.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a Kiali CR with an unapproved namespace specified, the operator installs the provided image into that namespace regardless of the user's permissions for that namespace.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create or edit Kiali CRs (resources of kind 'kiali'). This implies some level of privileged access within the cluster."
