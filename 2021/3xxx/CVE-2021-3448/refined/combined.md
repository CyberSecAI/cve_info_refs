# Dnsmasq: DNS cache poisoning — GLSA **202105-20**

Use of insufficient randomness in Dnsmasq might lead to DNS Cache
Poisoning.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-dns/dnsmasq** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.85** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.85** |

### Background

Dnsmasq is a lightweight and easily-configurable DNS forwarder and DHCP
server.

### Description

It was discovered that Dnsmasq, when configured with
--server=<address>@ or similar (e.g. through dbus),
configured a fixed UDP port for all outgoing queries to the specified
upstream DNS server.

### Impact

An attacker, by sending malicious crafted DNS responses, could perform a
DNS Cache Poisoning attack.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Dnsmasq users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/dnsmasq-2.85"

```

2021-04-24 20:00:51.078610

Name : dnsmasq
Product : Fedora 34
Version : 2.85
Release : 1.fc34
URL : <http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/>
Summary : A lightweight DHCP/caching DNS server
Description :
Dnsmasq is lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP server.
It is designed to provide DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a small network.
It can serve the names of local machines which are not in the global
DNS. The DHCP server integrates with the DNS server and allows machines
with DHCP-allocated addresses to appear in the DNS with names configured
either in each host or in a central configuration file. Dnsmasq supports
static and dynamic DHCP leases and BOOTP for network booting of diskless
machines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Security fix for CVE-2021-3448 - Changes service to type=forking. Would report
failure on start back to systemctl start immediately. - Changes default of pid

2021-04-24 18:22:56.814871

Name : dnsmasq
Product : Fedora 32
Version : 2.85
Release : 1.fc32
URL : <http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/>
Summary : A lightweight DHCP/caching DNS server
Description :
Dnsmasq is lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP server.
It is designed to provide DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a small network.
It can serve the names of local machines which are not in the global
DNS. The DHCP server integrates with the DNS server and allows machines
with DHCP-allocated addresses to appear in the DNS with names configured
either in each host or in a central configuration file. Dnsmasq supports
static and dynamic DHCP leases and BOOTP for network booting of diskless
machines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary : A lightweight DHCP/caching DNS server
Description :
Dnsmasq is lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP server.
It is designed to provide DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a small network.
It can serve the names of local machines which are not in the global
DNS. The DHCP server integrates with the DNS server and allows machines
with DHCP-allocated addresses to appear in the DNS with names configured
either in each host or in a central configuration file. Dnsmasq supports
static and dynamic DHCP leases and BOOTP for network booting of diskless
machines.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1939368#c0)  Riccardo Schirone    2021-03-16 08:56:08 UTC  ``` When configured with --server=<address>@<interface> or similar (e.g. through dbus), dnsmasq configures a fixed UDP port for all outgoing queries to the specified upstream DNS server. If an attacker is able to discover the opened port through other means (e.g. port scanning, guessing or sniffing), he would just have to guess the random transmission ID to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This flaw could be abused to perform a DNS Cache Poisoning attack.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1939368#c1)  Riccardo Schirone    2021-03-16 08:57:46 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Petr Mensik (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1939368#c3)  Riccardo Schirone    2021-03-16 09:30:03 UTC  ``` When dns=dnsmasq is set in NetworkManager.conf, NetworkManager configures dnsmasq with the equivalent of --server=<address>@<interface>, enabling the preconditions to trigger this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1939368#c4)  Riccardo Schirone    2021-03-16 09:51:16 UTC  ``` To exploit this flaw, an attacker has to be able to: 1) initiate a DNS query to the dnsmasq server 2) forge a reply with the upstream DNS server as source IP 3) make the forged reply arrive before the real one 4) know, through other means, the fixed outgoing port used by dnsmasq 5) guess the transmission ID, composed of 16bits  In a not-vulnerable configuration, an attacker would have to guess the right combination of (outgoing-port;transmission ID). Due to this flaw however, he just needs to find out the outgoing port through other means, like sniffing, scanning, etc. Once the outgoing port is discovered, it can be used to guess the transmission ID in a quicker way, due to the port being reused for all queries going through the same interface.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1939368#c9)  Riccardo Schirone    2021-03-17 10:51:22 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  The flaw can be prevented by removing `--server=<address>@<interface>` option or by removing the directive `server=<address>@<interface>`. If dnsmasq is being run through NetworkManager, please be aware that NetworkManager automatically configures dnsmasq to use the `server=<address>@<interface>` directive, thus in this case the only way to prevent the flaw is to remove `dns=dnsmasq` from /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf file.  If the `server=<address>@<interface>` must be kept active, the impact of this flaw can be reduced by disabling the dnsmasq cache by adding `--cache-size=0` when calling dnsmasq or by adding a line with `cache-size=0` to the dnsmasq configuration file (/etc/dnsmasq.conf by default). If dnsmasq is being run through NetworkManager, create a new file in /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/ and add `cache-size=0` to it.  By disabling the cache, you may experience a performance loss in your environment due to all DNS queries being forwarded to the upstream servers. Please evaluate if the mitigation is appropriate for the system’s environment before applying.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1939368#c10)  Riccardo Schirone    2021-03-17 11:08:37 UTC  ``` Created dnsmasq tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1939965](show_bug.cgi?id=1939965 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2021-3448 dnsmasq: fixed outgoing port used when --server is used with an interface name [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1939368#c13)  Riccardo Schirone    2021-04-08 07:51:52 UTC  ``` Upstream fixes: <https://thekelleys.org.uk/gitweb/?p=dnsmasq.git;a=commit;h=74d4fcd756a85bc1823232ea74334f7ccfb9d5d2>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1939368#c14)  Riccardo Schirone    2021-04-08 07:52:32 UTC  ``` dnsmasq 2.85, which fixes this issue, announced: <https://lists.thekelleys.org.uk/pipermail/dnsmasq-discuss/2021q2/014962.html>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1939368#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-11-09 17:25:22 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2021:4153 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4153](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A4153)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1939368#c18)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-11-09 18:23:38 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 497 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [January 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2832416.1).

**Please note that on December 10, 2021, Oracle released a Security Alert for Apache Log4j vulnerabilities [CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2021-44228.html). Customers should review the Alert if they have not already done so.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.
