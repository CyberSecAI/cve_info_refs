Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) issue in the Mk-Auth system. Specifically, the application does not properly validate user authorization when accessing invoice data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **IDOR:** The system allows access to invoice information based on a user-controlled invoice ID, without verifying if the logged-in user is authorized to view the requested invoice.
*   **Authorization Bypass:** Any authenticated user can manipulate the `titulo` parameter in the `recibo.php` endpoint to access invoices that do not belong to them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can leak sensitive information of other users, such as CPF numbers and potentially other personal details included in the invoices.
*   **Privacy Violation:** Unauthorized access and exposure of sensitive user data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the web interface.
*   **HTTP GET Request Manipulation:** Attackers can modify the `titulo` parameter in a GET request to access arbitrary invoice data. For example:
    `GET /central/recibo.php?titulo=00006 HTTP/1.1`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** Attackers must be a valid, authenticated user of the Mk-Auth platform. This means they already have some level of access to the system (e.g., as a client of the Internet Service Provider).
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** Attackers need to know the vulnerable URL (`/central/recibo.php`) and the parameter (`titulo`).
*   **Basic HTTP Request Manipulation:** Attackers must be able to modify the `titulo` parameter in an HTTP GET request.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is present in MK-Auth version 19.01 :: K4.9, and likely affects previous versions.
* The discovered vulnerability is categorized as CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key.
* The vulnerability was discovered by Alan Lacerda and Filipe Cordeiro.
