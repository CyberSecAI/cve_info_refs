- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unsafe deserialization of Terraform files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Deserialization of untrusted data (CWE-502) leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Processing a malicious terraform file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker needs to provide a malicious terraform file and have a user with high privileges run Checkov on it.
