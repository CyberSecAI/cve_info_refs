Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control and improper handling of file uploads in Church Rota version 2.6.4. Specifically, the application allows authenticated users to upload arbitrary files, including PHP files, through the `resources.php` endpoint, regardless of whether they have explicit file upload permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application lacks proper validation and restrictions on file uploads, allowing users to upload executable PHP files.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The application does not properly enforce access control mechanisms to prevent users without file upload permissions from uploading files via `resources.php`.
*   **Direct File Execution:** Uploaded files are stored within the `documents/` directory, making them directly accessible and executable through HTTP requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading and executing a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Church Rota application.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Depending on the server configuration and permissions of the web server user, an attacker could potentially gain full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is initiated by sending a specially crafted POST request to the `/resources.php?action=newsent` endpoint, including a malicious PHP file as part of a multipart form.
*   **Direct File Access:** Once uploaded, the malicious file is accessed directly via a web request, triggering the execution of the embedded PHP code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account and be authenticated to the Church Rota application. No elevated privileges are required.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Church Rota server.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit request shows the following:

*   The attacker sends a `POST` request to `/resources.php?action=newsent`
*   The `Content-Type` header is set to `multipart/form-data` to upload files
*   The malicious php file (named exec.php in the example) is passed as a parameter named `resourcefile`
*   The file is then accessed directly using a curl command
