{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the 'email' parameter within the `/req_password_user.php` script.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially bypass authentication, leak sensitive data (e.g., database structure and content), or even gain unauthorized access to the system by manipulating SQL queries. The `selected_db` parameter can also be leaked.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting malicious SQL queries within the `email` parameter of a GET request to `/req_password_user.php`.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint."

  "affected_software": {
    "name": "ECSIMAGING PACS",
    "versions": "6.21.5 and below (tested on 6.21.5, 6.21.3)"
  },
  "additional_information": "The exploit database entry provides example payloads to demonstrate the SQL injection vulnerability, including a union-based SQL injection and a boolean based SQL injection. It also suggests using sqlmap for automated exploitation."
