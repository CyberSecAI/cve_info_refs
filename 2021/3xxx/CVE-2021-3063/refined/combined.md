### Description

An improper handling of exceptional conditions vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect portal and gateway interfaces that enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to send specifically crafted traffic to a GlobalProtect interface that causes the service to stop responding. Repeated attempts to send this request result in denial of service to all PAN-OS services by restarting the device and putting it into maintenance mode.

This issue impacts:

PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.21;

PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.14-h4;

PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.11-h3;

PAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.8-h4;

PAN-OS 10.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.1.3.

Prisma Access customers are not impacted by this issue.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 10.1 | < 10.1.3 | >= 10.1.3 |
| PAN-OS 10.0 | < 10.0.8-h4 | >= 10.0.8-h4 |
| PAN-OS 9.1 | < 9.1.11-h3 | >= 9.1.11-h3 |
| PAN-OS 9.0 | < 9.0.14-h4 | >= 9.0.14-h4 |
| PAN-OS 8.1 | < 8.1.21 | >= 8.1.21 |
| Prisma Access 2.2 | None | All |
| Prisma Access 2.1 | None | All |

### Required Configuration for Exposure

This issue is applicable only to PAN-OS firewall configurations with a GlobalProtect portal or gateway enabled. You can verify whether you have a GlobalProtect portal or gateway configured by checking for entries in 'Network > GlobalProtect > Portals' and in 'Network > GlobalProtect > Gateways' from the web interface.

### Severity: HIGH

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
7.5 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H))

### Exploitation Status

Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

### Weakness Type

[CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/755 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/755")

### Solution

This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.21, PAN-OS 9.0.14-h4, PAN-OS 9.1.11-h3, PAN-OS 10.0.8-h4, PAN-OS 10.1.3, and all later PAN-OS versions.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

Enable signatures for Unique Threat IDs 91820 and 91855 on traffic destined for GlobalProtect interfaces to block attacks against CVE-2021-3063.

It is not necessary to enable SSL decryption to detect and block attacks against this issue.
