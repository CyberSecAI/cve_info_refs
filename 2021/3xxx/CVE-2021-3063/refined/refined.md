- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of exceptional conditions in Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect portal and gateway interfaces.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of exceptional conditions. Specifically, the software does not correctly manage certain error states or unexpected inputs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated, network-based attacker can send specifically crafted traffic to a GlobalProtect interface, causing the service to stop responding. Repeated attempts can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS), causing the device to restart and enter maintenance mode, impacting all PAN-OS services.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based, unauthenticated attacker sending specially crafted packets to a GlobalProtect interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable GlobalProtect interface. No authentication is required.
