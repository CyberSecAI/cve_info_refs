Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3696:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the handling of Huffman tables within the PNG reader in GRUB2. Specifically, when decoding data within the Huffman table of a PNG file's header, an out-of-bounds write can occur in GRUB's heap.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Out-of-bounds write:**  A crafted PNG image can cause GRUB2 to write data beyond the allocated buffer during Huffman table processing.
- **Heap corruption:** The out-of-bounds write leads to memory corruption in the heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Data corruption:** The out-of-bounds write leads to corruption of data in heap memory.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** While the provided information notes it's complex to control the encoding and positioning for arbitrary code execution or secure boot circumvention, the heap corruption could potentially be leveraged to achieve such goals under specific conditions.  The Red Hat bugzilla entry indicates a low impact for Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability, but the Gentoo advisory highlights secure boot bypass as a possibility.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory corruption caused by the vulnerability could lead to instability and a denial of service in the system's boot process.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Crafted PNG image:** The vulnerability is triggered by loading a specially crafted PNG image.
- **Local access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to introduce the malicious image during the boot process.  This usually means physical access, or via remote management tools that might be able to modify the boot configuration.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker must have the ability to load a malicious PNG image during the GRUB boot process. This often requires local access to the system. This may include physical access, or the ability to modify boot configuration through remote management or other means.
- The attacker does not require user interaction.

**Additional notes:**

- The Gentoo advisory indicates this vulnerability, along with others, can allow secure boot bypass.
- The Red Hat Bugzilla entry notes that the vulnerability has a low impact for confidentiality, integrity, and availability due to the complexity of controlling the corruption of Huffman entries, yet the possibility of exploiting this for arbitrary code execution is mentioned.
- NetApp states that successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS), but indicates that their products are not affected by this issue.
- The vulnerability was fixed in GRUB version 2.12 according to Red Hat's bugzilla information.
