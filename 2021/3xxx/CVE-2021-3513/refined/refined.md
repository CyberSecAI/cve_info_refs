Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3513:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Keycloak's brute force detection mechanism. Specifically, even when the "permanent lockout" feature is enabled, an attacker can still attempt login attempts. The system incorrectly informs the attacker when the correct password is entered, even if the account is locked due to previous failed attempts, thus revealing valid credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Bypass of Account Lockout:** The primary weakness is the ineffective implementation of the permanent lockout feature. It fails to prevent brute-force attacks because it reveals when the correct credentials have been entered even if the account is locked.
- **Informative Error Message:** Instead of a generic error, the system provides specific feedback, indicating that the account is locked but the provided password is correct, enabling an attacker to confirm successful password guesses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credentials Exposure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to identify valid credentials through brute force attempts, even when the lockout feature is active, resulting in compromised user accounts.
- **Confidentiality Breach:**  The main impact is a breach of confidentiality, as attackers can gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Brute-Force Attack:** The primary attack vector is a brute-force password guessing attack against Keycloak accounts.
- **Login Interface:** The vulnerability is exposed through Keycloak's login interface, where the attacker attempts to authenticate with different password combinations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Keycloak instance's login page.
- **Automated Tooling:** The attacker likely uses automated tools to carry out the brute force attempts efficiently.
- **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic understanding of password attacks and the Keycloak login process.
