Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2021-3540:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is insufficient sanitization of input provided to the `install rpm info detail` command. Specifically, the `CMD_STRING` type, as defined in the `types.xml` file, does not sanitize user input. This allows for injection of arbitrary arguments into the `rpm` command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Argument Injection (CWE-88):** The `install rpm info detail` command allows injection of arbitrary arguments into the `rpm` command, because it does not sanitize the input supplied via the `pkg` parameter of type `CMD_STRING`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** By injecting malicious arguments into the `rpm` command, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. In the provided exploit, the attacker uses the `-E%{lua:rpm.interactive()}` argument to invoke the Lua interpreter and then uses `os.execute("/bin/sh")` to spawn a root shell.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the `clish` restricted shell's `install rpm info detail` command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have access to the `clish` restricted shell and the password to enable privileged commands (using the `enable` command). This could be an insider or an external attacker who has compromised an account with such access.
