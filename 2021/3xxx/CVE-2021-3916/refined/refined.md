Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stemmed from the way the `showImage` function in `app/Http/Controllers/Images/ImageController.php` was handling image paths. It directly used `storage_path('uploads/images/' . $path)` to construct the full path to the image file. This allowed for path traversal, where an attacker could use `..` sequences in the `$path` parameter to access files outside of the intended `uploads/images` directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is path traversal. By manipulating the `$path` variable in the `showImage` function, an attacker could potentially access any file on the server that the webserver user has access to.
*   **Insecure Direct Object References:** The application was using a direct reference to the file system based on user-controlled input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could read sensitive files such as configuration files, log files, or even source code, potentially leading to the disclosure of credentials or other sensitive information.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:**  The disclosed information could be used to perform more complex attacks or gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** An attacker could craft a malicious HTTP request to the `showImage` endpoint, providing a path that includes `..` sequences to traverse up the directory tree. For example, `/uploads/images/../../../../etc/passwd` could attempt to access the `/etc/passwd` file on the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application.
*   **Understanding of File System Paths:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of file system structure and how path traversal works.

**Mitigation:**

The commit addresses this vulnerability by:

1.  **Introducing `ImageService::pathExistsInLocalSecure()`:** This function is used to check if the provided path exists within the secure image storage location and ensures it's an image before serving the file.
2.  **Switching to `ImageService::streamImageFromStorageResponse()`:** The response is now generated by `streamImageFromStorageResponse()`, which streams the image data rather than directly using the file path, preventing the possibility of path traversal.
3.  **Modifying `AttachmentService` and `ImageService`:** The code was refactored to use `getStorageDisk()` instead of `getStorage()`. Also, the code now uses `adjustPathForStorageDisk()` to ensure that paths are always within the defined storage location.
4.  **Adding Test Cases:**  The `tests/Uploads/ImageTest.php` file has been updated to include tests that specifically check for path traversal attempts, making sure that such attempts now result in a 500 error (if using local secure storage) or 404. Additionally, it now checks that non-image files cannot be served.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The changes also include some refactoring related to storage disks, specifically using `getStorageDisk()` instead of `getStorage()` to retrieve the storage instance which seems to be a part of the fix.
*   The commit message, "Updated showImage file serving to not be traversable", directly indicates the intention of the changes.
*   The commit includes changes in multiple files, indicating that this fix involves adjustments across different parts of the system.

This commit effectively addresses the path traversal vulnerability by introducing validation of the requested path and preventing access to files outside of the intended image storage location.
