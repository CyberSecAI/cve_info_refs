| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1975623#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2021-06-24 05:18:10 UTC  ``` As per the researchers:  ALPACA is an application layer protocol content confusion attack, exploiting TLS servers implementing different protocols but using compatible certificates, such as multi-domain or wildcard certificates. Attackers can redirect traffic from one subdomain to another, resulting in a valid TLS session. This breaks the authentication of TLS and cross-protocol attacks may be possible where the behavior of one protocol service may compromise the other at the application layer.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1975623#c2)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2021-06-24 06:11:28 UTC  ``` Analysis:  The generic attack requires a MitM attacker that can intercept and divert the victim's traffic at the TCP/IP layer.The attacker needs to have some way of intercepting and modifying the data sent from the victim’s browser to the web server. This is difficult on the Internet, but can be a plausible attacker model on the local network. The more dangerous variation of this attack requires the victim to use Microsoft Internet explorer and therefore Linux users are generally not vulnerable to them.  How the attack works:   The ALPACA attack is only possible because TLS does not protect the source or destination IP and port address of the TCP connection. As is stated in the TLS RFC, TLS is application layer independent. However, this gap in protection gives the attacker the flexibility to redirect traffic from one server to another, making the cross-protocol attack possible.  Basic idea behind application layer cross-protocol attacks on HTTPS. A MitM attacker leads the victim to an attacker-controlled website that triggers a cross-origin HTTPS request with a specially crafted FTP payload.  The attacker then redirects the request to an FTP server that has a certificate compatible with the web server. The attack either (1) uploads a secret cookie to FTP, or (2) downloads a stored malicious JavaScript file from FTP, or (3) reflects malicious JavaScript contained in the request. In case (2) and (3), the JavaScript code is executed in the context of the targeted web service.  Conditions required for the attack to work:  1. As per mentioned above you need a MiTM atack who can divert victim's traffic at the TCP/IP layer and therefore the only plausible attack model is on the local network.  2. If you are hosting several TLS-enabled application servers on the same hostname, or if you use multi-domain certificates, or if you use wild-card certificates, you may be vulnerable to the general confusion attack.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1975623#c3)  Huzaifa S.

As soon as a command contains an HTTP status line or a key-value pair separated by a colon, the server will immediately terminate the connection. Therefore it is resistant to this attack.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1975623#c13)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2021-06-29 05:11:36 UTC  ``` Sendmail:  "Sendmail only detects HTTP requests at the very start of a connection. If STARTTLS is used, the first command inside the connection can bensent by the attacker, bypassing the detection" Sendmail fixed a bug to detect HTTP requests when STARTTLS is used in 8.16  As per the release notes:  	SECURITY: If sendmail tried to reuse an SMTP session which had 		already been closed by the server, then the connection 		cache could have invalid information about the session. 		One possible consequence was that STARTTLS was not 		used even if offered.  This problem has been fixed 		by clearing out all relevant status information 		when a closed session is encountered.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1975623#c15)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2021-06-29 05:15:57 UTC  ``` Dovecot:  POP3.All POP3 servers were tolerant towards HTTP request and header lines.Dovecot POP3 implements a counter that resets after valid commands.   However,  with only three  consecutive  errors allowed, and the restrictions of the POP3 protocol, it seems highly unlikely that an attacker can bypass the error limit by inserting attacker-controlled header lines to reset the counter.As for reflection,  Dovecot POP3 allows XSS reflection only post-authentication using an unknown command. For all other POP3 servers we could not find any reflection vectors.  Therefore dovecot is not affected.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1975623#c19)  Tapas Jena    2021-07-07 16:44:25 UTC  ``` Analysis is complete for Ansible and it was found that Ansible is using the vulnerable version of nginx i.e. v1.16.1.

## Introduction

TLS is an internet standard to secure the communication
between servers and clients on the internet, for example
that of web servers, FTP servers, and Email servers. This
is possible because TLS was designed to be application
layer independent, which allows its use in many diverse
communication protocols.

ALPACA is an application layer protocol content confusion
attack, exploiting TLS servers implementing different
protocols but using compatible certificates, such as multi-domain
or wildcard certificates. Attackers can redirect traffic
from one subdomain to another, resulting in a valid TLS session.
This breaks the authentication of TLS and cross-protocol attacks
may be possible where the behavior of one protocol service may compromise
the other at the application layer.

We investigate cross-protocol attacks on TLS in general and
conducted a systematic case study on web servers, redirecting HTTPS
requests from a victim's web browser to SMTP, IMAP, POP3, and FTP
servers. We show that in realistic scenarios, the attacker can
extract session cookies and other private user data or execute
arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the vulnerable web server,
therefore bypassing TLS and web application security.

We evaluated the real-world attack surface of web browsers
and widely-deployed Email and FTP servers in lab experiments
and with internet-wide scans. We find that 1.4M web servers
are generally vulnerable to cross-protocol attacks, i.e., TLS
application data confusion is possible. Of these, 114k web servers
can be attacked using an exploitable application server. As a
countermeasure, we propose the use of the Application Layer Protocol
Negotiation (ALPN) and Server Name Indication (SNI) extensions in
TLS to prevent these and other cross-protocol attacks.

Although this vulnerability is very situational and can be challenging
to exploit, there are some configurations that are exploitable
even by a pure web attacker. Furthermore, we could only analyze
a limited number of protocols, and other attack scenarios may exist.
Thus, we advise that administrators review their deployments and
that application developers (client and server) implement
countermeasures proactively for all protocols.

## Attack Overview

![](media/img/alpaca-overview.png)

The image shows three possible ways for an attacker to use
cross-protocol attacks against webservers, exploiting vulnerable
FTP and Email servers: In the Upload Attack, the attacker exfiltrates authentication cookies or other private
data.
In the Download Attack, the attacker executes a stored XSS attack.
In the Reflection Attack, the attacker executes a reflected
XSS in the context of the victim website.

## FAQ

### I am an admin, should I drop everything and fix this?

Probably not. For the ALPACA attack to succeed, many
preconditions need to be fulfilled. The generic attack
requires a MitM attacker that can intercept and divert the
victim's traffic at the TCP/IP layer. However, if you run
application servers such as FTP and email on non-standard
ports that are not blocked by browsers, you should make sure
that you are not vulnerable to the web attacker variant of
ALPACA that can affect users of Internet Explorer.

### What can the attackers gain?

For the specific attacks on HTTPS described in the paper,
the attacker can potentially steal cookies or perform a cross-site
scripting attacks.

However, the potential consequences to the general ALPACA attack are
dependent on the interactions of two unknown protocols, so any number
of undesirable behaviors may be possible.

### Who is vulnerable?

This is difficult to answer. The general flaw behind ALPACA
is within the server authentication of TLS, so potentially all TLS servers
are affected that have compatible certificates with other TLS services.
In regards to that, all those servers have to be considered vulnerable.
However, for practical purposes, this definition is not very useful, as the
flaw is exploitable only in some cases. We therefore distinguish between
vulnerable servers and exploitable services. Our analysis was limited
to only a few protocols and a small number of implementations, so we
can really only make clear statements for those. From our analysis, the
following is generally true:

* Sharing certificates between a Webserver and an FTP server is almost
  always dangerous if an attacker has write access to the FTP server.
  It is sometimes dangerous if the attacker has no write access.
* Sharing certificates between a Webserver and an SMTP/POP3/IMAP server
  is sometimes dangerous, depending on the exact behavior of the server.

Here is a list of analyzed implementations in regards to their vulnerability (see Table 3 in the paper):
Sendmail SMTP allowed reflection attacks that work in Internet Explorer when
used over STARTTLS. Cyrus, Kerio Connect and Zimbra IMAP servers allowed
download and reflection attacks that work in Internet Explorer. Courier,
Cyrus, Kerio Connect and Zimbra allowed download attacks that work in Internet Explorer. Microsoft IIS, vsftpd,
FileZilla Server and Serv-U FTP servers allowed reflection attacks that work in Internet Explorer. And the same
FTP servers allowed upload and download attacks that work in all browsers.

But even then there are interactions with analyzed and not yet analyzed
protocols which makes a risk estimation difficult, since we believe that
there is a large number of yet undiscovered vulnerabilities in this area.

Browsers are generally affected by the vulnerability, but they are not
responsible for the flaw. We found that some browsers are more vulnerable
than others because of how they react to non-HTTP responses.

### So how practical is the attack?

Most attacks require an active Man-in-the-Middle attacker, that means some way
for an attacker to intercept and modify the data sent from the victim’s browser
to the web server. This is difficult on the Internet, but can be a plausible
attacker model on the local network. Also, some attack variations do not
require a Man-in-the-Browser, and thus are more dangerous. In particular,
if you are still using Internet Explorer, we recommend you update to the
latest version from June 8th, 2021.

### Is my website/ftp-server/mail-server vulnerable?

It might be. If you are hosting several TLS-enabled application servers
on the same hostname, or if you use multi-domain certificates, or if you
use wild-card certificates, you may be vulnerable to the general
confusion attack. If one of the application servers you are hosting
has an exploitable upload, download, or reflection vector, this may
negatively impact the security of your webserver.

### Is my browser/client vulnerable?

Internet Explorer and Edge Legacy (i.e., those not based on Chrome)
are "more" vulnerable than other browsers, because they block fewer ports and
perform content-sniffing. Content-sniffing is dangerous, because it enables
JavaScript code execution in server responses that are noisy due to error
messages by the application server that implements a protocol different
from HTTP. This means that the pure web attacker variant of ALPACA is more
dangerous for users of such browsers than for other users.

However, no browser protects the user against all possible ALPACA attacks.
In particular, all browsers can be compromised by a Man-in-the-Middle attacker
who has write-access to an error-tolerant FTP server presenting a certificate
compatible with a target web server under attack. Although the FTP server can
in theory protect against this particular attack by detecting HTTP POST requests
and/or terminating the connection after a small number of errors, this attack
variant shows that this is not a bug in the browser, the web server, or the
application server, but an emergent property of the TLS landscape.

### Is this a new attack?

The ALPACA attack is not fundamentally new. Cross-protocol
attacks on HTTP were first described by Jochen Topf (2001),
and Jann Horn presented the first attack on a TLS-secured HTTP
connection in 2014 involving ProFTPD. We did the first systematic
study for cross-protocol attacks against the browser exploiting
popular SMTP, IMAP, POP3, and FTP servers, performed an
internet-wide scan to estimate the number of affected web
servers, and generalized the attack away from a browser-specific
issue to a general property of misconfigured TLS servers. We
think that this new perspective is useful in focussing countermeasures
on a limited number of effective options, rather than patching
application servers one at a time as more exploits are found.

### Why does TLS not protect the TCP connection endpoints?

The ALPACA attack is only possible because TLS does not protect the source
or destination IP and port address of the TCP connection. As is stated
in the TLS RFC, TLS is application layer independent. However, this gap
in protection gives the attacker the flexibility to redirect traffic
from one server to another. If the presented certificate of the
substitute server is compatible with that of the intended server,
the general content confusion attack is possible (although it
depends on the server and client behavior if it can actually
be exploited).

### Can TLS mitigate these attacks at all?

Two extensions in TLS can provide some protection to the application layer
protocol: SNI and ALPN. With SNI, the client can let the server know about
the hostname it wants to connect to, which is useful in virtual hosting
configurations. Sadly, SNI is often misconfigured with an insecure fallback
to a default server, allowing content confusion attacks (for HTTP, these
were analyzed by Delignat et al. in 2015, and Zhang et al. in 2020).
However, the SNI standard allows the server to terminate the connection
if the hostname does not match the expected hostname of the server,
which would prevent some ALPACA attacks in practice. Unfortunately,
this strict behavior is rarely implemented, even among web servers.

For application servers, which commonly lag behind web servers in
feature completeness with regards to TLS, the situation is even more
dire. With ALPN, the client can let the server know about the intended
protocol, which is used to demultiplex between HTTP/1.x and HTTP/2
connections to a web server without requiring an additional roundtrip.
Here the standard mandates strict behavior, so a server supporting ALPN
should terminate the connection if no supported protocol is requested
by the client. Unfortunately, this strict behavior is commonly not
implemented, and many application servers do not even support the ALPN extension
at all.

### Why is the attack called "ALPACA"?

We initially were interested in special properties of the
HTTP, FTP and email protocols that make cross-protocols
practical. However, we eventually realized that the ALPACA
attack is generic, and that the authenticity of the TLS
connection is already compromised before any application
layer data is exchanged. So, the original acronym
("Application Layer Protocols Allowing Cross-Protocol Attacks")
was not a good fit anymore, because it is not the ALP allowing
the attack, but the insufficiency of TLS to protect the TCP
connection endpoints. Still, the name stuck, and we managed
to squeeze the letters in the title in the following way:
"Application Layer Protocol Confusion - Analyzing and mitigating
Cracks in tls Authentication". Tortured, we know.
But ALPACAs are still cute. :)

### How have vendors responded to this vulnerability?

Many vendors have updated their application servers to remove exploitation
vectors or add countermeasures in the application layer and/or TLS implementation.
TLS library maintainers have reviewed the ALPN and SNI implementations and
updated their code and documentation to allow easy implementation of
countermeasures by developers. To prevent the attacks in the pure browser
attacker model, browser vendors have blocked more standard application ports
and disabled content-sniffing in more scenarios.

Specific responses are listed below (please contact us if you have more info!):

* Microsoft Internet Explorer blocked more non-HTTP server ports and disabled content sniffing for HTTP requests
  to non-standard ports ([CVE-2021-31971](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-31971)).
* Sendmail fixed a bug to detect HTTP requests when STARTTLS is used, and since Sendmail 8.17 there are additional
  countermeasures at the application layer to block HTTP requests.
* Courier 5.1.0 implemented support for ALPN.
* FileZilla implemented countermeasures at the application and TLS layer.
* Vsftpd 3.0.4 implemented countermeasures at the application and TLS layer.
* Nginx 1.21.0 implemented mitigations at the application layer in the mail proxy.
* crypto/tls (Go) now [enforces ALPN overlap](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/90d6bbbe42c15d444c1da0a1c293192d6f735a8e)
  when negotiated on both sides.

### How is this attack related to other TLS attacks?

ALPACA uses the same attacker scenario as other TLS attacks,
i.e. it assumes a Man-in-the-Middle attacker who can lure a
victim to an attacker-controlled web site. However, in the
ALPACA attack, we do not try to attack the cryptographic
protections of TLS directly. Instead, we exploit defects
in the configuration of TLS services, who often share
certificates to save costs, reduce administrative work,
or enable reverse proxy deployments where several services
share a single, terminating TCP endpoint. In contrast to other
TLS attacks, the attacker never compromises the confidentiality
of the TLS connection. However, due to misconfiguration,
authenticity and integrity are affected, allowing the attacker
to inject some dangerous data into the connection, while
the victim remains oblivious to the attack.

### What about other protocols?

The ALPACA attack is generic, i.e. it describes the preconditions
under which TLS traffic from the client to one server implementing
one protocol can be redirected to another server implementing a
different protocol, which can lead to any number of undesirable
behavior or security vulnerabilities. We only looked at the
combination of a HTTP client with an SMTP, IMAP, POP3, or FTP
application server. We did not investigate any of the other
hundreds of possible cross-protocol scenarios possible with
current TLS enabled applications and servers. In addition,
as TLS is more widely deployed, more protocols will be added
to the TLS landscape, increasing the possibility of ALPACA
attacks quadratically with the number of protocols and applications.

If you find application layer protocol confusion attacks in other protocols,
let us know! We are of course very interested in hearing about other
affected protocols and applications.

### If my clients and servers verify the ALPN and SNI parameters of the TLS handshake, will I be secure against this attack?

We do not think that it is feasible for clients or servers to enforce
the use of ALPN and SNI for a long time, because doing so will exclude
legacy clients and servers that have not been updated yet, and it is
unlikely that this will be accepted by users or service providers.
However, if both client and server support ALPN, and make sure that
an acceptable protocol and hostname is negotiated, they will protect
connections to all other servers with compatible certificates by
the same client from almost all content confusion attacks.

However, there still is some room for content confusion attacks
even with ALPN and SNI fully deployed. If two services implement
the same protocol on the same host, but on a different port,
connections to one server can be redirected to another by an attacker.
This can enable same-protocol, same-host context confusion attacks
similar to those described by Delignat et al. (2015) and Zhang et al. (2020)
in very specific scenarios.

### Is this vulnerability really serious enough to deserve a name, a logo and a web page?

ALPACA is not a simple software bug that can be fixed with an update
to a single library or component. Instead, clients and servers need
to be updated to protect the connections to other (seemingly unrelated)
servers. This means we need to raise awareness of the issue across all
TLS-enabled applications and protocols, which is a huge effort. We expect
that the general ALPACA attack will stay with us for many years, so we
have a cute animal to keep us company while we help clients and servers
to adopt the suggested countermeasures!

Package        : nginx
Version        : 1.14.2-2+deb10u5
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-3618 CVE-2022-41741 CVE-2022-41742
Debian Bug     : 991328

It was discovered that parsing errors in the mp4 module of Nginx, a
high-performance web and reverse proxy server, could result in denial
of service, memory disclosure or potentially the execution of arbitrary
code when processing a malformed mp4 file.

This module is only enabled in the nginx-extras binary package.

In addition the following vulnerability has been fixed.

CVE-2021-3618

    ALPACA is an application layer protocol content confusion attack,
    exploiting TLS servers implementing different protocols but using
    compatible certificates, such as multi-domain or wildcard certificates.
    A MiTM attacker having access to victim's traffic at the TCP/IP layer can
    redirect traffic from one subdomain to another, resulting in a valid TLS
    session. This breaks the authentication of TLS and cross-protocol attacks
    may be possible where the behavior of one protocol service may compromise

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1.14.2-2+deb10u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your nginx packages.

For the detailed security status of nginx please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/nginx>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
