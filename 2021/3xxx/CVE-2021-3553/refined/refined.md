- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the EPPUpdateService of Bitdefender Endpoint Security Tools. This allows an attacker to use the Endpoint Protection relay as a proxy for any remote host.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially use the vulnerable endpoint protection relay as a proxy for any remote host, potentially gaining access to internal network resources or performing other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending crafted requests to the EPPUpdateService.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the EPPUpdateService of a vulnerable Bitdefender Endpoint Security Tools installation. User interaction is required. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
