{
  "CVE-2021-3695": {
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in the handling of crafted PNG grayscale images.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer underflow vulnerability in grub2 leads to out-of-bounds write in the heap."
    ],
    "Impact": "Out-of-bounds write to heap memory, potentially leading to memory corruption, arbitrary code execution, and circumvention of secure boot mechanism.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted 16-bit grayscale PNG image during the boot process.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs the ability to control the boot process and introduce a malicious PNG image before GRUB starts executing. It can be achieved by manipulating the boot media. Requires local access to the system."
