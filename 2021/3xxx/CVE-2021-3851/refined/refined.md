The provided content relates to a commit that fixes an unsecure redirect in the Firefly III project. The commit addresses an open redirect vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application was not properly validating redirect URLs, allowing an attacker to potentially redirect users to malicious websites after successful or unsuccessful actions (e.g., login, invalid form submission). The application used `url()->previous()` and `redirectTo` from the exception without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Open redirect:**  The application was vulnerable to open redirects through the `previousUrl` and the `redirectTo` parameter in Laravel validation exceptions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could craft malicious URLs that, when clicked by a user or when a form submission fails, would redirect them to an attacker-controlled site, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other malicious activity.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could craft a malicious URL in the `previous` parameter or a malicious url in the `redirectTo` property of the Laravel Validation Exception. When a user clicks on this link, or submits a form, they will be redirected to the malicious URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing a malicious URL in the `previous` or `redirectTo` query parameters, and needs to convince a victim to either click it, or fail a form submission where the exception contains the malicious URL.
