## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 35 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [RPM-4.17](/wiki/Changes/RPM-4.17 "Changes/RPM-4.17")
* [IBus 1.5.25](/wiki/Changes/IBus_1.5.25 "Changes/IBus 1.5.25")
* [F35MingwEnvToolchainUpdate](/wiki/Changes/F35MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/F35MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")
* [golang1.17](/wiki/Changes/golang1.17 "Changes/golang1.17")
* [LLVM-13](/wiki/Changes/LLVM-13 "Changes/LLVM-13")

## Before the rebuild

```
- exclude GHC from the mass rebuild by updating the scripts before run.
- use rpmdevtools 9.5 for rpmautospec support

```

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, July 21st. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f35
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However, maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f35. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f35 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f35
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2020-07-21 10:00:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| Just woke up and fixed the bug in git. thanks for reporting! The issue have nothing to do with ELF, binaries starting with "LE" are "LE" executables. Hello,  [@trufae](https://github.com/trufae) Could you please clarify - does this project consider this a security vulnerability? Is there a potential security boundary crossed here? It's not obvious as I would not typically consider r2 as "service" for "denial-of-service" but a local command line utility used by software engineers/security researchers, generally.  Note: In trying to determine this, I also checked <https://github.com/radareorg/radare2/security/policy> but it does not explicitly specify which types of issues are considered security vulnerabilities. |

| It's not really a DoS, because the loop is just large, not infinite, but this can take a very long time to finish, so let's consider it a DoS, users can ^C but setting up in a webservice or in batch can become an SLA problem.  I don't have a strong opinion on that, and i know DoS is considered a security vuln in many other environments, so let's say it is a security vuln, despite it doesnt allow to damage, take control or abuse the system running it.  There's no potential security issue beyond the high CPU usage for a large portion of time. |
