### @stefanberger **[stefanberger](/stefanberger)** commented [Jun 21, 2021](#issue-926521103)

Reset buffer size indicators that are found to be too large so that we don't have bad buffer sizes in memory that can cause issues when marshaling the data upon saving volatile data for example.

Check for the maximum size of a buffer when marshaling data so we do not overstep the TPM2B's buffer size.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Reset the buffer size indicator in a TPM2B type of buffer after it failed
the test for the maximum buffer size it allows. This prevents having bad
buffer sizes in memory that can come to haunt us when writing the volatile
state for example.

| Isn't there anything better than `assert()` that could be done? If it can be triggered from the guest, it may still be exploitable to break the VM in some ways. |

tpm2: Restore original value if unmarsalled value was illegal

Restore the original value of the memory location where data from
a stream was unmarshalled and the unmarshalled value was found to
be illegal. The goal is to not keep illegal values in memory.

tpm2: Reset TPM2B buffer sizes after test fails for valid buffer size

```
Reset the buffer size indicator in a TPM2B type of buffer after it failed
the test for the maximum buffer size it allows. This prevents having bad
buffer sizes in memory that can come to haunt us when writing the volatile
state for example.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1976806#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-06-28 10:05:32 UTC  ``` A bug was discovered in the libtpms code that may cause access to a buffer beyond the boundary of the buffer or cause failures when trying to resume the state of the vTPM. The vulnerability can be triggered by specially-crafted TPM 2 command packets containing unacceptable/illegal values and those values become an issue when the volatile state of the TPM 2 is marshalled/written or unmarshalled/read. In the former case this can lead to a buffer access beyond its boundary and in the latter case to refusal to accept the state blob due to an illegal value.  To the best of our knowledge, the buffer access beyond its boundaries case does NOT lead to code execution, and as such, any exploitation is likely limited to information leakage and / or denial-of-service (DoS), i.e. a crash. Further, an attacker must have (indirect or direct) access to call TPMLIB_VolatileAll_Store to exploit this flaw.  Upstream PR: <https://github.com/stefanberger/libtpms/pull/223>  Upstream fix: <https://github.com/stefanberger/libtpms/commit/2f30d62> <https://github.com/stefanberger/libtpms/commit/7981d9a> <https://github.com/stefanberger/libtpms/commit/2e6173c>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1976806#c2)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-06-28 10:16:26 UTC  ``` Created libtpms tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1976811](show_bug.cgi?id=1976811 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2021-3623 libtpms: out-of-bounds access when trying to resume the state of the vTPM [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1976806#c6)  Stefan Berger    2021-10-14 21:17:18 UTC  ``` This bug has been fixed a while ago.
