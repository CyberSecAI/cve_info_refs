Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3623:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of buffer sizes within the `libtpms` library when processing TPM 2 command packets. Specifically, the library didn't adequately validate the size of data being marshaled (written) or unmarshaled (read) to/from buffers, leading to potential out-of-bounds access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read/write:** When processing TPM2 commands, the `libtpms` library could attempt to access memory outside the allocated buffer due to incorrect size indicators, potentially leading to a crash or information disclosure.
- **Lack of size validation:**  The library was missing checks to ensure that the size of the data being marshaled/unmarshaled did not exceed the maximum buffer size, and that the unmarshalled values were valid.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a potential crash due to out-of-bounds memory access when processing crafted TPM commands or during volatile state save/restore operations. This leads to denial of service by disrupting the normal functionality of the affected virtual TPM.
- **Information Leakage (possible, but not confirmed):** It was mentioned that the out-of-bounds read could lead to information leakage, but it is not confirmed that this is exploitable in practice.
- **VM instability:** Due to the potential for a crash of the virtual TPM, the host VM may also experience instability, even though it is not directly exploited.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Specially-crafted TPM 2 command packets:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending TPM 2 commands with malformed or illegal size values to the virtual TPM. This can be done by manipulating the data within the TPM command stream.
- **Manipulated volatile state:** The vulnerability could be triggered when attempting to restore a virtual TPM state that has been tampered with, i.e., the state blob being unmarshalled contains illegal size values.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to the virtual TPM interface:** The attacker needs the capability to send commands to, or manipulate the state of, the virtual TPM. This could be achieved through:
    - Direct access to the VM if the attacker has compromised the VM.
    - Indirect access by manipulating the hypervisor or other management layer if the attacker can control a privileged context.
- **Ability to create or manipulate TPM command data:** The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted TPM commands, or alter a volatile state blob, that include malformed size values to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the marshalling (writing) and unmarshalling (reading) of TPM state data, specifically the `TPM2B` data structures.
- The fix includes adding size checks in the `TPM2B_Marshal` function and resetting buffer size indicators when invalid sizes are detected during unmarshalling.
- The fix also includes restoring the original value of a memory location if the unmarshalled value was determined to be illegal, preventing the storage of corrupted values.
- The vulnerability was addressed in `libtpms` versions 0.6.5, 0.7.8, and 0.8.4.
