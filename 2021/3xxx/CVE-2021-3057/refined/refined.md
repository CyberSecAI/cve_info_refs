- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A man-in-the-middle attacker can disrupt system processes and potentially execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. This could lead to a complete compromise of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: A network-based man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to perform a man-in-the-middle attack on a network connection where the GlobalProtect app is connecting to a portal or gateway.
