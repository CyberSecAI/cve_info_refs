### ASUSWRT

## THE POWERFUL USER-FRIENDLY INTERFACE

The enhanced ASUSWRT graphical user interface gives you easy access to the 30-second, 3-step web-based installation process. It's also where you can configure AiCloud 2.0 and all advanced options. ASUSWRT is web-based, so it doesn't need a separate app, or restrict what you can change via mobile devices — you get full access to everything, from any device that can run a web browser.

![]()

ASUSWRT feature availability varies according to router model. [Check here.](https://www.asus.com/websites/global/productcustomizedTab/562/ASUSWRT%20portal%20feature.pdf)

### Traffic Analyzer

## The easy way to spot internet bottlenecks

Traffic Analyzer gives you an at-a-glance view of what's happening on your network on a daily, weekly or monthly timescale. It lets you see immediately how much bandwidth each user, device or application has used, helping you to reduce bottlenecks in your internet connection. It's also great for parents who want to keep an eye on their children's internet usage, or for small businesses who need to monitor employees' internet activity.

## AiProtection

#### Your advanced security gateway

AiProtection, incorporating state-of-the-art, three-pronged security from Trend Micro™, gives you enterprise-level security in the home — making ASUS routers equipped with this feature the most secure home routers you can buy! It constantly monitors the health and safety of your network for total peace of mind.

![]()

## Router security scan

#### Checks 14 critical security configurations, discovers risks affecting your router and recommends ways of improving protection.

#### Without AiProtection

Many simple problems can compromise security, such as a weak router password, unencrypted Wi-Fi or unblocked remote access. Incorrect settings could allow hackers to change router settings and bypass your firewall to control devices, steal sensitive personal information or even use your IP camera remotely.

Your device

#### With AiProtection

Once all the basic security settings are checked and enabled, your router and all the devices connected to your home network will be safe and secure from outside interference. You'll have the peace of mind of knowing that hackers will be kept at bay, and that your data and privacy are well-protected.
