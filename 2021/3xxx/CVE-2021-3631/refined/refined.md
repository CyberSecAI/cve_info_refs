{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "An issue in libvirt's SELinux MCS category generation logic where the program could generate a single category context instead of a dual category context if two randomly generated numbers were equal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure generation of SELinux MCS category pairs",
      "Improper generation of random numbers leading to single category context creation"
    ],
    "impact": "An exploited guest can access files labeled for another guest by having the same single category context, resulting in the breaking out of sVirt confinement and allowing unauthorized access to another guest's files.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting a vulnerability within a virtual guest to gain control and then using the improper labels to access files belonging to other guests."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a guest with a valid category pair where one of the categories matches the single category context of another guest that is being targeted. The exploited guest also needs to have an exploit in QEMU before this vulnerability can be used."
