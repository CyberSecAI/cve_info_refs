# CVE: CVE-2021-3394

Millennium Millewin also known as "Cartella clinica"

Vendor: Millennium S.r.l. / Dedalus Group / Dedalus Italia S.p.a.

Affected version: 13.39.028
                  13.39.28.3342
                  13.39.146.1
                  -

Summary (from online translator):
Millewin represents the Professional Solution par excellence, recognized and supported by over 18,000 doctors. Millewin is able to guarantee ideal management
of the patient's medical records, it also adheres perfectly to the most recent requirements of the General Practitioner and, thanks to the latest functional
innovations, it assists the doctor in the diagnosis and management of therapy. It can be used, at no additional cost, for group medicine and at the secretarial
station. Millewin is integrated with all Regional and Corporate Projects. Millewin modules: ACN, MilleDSS, MilleAIR, Redazione e invio fatture, MilleBook.

Vuln desc:
The application is prone to insecure permissions in its folders that allows unprivileged user complete control. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by
arbitrarily replacing file(s) invoked by service(s)/startup regkey impacted. File(s) will be executed with SYSTEM privileges.

The application is subject to insecure folders permissions issue impacting the services 'MillewinTaskService' and 'PDS Server' for Windows deployed as part of
Millewin suite (Cartella clinica) software application, and the registy runkey responsible to start update (MilleUpdater) task.
This allow an authorized but non-privileged local or remote user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system. An attacker can easily take
advantage of the flaw arbitrarily replacing the impacted file(s) that will be executed during application startup or reboot. If successful, the malicious file(s)
would execute with the elevated privileges of the application.

The application also suffers from unquoted service path issues.

(1) Impacted executable on startup by regkey.
Any low privileged user can elevate their privileges abusing this scenario:

Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
Value name:	MilleLiveUpdate
Value data:	"C:\Program Files (x86)\Millewin\MilleUpdater\MilleUpdater.exe"

(2) Impacted services.
Any low privileged user can elevate their privileges abusing any of these (also unquoted) services:

Millewin, operazioni pianificate    MillewinTaskService         C:\Program Files (x86)\Millewin\GestioneTaskService.exe     Auto
PDS Server                          PDS Server                  C:\Program Files (x86)\Millewin\WatchDogService.exe         Auto

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
