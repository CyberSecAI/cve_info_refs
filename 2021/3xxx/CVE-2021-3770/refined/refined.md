Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-3770:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `ex_retab()` function of Vim. This function is used when the `:retab` command is executed, specifically when processing a large value for the tab stop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow: This occurs when data is written beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.
- Improper input validation: The `tabstop_set` function, used by `ex_retab` when setting the tab stops, doesn't properly check for excessively large, or negative values being passed in.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The buffer overflow can cause a crash, leading to a denial of service.
- Sensitive information disclosure, data modification, and potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted file: A specially crafted text file containing a large value in the `retab` command can trigger the overflow.
- Command injection:  A user might intentionally or unintentionally supply a malformed `:retab` command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker must be able to provide a crafted text file to a vulnerable version of Vim, or cause a vulnerable version of Vim to execute a crafted `:retab` command.

**Additional details from the content:**

- **Gentoo Security Advisory:** The Gentoo advisory indicates that the vulnerability affects `app-editors/gvim` and `app-editors/vim` versions prior to 9.0.0060, and also `app-editors/vim-core`. It mentions that this is one of multiple vulnerabilities discovered and provides an upgrade command using their package manager (`emerge`).
- **Openwall mailing list:**  The Openwall discussion provides more details about the exploitation of the vulnerability, including the specific command needed to trigger the overflow, which involves providing a large value for the `:retab` setting. The mailing list message also highlights the heap-based buffer overflow and that the issue is triggered by an invalid memory access. The message also specifies that building vim with specific flags: `--with-features=huge --enable-gui=none` and running with an address sanitizer will reproduce the issue.
- **GitHub commit:** The commit log message for the fix states, "Invalid memory access when using :retab with large value. Check the number is positive."  The code changes in the provided diffs show that a check is added in the `tabstop_set` function to ensure that the value is positive and not too large (less than 9999), before being used. The fix also changes the return value of the `tabstop_set` function on failure to `FAIL` instead of `FALSE`.
- **NetApp Advisory:** NetApp has issued an advisory that highlights that multiple of its products incoroprating vim are vulnerable. The advisory notes that exploitation can lead to sensitive information disclosure, data modification, or DoS and lists the impacted versions of ONTAP Select Deploy administration utility and their fix. It also lists numerous products that are not affected by this vulnerability. The CVSS score is 7.8 (High).
- **Fedora package update:** The Fedora update message indicates the fix, stating "Security fix for CVE-2021-3770" and providing the specific version `vim-8.2.3404-1.fc33` as the fix for this CVE.
- **Red Hat Bugzilla entry:** The Bugzilla entry confirms the vulnerability and mentions a heap-based buffer overflow when using `:retab` with a large value. It also indicates the resolution version is vim 8.2.3403 and the type of document the resolution should be captured in, should it be needed. It also notes that this has been marked as "CLOSED NOTABUG".
- **Other security reports:** Some vulnerability reports indicate that the issue exists when vim is compiled with `--with-features=huge`

In summary, this content provides comprehensive information about a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Vim's `ex_retab()` function, which can lead to DoS and potentially other security issues. Various sources confirm the vulnerability, its cause, its impact, and the fix that was applied.
