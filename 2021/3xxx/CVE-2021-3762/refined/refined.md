    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how Claircore extracts RPM packages from a tar archive. A malicious tar archive with a member containing multiple 'parent' directory elements (e.g., ../../../) could cause a file outside the intended target directory to be overwritten.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Path traversal vulnerability when extracting tar archives.",
        "Improper sanitization of file paths in tar archive members."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could craft a malicious container image layer with a specially crafted RPM archive that, when scanned by Clair, would overwrite arbitrary files on the filesystem. This can lead to remote code execution (RCE) on the Clair scanner instance.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted container image layer with a malicious RPM archive.",
        "Specifically crafted tar archive with manipulated file paths."
