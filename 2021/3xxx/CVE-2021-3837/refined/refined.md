Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerabilities addressed in the commit:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the insufficient validation of redirect URLs within the Openwhyd application, specifically during the login process. The application was vulnerable to open redirect attacks, where a malicious user could craft a login request with a redirect parameter pointing to an arbitrary external domain or a `javascript:` URL, potentially leading to phishing or XSS attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Open Redirect:** The application did not properly sanitize or validate the `redirect` parameter during login, allowing attackers to redirect users to malicious websites after successful login.
2.  **Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via Redirect:** The application was also vulnerable to XSS attacks by injecting `javascript:` URLs or `<script>` tags in the redirect parameter, allowing for arbitrary JavaScript execution in the user's browser.
3.  **Improper Authorization:** Although not directly detailed in this snippet, the commit message references an "Improper Authorization vulnerability" fixed by the changes. This likely relates to how redirects were handled post-authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing:** Attackers could redirect users to fake login pages after they attempted to log in to the genuine Openwhyd application, stealing their credentials.
*   **XSS:** Execution of arbitrary javascript code within the user's browser session.
*   **Compromised user accounts:** Successful exploitation could lead to account hijacking or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A malicious user would craft a special URL or form submission to the `/login` endpoint, including a `redirect` parameter containing a malicious URL, javascript code or script tags.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with a crafted `redirect` parameter.
*   The attacker needs to get a user to click the malicious link.

**Additional details:**

The provided diff shows the following changes that address these issues:

*   **`app/controllers/api/login.js`:**
    *   The code now validates the `redirect` parameter using `snip.getSafeOpenwhydURL` function.
    *   If `snip.getSafeOpenwhydURL` returns `false`, an "Unsafe redirect target" error is raised.
*   **`app/models/logging.js`**:
    *   Introduces `safeRedirect` method that makes use of `snip.getSafeOpenwhydURL` to validate the URL, and prevents redirect if the URL is considered unsafe.
*   **`app/snip.js`:**
    *   Introduces `getSafeOpenwhydURL` function to check if a given url is a safe Openwhyd URL based on comparing protocol and host and rejecting javascript and `<script>` tags within the `url`.
*   **`test/api/security.api.tests.js`:**
    *   Adds tests to ensure the `/login` endpoint prevents redirects to other domains, javascript urls or urls containing script tags.
    *   Adds tests to ensure a safe redirect is correctly handled.

The commit aims to prevent open redirect and XSS vulnerabilities by implementing proper URL validation and sanitization when handling user-provided redirects.
