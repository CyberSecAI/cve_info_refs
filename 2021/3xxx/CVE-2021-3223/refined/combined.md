### **[ghost](/ghost)** commented [Jan 11, 2021](#issue-783057647)

| In /nodes/ui\_base.js, the URL is matched with'/ui\_base/js/\*' and then passed to path.join,  The lack of verification of the final path leads to a path traversal vulnerability.  We can use this vulnerability to read sensitive data on the server, such as settings.js. What are the steps to reproduce?  1. Install node-red-dashboard on node-red server 2. curl "ip:port/ui\_base/js/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd"  What happens? The server returns the passwd file content What do you expect to happen? 404 Please tell us about your environment:  * Node-RED-Dashboard version: 2.23.0 * Node-RED version: v1.1.2 * node.js version: v10.21.0 * npm version: 6.14.4 * Platform/OS: linux * Browser: None |
