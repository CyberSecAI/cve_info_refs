Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-3223:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization when handling URLs in `/nodes/ui_base.js`. Specifically, the URL is matched with `/ui_base/js/*`, and then the matched part is passed to `path.join` without prior verification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue. By crafting a malicious URL containing sequences like `..%2f`, an attacker can navigate outside the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access sensitive files on the server, such as `settings.js` or the `/etc/passwd` file, potentially exposing configuration details or user information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP requests. Specifically, crafting malicious URLs that include path traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server. No specific position or privilege is required, making it remotely exploitable.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was reported and fixed in version 2.26.2 of `node-red-dashboard`.
- The fix involved checking the served endpoint to prevent path traversal.
- The specific vulnerable file is `/nodes/ui_base.js`.
- The issue was discovered by "ghost" on January 11, 2021.
- The vulnerability is triggered due to the use of `path.join` without proper sanitization of the input.
