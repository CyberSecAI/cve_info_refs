### **[robert-scheck](/robert-scheck)** commented [Jan 25, 2021](#issue-793779879)

| As of writing, Wekan disables the SSL/TLS certificate validation for LDAP by default [unless `LDAP_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=true`](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/master/packages/wekan-ldap/server/ldap.js#L22) is explicitly set. Thus, by default, Wekan is effectively vulnerable to MITM attacks, even when using SSL/TLS for LDAP. I treat this default behaviour as bad, given that security shouldn't be opt-in but opt-out (e.g. for test-only environments). As this behaviour does not seem to be properly documented for system administrators (at least not outside of the source code), I would treat this as a vulnerability following [CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html) and thus as a CVE-worthy candidate.  Oh, and please note that Node.js itself has, according to its [documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/tls.html), a security-wise default by having `true` as default for `rejectUnauthorized`. |
