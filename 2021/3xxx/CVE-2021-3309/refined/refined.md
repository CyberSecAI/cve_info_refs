Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3309:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper default configuration of Wekan's LDAP integration. Specifically, SSL/TLS certificate validation for LDAP connections was disabled by default. This means that Wekan would connect to an LDAP server without verifying the server's identity, making it vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. The vulnerability is due to the default setting of  `rejectUnauthorized` being set to `false` instead of `true`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation**: The core issue is that Wekan did not enforce proper certificate validation by default when connecting to LDAP servers using SSL/TLS.
- **MITM Vulnerability**: By disabling certificate validation, an attacker could intercept and potentially modify communications between Wekan and the LDAP server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Confidentiality Breach**: An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information exchanged between Wekan and the LDAP server, such as usernames, passwords, and other user data.
- **Data Integrity Breach**: An attacker could potentially modify data during the connection, leading to unexpected or malicious changes to Wekan configurations or user profiles.
- **Authentication Bypass**: An attacker could potentially impersonate the LDAP server, allowing unauthorized access to Wekan.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network-based**: The attack would likely occur over a network where an attacker can intercept communications between Wekan and the LDAP server. This could be on the same local network as the server, or an attacker could compromise network infrastructure and act as a relay.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle Position**: An attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between Wekan and the LDAP server. This could be through network access or by compromising network infrastructure.
- **Network Knowledge**: Attacker should have some understanding of network traffic and how SSL/TLS connections are established to perform the interception effectively.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was identified and reported by `robert-scheck`.
- The fix involved changing the default value of `rejectUnauthorized` to `true` in the `packages/wekan-ldap/server/ldap.js` file, which ensures that certificate validation is enabled by default.
- The fix was implemented in pull request #3483 and included in the v4.87 release.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2021-3309 after the fix was implemented.
