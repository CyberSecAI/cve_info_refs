  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-3779",
    "description": "A malicious MySQL server can request local file content from a client using ruby-mysql prior to version 2.10.0 without explicit authorization from the user. This issue was resolved in version 2.10.0 and later.",
    "affected_component": "ruby-mysql Ruby gem",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the ruby-mysql gem's behavior when handling 'LOAD DATA LOCAL' statements from a MySQL server, where it doesn't provide an option to disable this feature, which allows a malicious server to request local file content from a client.",
    "vulnerability_details": [
      "The ruby-mysql gem, prior to version 2.10.0, is vulnerable to CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere. ",
      "A malicious MySQL server can send a LOAD DATA LOCAL statement to the client, instructing it to provide data from a local file readable by the client.",
       "The client does not provide an option to disable LOAD DATA LOCAL queries.",
      "This is not a MySQL server/protocol issue but a client vulnerability."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious actor can read arbitrary files from a client that uses ruby-mysql to communicate with a rogue MySQL server. This impacts confidentiality, allowing attackers to gain access to sensitive data on the client system.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is network-based. A rogue MySQL server sends a 'LOAD DATA LOCAL' command to a vulnerable client.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a MySQL server and have a client connect to it using the vulnerable ruby-mysql gem.",
    "remediation": "Users should update to version 2.10.0 or later of the ruby-mysql gem. Alternatively, users can patch the issue by disallowing the CLIENT_LOCAL_FILES option."
