{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The GRUB2 upstream version reintroduced a vulnerability (CVE-2020-15705) related to signature validation bypass.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "When certificates that signed GRUB are installed into the db, GRUB can be booted directly, bypassing signature validation for the kernel.",
      "The booted kernel incorrectly believes it was booted in secure boot mode, implementing lockdown despite not having been properly validated."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can boot a tampered kernel without signature validation. The tampered kernel, while believing it was booted in Secure Boot mode, implements lockdown. This could lead to arbitrary code execution and system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": "Direct boot of a tampered GRUB with installed signing certificates in db.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to boot the system with a modified GRUB and have signing certificates for the modified GRUB to be present in the system's db."
