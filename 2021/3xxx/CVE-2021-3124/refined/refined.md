- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "Custom Global Variables" version 1.0.5 does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the "name" field, before storing it in the database. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. This code will then be executed in the browsers of other users who access the plugin's settings or other areas where this data is displayed, potentially leading to account compromise, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request to the plugin's settings page, injecting the JavaScript payload into the "name" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access and modify the plugin's settings. This typically requires at least an administrator-level user role in the WordPress instance.
