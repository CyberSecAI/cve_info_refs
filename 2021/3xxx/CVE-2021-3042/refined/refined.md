- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper control of user-controlled file leads to local privilege escalation. The vulnerability is due to the Cortex XDR agent not properly handling user-controlled files, specifically related to file creation in the Windows root directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427). Specifically, the agent is vulnerable to a local privilege escalation because an attacker can create files in the Windows root directory, and the agent does not handle this situation securely.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a local authenticated Windows user to execute programs with SYSTEM privileges. This could lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, data manipulation, and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have a local account on the affected Windows system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be a local authenticated user on the Windows system and have the ability to create files in the Windows root directory (such as C:\).
