Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-3589:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an authorization flaw within the `foreman_ansible` component. Specifically, it is related to the introduction of REX and job templates in version `2.0.0` and later of `foreman_ansible`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** Authenticated users with specific permissions to create and run Ansible jobs can potentially gain unauthorized access to hosts through the job templates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** The vulnerability could lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.
*   **Integrity Compromise:** Attackers might be able to modify system data, leading to data integrity issues.
*  **System Availability:** The vulnerability could affect the normal operation and availability of the system.
* **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can achieve remote code execution on target machines.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Job Templates:** The attack vector involves exploiting job templates within the `foreman_ansible` component.
*   **Ansible Functions:** Attackers can leverage Ansible functions to execute actions with the privileges of the Foreman-proxy user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user in Foreman.
*   **Privileged Access:** The attacker needs to have permissions to create or modify job templates, which is considered administrative-equivalent privilege. (PR:H)
*   **Access to Foreman Hosts:** The attacker needs access to at least one Foreman-managed host and knowledge about at least one other host to gain access to the second machine. (AC:H)
*   **Knowledge of Foreman setup:** The attacker needs to be aware of how hosts are added to Foreman.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced with the addition of REX and job templates in `foreman_ansible` version `2.0.0` onwards.
* The vulnerability is considered of "medium" severity.
*   The attacker needs to have a high level of privilege within the Foreman system (PR:H).
*   The attacker needs to deploy at least two hosts managed by Foreman to be able to execute code on a target. (AC:H)
* The attacker leverages one host to reach another.
