The provided content relates to a commit in the `showdoc` repository on GitHub. The commit modifies the `UserController.class.php` file, specifically how the `cookie_token` is handled, adding a check for PHP version.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability**: The commit addresses a potential issue with how cookies are set, particularly the `samesite` attribute, which is not supported in PHP versions prior to 7.3.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Without the commit, the application could potentially be vulnerable to issues related to cookie handling in older PHP versions. Specifically, the `samesite` attribute would be ignored, potentially impacting security if the application relied on this setting. This can expose the application to CSRF attacks as `samesite` helps mitigate these attacks.

**Impact of exploitation**:  If the `samesite` attribute is ignored (in PHP versions before 7.3.0), the potential impact could be:
*   CSRF vulnerabilities: If `samesite` is set to `Strict` it would block most cross-site requests. If it is not set and a user is logged in to the website, an attacker can make the browser perform unintended actions on the website using malicious code on another website the user visited.

**Attack vectors**: An attacker could leverage CSRF through malicious links on external sites to perform unauthorized actions in the targeted application

**Required attacker capabilities/position**:
*   The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to visit a malicious site or click on a link in an email or chat, which includes malicious code that crafts a request to the vulnerable application
*   The attacker does not require access to the server, but the user must have an active session
*   The application should be hosted on a PHP version prior to 7.3.0 to make the attack work (in the case the commit is not applied)

**Additional Notes:**
*   The commit introduces a PHP version check (`version_compare(PHP_VERSION,'7.3.0','>')`) to conditionally set the cookie with the `samesite` attribute if the PHP version is 7.3.0 or higher. This ensures that the application works correctly with different PHP versions.
*   The cookie's `httponly` attribute is set, which helps mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   The patch also sets the cookie `path` to `/` for php versions 7.3.0 and higher. This makes the cookie available in the entire domain.
*   The code is setting the cookie expiration to 180 days for PHP 7.3+ and 90 days for php versions under 7.3
