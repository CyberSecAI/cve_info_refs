Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3481:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The advisory RHSA-2021:4172 mentions `CVE-2021-3481` explicitly as a security fix: "qt: Out of bounds read in function QRadialFetchSimd from crafted svg file (CVE-2021-3481)".
   - The description of the bugzilla bug 1931444 is also related to "CVE-2021-3481 qt: Out of bounds read in function QRadialFetchSimd from crafted svg file"
   - This confirms that the content relates to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    - The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read that occurs within the `QRadialFetchSimd<QSimdSse2>::fetch` function.
    - The root cause is related to a crafted Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file.
    - It is also mentioned that invalid sign extension causes integer overflow which could be the root cause.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    - Out-of-bounds read due to incorrect handling of crafted SVG file.
    - Possible integer overflow due to invalid sign extension while parsing double values.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
    - Unauthorized memory access, potentially leading to data confidentiality loss.
    - Possible application crash/denial of service.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
    -  Crafted SVG files
   
**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - Ability to provide a crafted SVG file to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details (from content beyond the CVE description)**

*   **Specific Function:** The vulnerability lies within the `QRadialFetchSimd<QSimdSse2>::fetch` function, which is involved in rendering radial gradients within SVGs.
*   **Code Location:** The specific line of code causing the issue was identified as `qdrawhelper_p.h:601:13` and the crash was shown to occur in `qt_fetch_radial_gradient_sse2`, which are both related to rendering gradients
*   **Fix Details:** The fix includes clamping parsed double values to float-representable values. 
*   **Affected Versions:** The affected Qt versions include 5.15.1, 6.0.0, 6.0.2, 6.2, and earlier versions before 4.8.0 are not affected.
*   **Severity:** Red Hat classified this as having a "Moderate" security impact. Upstream Qt Project classified it as “P1: Critical”.
*   **CVSS Score:**  No specific CVSS score was given in the text, but this vulnerability is mentioned in the advisory alongside CVEs with CVSS scores.
*   **Fix Versions:** The fix was implemented in Qt versions 5.12.11, 5.15.4, 6.0.3, 6.1.0 RC and 6.2.0.
*   **Red Hat Fix:** This vulnerability was addressed in `RHSA-2021:4172` by updating the qt5 packages in RHEL.

**Summary of Extracted Information:**

- **Root cause:** Out-of-bounds read in the `QRadialFetchSimd<QSimdSse2>::fetch` function when processing crafted SVG files, likely due to integer overflow from invalid sign extension.
- **Weakness:** Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized memory access, potential data confidentiality loss, and possible application crash/denial of service.
- **Attack vector:** By providing a crafted SVG file to the vulnerable application
- **Attacker position:** Requires the attacker to provide a crafted SVG file, no special permissions are needed
- **Additional Information:** The issue is fixed by clamping parsed doubles to floats.
