| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c0)  Cedric Buissart    2021-07-09 09:25:56 UTC  ``` Cockpit (and its plugins) do not seem to protect itself against clickjacking : it is possible to render a page from a cockpit server via another website, inside an <iFrame> HTML entry.  This may be used by a malicious website in clickjacking, or similar, attacks.   To prevent this behavior, a X-Frame-Options header could be added to the responses.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c2)  Martin Pitt    2021-07-09 09:56:58 UTC  ``` You mean you can embed a Cockpit iframe into other web pages? That's actually explicitly documented/supported: <https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/embedding.html>  If I understand you correctly, you want to disable that (at least by default)? If embedding is not en vogue any more, we could default to "X-Frame-Options: sameorigin" [1] (which should at least retain the reverse-proxy case, like in Foreman/Satellite), and provide an option in cockpit.conf to open it up further?   [1] <https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c3)  Cedric Buissart    2021-07-09 11:45:05 UTC  ``` The behavior triggers warnings on Web testing tools (e.g.: Burp Suite).  The issue comes from the fact that a malicious site may target a user known to be logged in cockpit, by, for example, hiding a cockpit page in a transparent frame, which might be clicked on by the user.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c4)  Cedric Buissart    2021-07-20 08:29:43 UTC  ``` Hello Martin,  Yes, I think limiting the range of pages accessible via iFrames might be a good thing. At first sight, the attacks are very limited, since cockpit uses Web Sockets rather than GET/POST, but it might still be doable to do things like temporarily disable SELinux, since that button is accessible from a single click.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c5)  Martin Pitt    2021-07-22 04:38:03 UTC  ``` Cedric: We'll investigate this. However, this is already public in pretty much the widest possible way: It is documented upstream [1], as a corresponding upstream issue [2], and has existed for many years. Does it make sense to keep this embargoed? If not, can this become a normal public bug against cockpit in RHEL 8?  [1] <https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/embedding.html> [2] <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/issues/16122>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c6)  Cedric Buissart    2021-07-22 08:58:59 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c5): > Cedric: We'll investigate this. However, this is already public in pretty > much the widest possible way: It is documented upstream [1], as a > corresponding upstream issue [2], and has existed for many years. Does it > make sense to keep this embargoed?  No, indeed, it doesn't. I am making it public  > If not, can this become a normal public bug against cockpit in RHEL 8? However, I think this warrants a CVE, as other Web applications have been treated similarly (recent examples : Jenkins & Kibana). This bug will be the generic flaw bug, describing the vulnerability, and I will open a tracker bug dedicated to RHEL-8 separately.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c9)  Cedric Buissart    2021-07-22 12:57:02 UTC  ``` Created cockpit tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1984907](show_bug.cgi?id=1984907 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2021-3660 cockpit: pages vulnerable to clickjacking [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c13)  Sandro Bonazzola    2021-09-02 07:10:14 UTC  ``` Is this affecting also RHEL 7?   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c14)  Martin Pitt    2021-09-02 07:16:42 UTC  ``` Yes, the embedding feature has been in cockpit since pretty much day one.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c17)  Martin Pitt    2021-09-13 13:30:12 UTC  ``` @cbuissar I looked into this more deeply now in <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/16342> . I first created a test which ensures that same-origin frame embedding actually works outside of the cockpit web server [1]. That's the case which we care about, which we want to support (and I think there is no contention here). Before, we only tested frame embedding inside of a cockpit session [2], which is not a realistic use case.  As I mentioned above, I have a hard time to actually get a cross-origin cockpit frame to work. I tested this with Chromium 90.0.4430 and Firefox 92.0, with your reproducer and with our test setup, and due to the "SameSite: strict" cookie policy, cross-origin frames don't retain authentication and thus I keep getting the login page. I wrote another test case for this [4] which gets the same result (it also illustrates that and where it should really fail, with setting X-Frame-Options:).  I would really like to understand *if* and *how* you were able to do this (as you wrote a reproducer). Did you actually see the authenticated pages, or just the login page? If the former, what exact browser, OS, cockpit version did you use? Where did you run cockpit, same or different machine as your file:/// reproducer?  Thanks!  [1] <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/16342/commits/2a3b6854107ec7f1713a8da7eaeb7c666bf0ee0e> [2] <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/blob/main/test/verify/check-embed> [3] <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/commit/46f6839d1af4e662648a85f3e54bba2d57f39f0e> [4] <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/16342/commits/f49ad4874e1b936abfb60607df735698cb672ae4>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c18)  Martin Pitt    2021-09-14 07:40:01 UTC  ``` I now pushed the actual X-F-O bits/documentation/test to <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/16342> and added a release note/screenshot.  However, for evaluating the impact/backporting to stable releases etc., I'm still interested in whether this was really exploitable before, or you just saw the login page. Thanks!   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c23)  Sandro Bonazzola    2021-09-17 14:28:02 UTC  ``` (In reply to Martin Pitt from [comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c14)) > Yes, the embedding feature has been in cockpit since pretty much day one.  Shouldn't we have a tracker for RHEL 7 here as well then?   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c25)  Martin Pitt    2021-09-20 06:44:54 UTC  ``` Cedric: Ah-aa! thanks for the screenshot. Your target system was RHEL 8.3, I only tried with 8.4, 8.5, and Fedora. 8.3 still had a non-strict cookie policy, which got tightened in [bug 1891944](show_bug.cgi?id=1891944 "CLOSED ERRATA - cockpit SameSite cookie attribute not present in Set-Cookie responses") / <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/commit/46f6839d1af4e6> . That's the bit which prevents sending the login cookie through cross-origin frames, and mitigates most of the actual fallout here.  I can reproduce this with file:// now, with Firefox against the current RHEL 8.3 cloud image:      qemu-system-x86_64 -cpu host -enable-kvm -nographic -m 2048 -drive file=rhel-guest-image-8.3-401.x86_64.qcow2,if=virtio -snapshot -cdrom cloud-init.iso -net nic,model=virtio -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2201-:22,hostfwd=tcp::9999-:9090  So indeed this only really affects Cockpit < 236, i.e. RHEL 8.3 and below. Of course setting XFO should still be done (and we'll land that).   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c26)  Sandro Bonazzola    2021-09-23 07:00:47 UTC  ``` (In reply to Martin Pitt from [comment #25](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c25))  > So indeed this only really affects Cockpit < 236, i.e. RHEL 8.3 and below. > Of course setting XFO should still be done (and we'll land that).  So it seems this also affects RHEL 7.9 right?   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c27)  Martin Pitt    2021-09-23 09:35:48 UTC  ``` Sandro, correct.   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c31)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-05-10 14:53:49 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2022:2008 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:2008](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A2008)   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=1980688#c32)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-05-11 07:16:26 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2021-3660>   ``` |  |

| Cockpit has initial support for client certificate (aka smart card) logins. This is currently only supported for machines joined to IdM (FreeIPA or AD) where you import and compare against the full client certificate with `org.freedesktop.sssd.infopipe.Users.FindByCertificate()`. There is no further validation of the certificate right now.  We'd like to make this both more robust and also allow this with certmap `matchrule`s. For the latter it's absolutely crucial to ensure that the certificate is signed by an admin-specified CA, plus the usual extra checks (CRL file or OCSP, as configured). It's not strictly necessary for full certificate imports, but it'd be a desirable hardening step anyway.  For that we would like to have a D-Bus API that exposes sssd's cert validation. Right now that's done internally by pam\_sss and the like, they apparently do cert validation and cert mapping as two distinct steps. There are reasons why they are separate ([@sumit-bose](https://github.com/sumit-bose) mentioned on the meeting that mapping is done more often and is much cheaper than validation), so it should have a separate API as well. Something like `org.freedesktop.sssd.infopipe.Users.ValidateCertificate s → void` which gets the certificate PEM and throws a DbusError on failures, or alternatively returns a success/error code.  cockpit could then attempt to use that new API, and if the method does not exist, fall back to the current behaviour or do something more heuristic (like, erroring out when the mapped user is local, as then it's most likely a certmap one), and eventually require the new API.  The most important aspect of this is that this keeps the configuration like `pam_cert_db_path`, `crl_file`, `ocsp_*` etc. in sssd.conf and conf.d. cockpit-tls neither should (too complex) nor could (files are readable for root only) inspect these. It also avoids code duplication, as sssd already has all that validation logic.  As a kind of bonus it would be nice to expose the CA as a property on the InfoPipe object (or a `GetCA()` method), *if* it was set in the config. This would allow the server to send the expected CAs (or at least its properties) with the TLS handshake, using [gnutls-x509-trust-list-add-cas()](https://gnutls.org/reference/gnutls-x509.html#gnutls-x509-trust-list-add-cas) or a similar function. This may allow the web browser a more intelligent pre-selection of available certificates. But that's not crucial, and I'm also happy to split that out into a separate issue.  Thanks!

| Mostly note to ourselves: I was wondering about how much configuration beyond `realm join` is needed on the clients -- ideally none, provided that client certificates get created/signed by IPA's builtin CA. In sssd, the default value of `ca_db` and `pam_cert_db_path` is `/etc/sssd/pki/sssd_auth_ca_db.pem`. But joining a domain does *not* create that file.  [@sumit-bose](https://github.com/sumit-bose) mentioned that [ipa-advise](https://www.freeipa.org/page/V4/Smartcard_authentication_ipa-advise_recipes#enable_client_certificate_logins_on_clients) has a recipe for that, but ipa-advise is not installed by default on a joined machine (as it's primarily a tool for configuring the IdM server) -- in fact, it's not even present any more in Fedora.  I ran it on the IPA server (it got renamed to `config-client-for-smart-card-auth`), that indeed does set up /etc/sssd/pki/sssd\_auth\_ca\_db.pem; it does a lot of other things as well, which may or may not be desirable, but at that point I trust that it's reasonable. :-) So that would be a part of the documentation, even though it does feel a bit like an "unbreak my setup" step. That may be an enhancement request for freeipa-client to set up sssd's CA by default. |

I.e. whatever pam\_sss is using, expose that on D-Bus?  Hi,  CRL validation is not enabled by default because it is typically not clear if a CRL is available and where it is stored (by default we use OCSP based checks). To enable CRL checks you have to add  ``` certificate_verification = crl_file=/PATH/TO/CRL/FILE  ```  to the [sssd] section in `sssd.conf`. If the `certificate_verification` option is already used, just add `crl_file=/PATH/TO/CRL/FILE` to the end separated with a comma, see man sssd.conf for details.  HTH  bye, Sumit |

| [@sumit-bose](https://github.com/sumit-bose) : That seems fine, IMHO CRLs are not really that practical in many circumstances -- you can just remove the old cert from FreeIPA after all. I think the aspect of validating against the configured CA is the main issue here. |

| I tried this with sssd 2.6.1 which is now available in Fedora 35. In FreeIPA I created a new user "alice" and a certificate:  ``` ipa user-add --first=Alice --last="Developer" --shell=/bin/bash alice openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -nodes -keyout /tmp/alice.key -out /tmp/alice.csr -subj '/CN=alice' ipa cert-request /tmp/alice.csr --principal=alice --certificate-out=/tmp/alice.pem  ```  I was piecing this together from <https://www.freeipa.org/page/V4/User_Certificates> . Unfortunately all of the referenced blog posts don't exist any more, but the "how to test" still seems valid.  This automatically assigns the certificate to the `alice` user, i.e. this does not require `ipa user-add-cert alice`. I do see the certificate in `ipa user-show alice`.  Now I copied /tmp/alice.pem to my IPA client machine, which is joined to that domain. The certificate is valid:  ``` # openssl verify -show_chain -CAfile /etc/ipa/ca.crt /var/tmp/alice.pem  /var/tmp/alice.pem: OK Chain: depth=0: O = COCKPIT.LAN, CN = alice (untrusted) depth=1: O = COCKPIT.LAN, CN = Certificate Authority  ```  Note that it doesn't require the `-CAfile /etc/ipa/ca.crt` as that's already part of the system's default trusted CAs, but it doesn't hurt to be explicit about it.  The old API (without validity checks) can see it just fine:  ``` # busctl call org.freedesktop.sssd.infopipe /org/freedesktop/sssd/infopipe/Users org.freedesktop.sssd.infopipe.Users FindByCertificate s -- "$(cat /var/tmp/alice.pem)" o "/org/freedesktop/sssd/infopipe/Users/cockpit_2elan/200400001"  ```  so I am reasonably sure that the cert creation, assignment, and IPA configuration are working. But with this new API I get failures:  ``` # busctl call org.freedesktop.sssd.infopipe /org/freedesktop/sssd/infopipe/Users org.freedesktop.sssd.infopipe.Users FindByValidCertificate s -- "$(cat /var/tmp/alice.pem)" Call failed: 1432158296: Invalid certificate provided  ```  In `tail -f /var/log/sssd/*` I see:  ``` ==> /var/log/sssd/p11_child.log <== (2021-12-07 13:04:14): [p11_child[3521]] [init_verification] (0x0040): X509_LOOKUP_load_file failed [33558530][error:02001002:system library:fopen:No such file or directory]. ********************** PREVIOUS MESSAGE WAS TRIGGERED BY THE FOLLOWING BACKTRACE:    *  (2021-12-07 13:04:14): [p11_child[3521]] [main] (0x0400): p11_child started.    *  (2021-12-07 13:04:14): [p11_child[3521]] [main] (0x2000): Running in [verify] mode.    *  (2021-12-07 13:04:14): [p11_child[3521]] [main] (0x2000): Running with effective IDs: [0][0].    *  (2021-12-07 13:04:14): [p11_child[3521]] [main] (0x2000): Running with real IDs [0][0].    *  (2021-12-07 13:04:14): [p11_child[3521]] [init_verification] (0x0040): X509_LOOKUP_load_file failed [33558530][error:02001002:system library:fopen:No such file or directory]. ********************** BACKTRACE DUMP ENDS HERE *********************************  (2021-12-07 13:04:14): [p11_child[3521]] [do_work] (0x0040): init_verification failed.

But that is a first bug in `FindByValidCertificate()`: If there is no configured CA, then it should either not doing the verification at all, or preferably fail with a more specific error code, so that the client can tell apart "CA not configured, you may consider falling back to FindByCertificate()" from "the certificate actually failed to validate against sssd's configured CA". I'll file this as a separate issue. |

Once I make this ipa-ca hostname an alias for the actual IPA server hostname, the D-Bus call works:  ``` # busctl call org.freedesktop.sssd.infopipe /org/freedesktop/sssd/infopipe/Users org.freedesktop.sssd.infopipe.Users FindByValidCertificate s -- "$(cat /var/tmp/alice.pem)" o "/org/freedesktop/sssd/infopipe/Users/cockpit_2elan/200400001"  ```  (no logs at all in /var/log/sssd/\*).  That OCSP thing is clearly an issue on my side.  So now I am stuck on the question when cockpit should try FindByValidCertificate() and when not -- given that the default `realm join` does *not* set up /etc/sssd/pki/sssd\_auth\_ca\_db.pem, CA validation will simply not work. Parsing `/etc/sssd/{sssd.conf,conf.d/*}` for whether a CA db is set and exists is out of the question for cockpit -- that's the very reason why we needed that new API in the first place, otherwise we could just have done the CA validation by ourselves. This is now isse [#5911](https://github.com/SSSD/sssd/issues/5911), if that gets fixed we'll have all the necessary pieces. Thanks! |

Adding docstring to test_find_by_valid_certificate to define some
metadata for tracking the test case.

Minimal content needed is:
- \"\"\"<test_function_name_next_to_opening_docstring_quotes>
- <blank line after opening quotes>
- :id: <generated UUID>
- :title: SSSD-TC: <Feature or functional area>: <Title of test>
- :casecompoent: sssd
- :subsystemteam: sst_idm_sssd

The id and title will differ per tests going forward but, the last two
are defaults needed.

The opening quotes line needs to include the test function or method
name so that the UUID used for the id is associated with function name
within the docstring.  The blank line is also needed after to indicate
the start of the parameters list.

Command used to generate UUID:
python3 -c 'import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())'

Tests: #5224

New interface to validate a certificate. The input is the certificate to
validate and the output the user path.

:feature: New infopipe method FindByValidCertificate() which accepts the
certificate as input, validates it against configured CAs, and outputs
the user path on success. This is similar to the existing
FindByCertificate(), but that does not do any trust validation.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2004041#c0)  Lev Veyde    2021-09-14 12:18:30 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  When configuring kdump, in case NFS remote configuration is used, cockpit only asks for the NFS mount point, but not the path - the directory to used under that mount point. That unlike the local and SSH configuration types, for which cockpit asks for path/directory.  Moreover, the created configuration that cockpit puts in /etc/kdump.conf in case of NFS, contains only the "nfs" parameter. That causes the default of /var/crash to be used for path. Thus "var/crash" directory stucture must exists under the mount point, or the kdump service will fail to start.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  238.2-1  How reproducible: 100%  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Login into cockpit web interface 2. Select Kernel Dump tab 3. Switch to Remote over NFS 4. Note that only "Mount" field is available 5. Trying to setting a valid mount point will either accept the configuration but cause the kdump service to fail or fail to accept the valid mount point, with an error. 6. Clicking on Apply button again will accept the configuration, but the kdump service will fail.  Actual results: cockpit asks only for NFS mount point for kdump remote NFS configuration  Expected results: Cockpit must ask for path/directory to be used under the NFS mount point, and include it in the kdump configuration file.  Additional info: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1724107](show_bug.cgi?id=1724107 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Kdump service is stopped with an error when changing crash dump location to \"Remote over NFS\" in cockpit UI")   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2004041#c1)  Lev Veyde    2021-09-14 12:27:17 UTC  ``` Also it means that cockpit will need to verify that <NFS mountpoint>/<path> exists, instead of just <NFS mountpoint>.  And as a side note it will be great if cockpit also verifies that the target is writable, and files can be created there.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2004041#c2)  Martin Pitt    2021-09-15 10:02:45 UTC  ``` Confirmed, thanks for the report! That's a really strange configuration API.. The "nfs" option already specifies a remote mount point, so appending "path" to that is just rather unintuitive.  I am currently working on an end-to-end integration test for this and testing NFS dumps. I can confirm this bug, but I can't get NFS dumps to work at all in RHEL 8.5 and Fedora 35. I filed [bug 2004434](show_bug.cgi?id=2004434) about this.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2004041#c3)  Martin Pitt    2021-09-23 09:26:35 UTC  ``` Fixed upstream in <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/16385>  Jan: This has an integration test, but it does not run in gating as it can't be made non-destructive (the kdump test has to reboot)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2004041#c4)  Martin Pitt    2021-09-23 09:29:04 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1724107](show_bug.cgi?id=1724107 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Kdump service is stopped with an error when changing crash dump location to \"Remote over NFS\" in cockpit UI") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2004041#c5)  Martin Pitt    2021-09-23 09:43:50 UTC  ``` Jan: I updated the PR to cover the UI → kdump.conf parts in TestKdump.testConfiguration() (which runs in gating). This should already suffice for this bug, and the upstream CI test can make sure it works end-to-end.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2004041#c6)  Lev Veyde    2021-10-03 07:38:10 UTC  ``` (In reply to Martin Pitt from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=2004041#c2)) > Confirmed, thanks for the report!

Yes, agreed, it's indeed counter intuitive, and not what one may expect - it becomes clear that path is still used for NFS only after carefully reading the kdump docs/conf file comments. And that probably mostly happens only after one has a configuration issue...  Anyway, glad that we caught and fixed the issue.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2004041#c7)  Martin Pitt    2021-10-03 17:21:53 UTC  ``` > Yes, agreed, it's indeed counter intuitive, and not what one may expect  On second thought it actually makes sense. I guess I am way too much used to scp/rsync copying, and not enough with NFS. The NFS share is indeed server:/exported/location, not any arbitrary subpath of that.  Anyway, the fix is in Fedora now, we'll package the current version for 8.6 soon.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=2004041#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-05-10 15:18:37 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

### @martinpitt **[martinpitt](/martinpitt)** commented [Dec 8, 2021](#issue-1074222070) • edited Loading

sssd 2.6.1 introduces a new FindByValidCertificate() method which

validates the given certificate against the configured CA. Use this API

if available, and fall back to FindByCertificate() to keep compatibility

with older distributions.

This enables OCSP/CRL checks, and enables certmap rules in a safe way.

Update TestLogin.testClientCertAuthentication() to adjust the scary

comments, and make sure that certificates without a valid CA are

rejected if the new API is available.

Similarly, adjust check-system-realms to tell sssd about a valid CA, and

test valid/invalid cases.

Update the client certificate docs to show how to set up the CA in sssd,

and adjust the warning: certmap rules are now actually okay with sssd

2.6.1.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1992149>

[CVE-2021-3698](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w9ph-5m4x-c49r "CVE-2021-3698")

---

TODO:

* update FreeIPA cert login docs to use `ipa cert-request`
* add integration test for matching cert with invalid sig (works on older OSes, fails with sssd 2.6.1)
* update `TestLogin.testClientCertAuthentication` for CA validation, certmap rules are safe with this new API
* update documentation: Preview (without CSS) at <https://piware.de/tmp/cert-authentication.html>
* add release note: in particular, point out sssd CA installation requirement on updates

## Certificate login validation: Action required on updates

Earlier Cockpit/sssd versions did not check trust or revocation status of a presented client certificate, and thus certificate/smart card login was secure and supported only when matching the entire binary certificate against the Identity Management's database. With sssd 2.6.1 and Cockpit 260, the certificate signature and revocation status is now validated against the CA [configured in sssd](https://www.mankier.com/5/sssd.conf#Services_Sections-PAM_configuration_options), and any non-trusted certificate is rejected. This includes the case when the local sssd has *no* configured CA, which may break certificate logins after updating cockpit and sssd.

Thus if you use certificate login, you need to set up the trusted CA in sssd. Please see the [certificate authentication documentation](https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/cert-authentication.html#certauth-server-cockpitconf) for details.

This issue was assigned [CVE-2021-3698](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-3698).

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Took me two hours to track down [this failure](https://logs.cockpit-project.org/logs/pull-16703-20211209-061647-c0bea28d-debian-testing/log.html#278) -- turns out it is a rather subtle bug in Debian's libpam-sss package, I reported it at <https://bugs.debian.org/1001377>. There is a simple workaround, though. |

I'm not a big fan of the false perception that this gives that "this is secure now".

I don't like how we fall back to this automatically if we're on older sssd and meanwhile the documentation has been updated to say "this works now!" with only a version warning at the bottom, after the instructions, that probably nobody will get around to reading.

I feel like we should either find a way to match only complete known certificates on older sssd (ie: disable ones that are merely signed by a CA), or not update the docs until this is widely supported and secure.

Another option might be a config flag to enable falling back to this API, but of course, that would break existing users.

Let's chat about how we manage this.

Sorry, something went wrong.

I updated the release note in this PR to drop the "certmap works now" paragraph. Indeed, let's only announce this once sssd 2.6.1 is available more broadly. The patches to the guide only became more strict -- of course I'm happy to adjust the wording in the warning, but it is still true that you can safely ignore the warning completely -- just as before, the guide *still* only documents how to set up complete certificate matching. For that, the only things that changed is (1) that you *must* set the CA in sssd now, and (2) it will now start to check CRL. Neither of this is "this works now", it just makes the whole thing more restrictive.

Due to that, I find that the automatic fallback is acceptable for now. I am not really worried about that at all, I am worried that using the validation API by default now is too much of a regression on upgrades. It's acceptable for Fedora and even RHEL 9, but not really for RHEL 8.6. I would like to refine that, but I need [SSSD/sssd#5911](https://github.com/SSSD/sssd/issues/5911) fixed for that first -- then I can send a follow-up to fall back to the unvalidated API also on "sssd does not have a CA".

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Another random idea: could we package cockpit in such a way that it is marked as broken by old sssd versions, and then drop the fallback?  Only at the price of immediately stopping backportability in Debian/Ubuntu, and Fedora 34. I think at least RHEL 8.6 will get the new sssd, but it's not there yet. So this could only be conditional. But also, why? It's not like the new version makes anything worse? |

I think this can go now, but I'd like to squabble over the release note a bit more. In particular, the "with this version and sssd version..." text is a bit too easy to scan over.

sssd 2.6.1 introduces a new FindByValidCertificate() method which
validates the given certificate against the configured CA. Use this API
if available, and fall back to FindByCertificate() to keep compatibility
with older distributions.

This enables OCSP/CRL checks, and enables certmap rules in a safe way.
Update TestLogin.testClientCertAuthentication() to adjust the scary
comments, and make sure that certificates without a valid CA are
rejected if the new API is available.

Similarly, adjust check-system-realms to tell sssd about a valid CA, and
test valid/invalid cases.

Update the client certificate docs to show how to set up the CA in sssd,
and adjust the warning: certmap rules are now actually okay with sssd

## Certificate/smart card authentication

[Authentication to other services like sudo and ssh](cert-authentication.html#certauth-forwarding)

Cockpit can use TLS client certificates for authenticating users. Commonly
these are provided by a smart card, but it's equally possible to import
certificates directly into the web browser.

This requires the host to be in an Identity Management domain like
[FreeIPA](https://www.freeipa.org) or
[Active Directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory),
which can associate certificates to users.

To authenticate users from a Identity Management domain, the server that
Cockpit is running on must be joined to that domain. See the
[SSO server requirements](sso.html#sso-server "Server Requirements") for details.

## User certificate generation

Generating the certificates for users is usually done with a certificate management system like
[certmonger](https://pagure.io/certmonger) or
[FreeIPA](https://www.freeipa.org/page/PKI), which are not documented here.
This command generates a simple key and certificate request for the "alice" user:

```

openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 \
    -keyout alice.key -out alice.csr -subj "/CN=alice"

```

Now get this certificate request signed by the Certificate Authority of your Identity
Management domain, to get a PEM certificate. Browsers and smart cart utilities accept PKCS#12 format
for importing/transfer, so convert the certificate/key pair; it will ask for and protect it
with a transfer password:

```

openssl pkcs12 -export -in alice.pem -inkey alice.key -out alice.p12

```

Don't forget to clean up the key file when you do not need it any more:

```

shred -u alice.key

```

You can now import `alice.p12` directly into your browser,
with giving the transfer password set above. Or
[put the certificate onto a smart card](https://linux.die.net/man/1/pkcs15-init):

```

pkcs15-init --store-private-key alice.p12 --format pkcs12 --auth-id 01

```

## Certificate mapping with FreeIPA

The recommended method to sign a user certificate request and associate it to a user is
**ipa cert-request**:

```

ipa cert-request alice.csr --principal=alice --certificate-out=alice.pem

```

Alternatively, if you are using a different CA, you can use
**ipa user-add-cert** to associate the signed certificate to the user.
This expects PEM format, but without the `-----BEGIN`/`-----END`
markers:

```

ipa user-add-cert alice --certificate="$(grep -v ^---- alice.pem)"

```

See the [FreeIPA User Certificates documentation](https://www.freeipa.org/page/V4/User_Certificates#Feature_Management) for details.

## Certificate mapping with Microsoft Active Directory

The domain user certificates get imported into the `userCertificate;binary`
LDAP attribute. The following commands convert the PEM certificate into binary DER form, create an
[LDIF](https://ldap.com/ldif-the-ldap-data-interchange-format/)
file and apply it to the LDAP server running on the domain controller
"dc.example.com":

```

openssl x509 -outform der -in alice.pem -out alice.der

cat <<EOF > alice.ldif
version: 1
dn: cn=alice,ou=users,ou=YOUR_NETBIOS_NAME,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
add: userCertificate;binary
userCertificate;binary:< file://$(pwd)/alice.der
EOF

ldapmodify -H ldap://dc.example.com -f alice.ldif

```

## Certificate mapping with Samba Active Directory

At least some versions of [Samba](https://www.samba.org/)
do not support the `userCertificate;binary` LDAP attribute, so the
import has to happen in base64 PEM form into the textual
`userCertificate` attribute instead. Also, Samba uses a slightly
different user hierarchy:

```

cat <<EOF > alice.ldif
version: 1
dn: cn=alice,cn=users,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
add: userCertificate
userCertificate: $(grep -v ^---- alice.pem | tr -d '\n')
EOF

ldapmodify -H ldap://dc.example.com  -f alice.ldif

```

As `userCertificate` is a text instead of binary field, you need to set up a
[certificate mapping rule](https://www.mankier.com/5/sssd.conf#Certificate_Mapping_Section)
in sssd.conf(5)
in a `[certmap/domain/rulename]` section, for example:

```

[certmap/example.com/adcerts]
# we match full certificates, so it is not important to check anything here
matchrule = <KU>digitalSignature
maprule = LDAP:(userCertificate={cert!base64})

```

## Cockpit web server configuration

Set the trusted Certificate Authority of your user certificates in **sssd**,
either by copying the CA PEM file to `/etc/sssd/pki/sssd_auth_ca_db.pem` or setting the
[**pam\_cert\_db\_path**](https://www.mankier.com/5/sssd.conf#Services_Sections-PAM_configuration_options) configuration option to the path of the CA.
If you use FreeIPA and its CA:

```

cp /etc/ipa/ca.crt /etc/sssd/pki/sssd_auth_ca_db.pem

```

Certificate authentication needs to be enabled in
[cockpit.conf](./cockpit.conf.5.html) explicitly:

```

[WebService]
ClientCertAuthentication = yes

```

When enabling this mode,
[other authentication types](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/blob/main/doc/authentication.md) commonly get disabled, so that *only*
client certificate authentication will be accepted. By default, after a failed certificate
authentication attempt, Cockpit's normal login page will appear and permit other login types
such as `basic` (passwords) or `negotiate` (Kerberos). For example,
password authentication gets disabled with:

```

[basic]
action = none

```

## Cockpit web server resource limits

When using certificate authentication, all requests with a particular
certificate will be handled by a separate and isolated instance of the
[cockpit-ws](./cockpit-ws.8.html) web server. This
protects against possible vulnerabilities in the web server and prevents
an attacker from impersonating another user. However, this introduces a
potential Denial of Service: Some remote attacker could create a
large number of certificates and send a large number of http requests
to Cockpit with these.

To mitigate that, all `cockpit-ws` instances run
in a `system-cockpithttps.slice`
[systemd slice unit](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.slice.html)
which [limits
the collective resources](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.resource-control.html) of these web server instances: by default,
this slice sets a limit of 200 threads (roughly 100 instances of `cockpit-ws` -- in other
words, a maximum of 100 parallel user sessions with different certificates) and
a 75% (soft)/90% (hard) memory limit.

You are welcome to adjust these limits to your need through
a [drop-in](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html).
For example:

```

# systemctl edit system-cockpithttps.slice

[Slice]
# change existing value
TasksMax=100
# add new restriction
CPUQuota=30%

```

## Authentication to other services like sudo and ssh

Once you logged into Cockpit with a certificate, you likely need to switch to administrative mode
(root privileges through sudo), or connect to remote machines through SSH. If your user account has a password,
that can be used for authenticating to sudo or ssh as usual.

*Supported with FreeIPA only:* As an alternative to password authentication, you can
also declare the initial Cockpit certificate authentication as trusted for authenticating to SSH,
sudo, or other services. For that purpose, Cockpit automatically creates an
[S4U2Proxy Kerberos ticket](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-sfu/bde93b0e-f3c9-4ddf-9f44-e1453be7af5a)
in the user session:

```

$ klist
Ticket cache: FILE:/run/user/1894000001/cockpit-session-3692.ccache
Default principal: user@EXAMPLE.COM

Valid starting     Expires            Service principal
07/30/21 09:19:06  07/31/21 09:19:06  HTTP/myhost.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
07/30/21 09:19:06  07/31/21 09:19:06  krbtgt/EXAMPLE.COM@EXAMPLE.COM
	for client HTTP/myhost.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM

```

You can set up [constrained delegation rules](https://www.freeipa.org/page/V4/Service_Constraint_Delegation)
to enumerate which hosts (including its own) that ticket is trusted to access. For example, if the cockpit session runs on host
`myhost.example.com` and should be trusted to access its own host (through sudo) and another host
`remote.example.com` (through ssh), create a delegation like this:

```

# a list of target machines which can be accessed by a particular rule
ipa servicedelegationtarget-add cockpit-target
ipa servicedelegationtarget-add-member cockpit-target \
  --principals=host/myhost.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM \
  --principals=host/remote.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM

# allow cockpit sessions (HTTP/ principal) to access that host list
ipa servicedelegationrule-add cockpit-delegation
ipa servicedelegationrule-add-member cockpit-delegation \
  --principals=HTTP/myhost.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
ipa servicedelegationrule-add-target cockpit-delegation \
  --servicedelegationtargets=cockpit-target

```

In addition, you need to enable GSS (Kerberos) authentication in the corresponding services.

* For SSH, enable `GSSAPIAuthentication yes` in
  [/etc/ssh/sshd\_config](https://linux.die.net/man/5/sshd_config).
* For sudo, enable `pam_sss_gss` as described in the
  [manpage](https://www.mankier.com/8/pam_sss_gss):
  In `/etc/sssd/sssd.conf`: Add an entry for your domain:

  ```

  [domain/example.com]
  pam_gssapi_services = sudo, sudo-i

  ```

  In `/etc/pam.d/sudo`, enable the module in the first line:

  ```

  auth sufficient pam_sss_gss.so

  ```

*Caveat:* The delegated S4U ticket is not yet forwarded to remote SSH
hosts when connecting to them from Cockpit, so authenticating to sudo on the remote host with
that ticket does not work. This will be provided in a future version.

## Certificate/smart card authentication

[Certificate mapping with FreeIPA](cert-authentication.html#certauth-server-ipa)
[Certificate mapping with Microsoft Active Directory](cert-authentication.html#certauth-server-ms-ad)

[Cockpit web server resource limits](cert-authentication.html#certauth-server-resourcelimits)
[Authentication to other services like sudo and ssh](cert-authentication.html#certauth-forwarding)

Cockpit can use TLS client certificates for authenticating users. Commonly
these are provided by a smart card, but it's equally possible to import
certificates directly into the web browser.

This requires the host to be in an Identity Management domain like
[FreeIPA](https://www.freeipa.org) or
[Active Directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory),
which can associate certificates to users.

To authenticate users from a Identity Management domain, the server that
Cockpit is running on must be joined to that domain. See the
[SSO server requirements](sso.html#sso-server "Server Requirements") for details.

## User certificate generation

Generating the certificates for users is usually done with a certificate management system like
[certmonger](https://pagure.io/certmonger) or
[FreeIPA](https://www.freeipa.org/page/PKI), which are not documented here.
This command generates a simple key and certificate request for the "alice" user:

```

openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 \
    -keyout alice.key -out alice.csr -subj "/CN=alice"

```

Now get this certificate request signed by the Certificate Authority of your Identity
Management domain, to get a PEM certificate. Browsers and smart cart utilities accept PKCS#12 format
for importing/transfer, so convert the certificate/key pair; it will ask for and protect it
with a transfer password:

```

openssl pkcs12 -export -in alice.pem -inkey alice.key -out alice.p12

```

Don't forget to clean up the key file when you do not need it any more:

```

shred -u alice.key

```

You can now import `alice.p12` directly into your browser,
with giving the transfer password set above. Or
[put the certificate onto a smart card](https://linux.die.net/man/1/pkcs15-init):

```

pkcs15-init --store-private-key alice.p12 --format pkcs12 --auth-id 01

```

## Certificate mapping with FreeIPA

The recommended method to sign a user certificate request and associate it to a user is
**ipa cert-request**:

```

ipa cert-request alice.csr --principal=alice --certificate-out=alice.pem

```

Alternatively, if you are using a different CA, you can use
**ipa user-add-cert** to associate the signed certificate to the user.
This expects PEM format, but without the `-----BEGIN`/`-----END`
markers:

```

ipa user-add-cert alice --certificate="$(grep -v ^---- alice.pem)"

```

See the [FreeIPA User Certificates documentation](https://www.freeipa.org/page/V4/User_Certificates#Feature_Management) for details.

## Certificate mapping with Microsoft Active Directory

The domain user certificates get imported into the `userCertificate;binary`
LDAP attribute. The following commands convert the PEM certificate into binary DER form, create an
[LDIF](https://ldap.com/ldif-the-ldap-data-interchange-format/)
file and apply it to the LDAP server running on the domain controller
"dc.example.com":

```

openssl x509 -outform der -in alice.pem -out alice.der

cat <<EOF > alice.ldif
version: 1
dn: cn=alice,ou=users,ou=YOUR_NETBIOS_NAME,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
add: userCertificate;binary
userCertificate;binary:< file://$(pwd)/alice.der
EOF

ldapmodify -H ldap://dc.example.com -f alice.ldif

```

## Certificate mapping with Samba Active Directory

At least some versions of [Samba](https://www.samba.org/)
do not support the `userCertificate;binary` LDAP attribute, so the
import has to happen in base64 PEM form into the textual
`userCertificate` attribute instead. Also, Samba uses a slightly
different user hierarchy:

```

cat <<EOF > alice.ldif
version: 1
dn: cn=alice,cn=users,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
add: userCertificate
userCertificate: $(grep -v ^---- alice.pem | tr -d '\n')
EOF

ldapmodify -H ldap://dc.example.com  -f alice.ldif

```

As `userCertificate` is a text instead of binary field, you need to set up a
[certificate mapping rule](https://www.mankier.com/5/sssd.conf#Certificate_Mapping_Section)
in sssd.conf(5)
in a `[certmap/domain/rulename]` section, for example:

```

[certmap/example.com/adcerts]
# we match full certificates, so it is not important to check anything here
matchrule = <KU>digitalSignature
maprule = LDAP:(userCertificate={cert!base64})

```

## Cockpit web server configuration

Set the trusted Certificate Authority of your user certificates in **sssd**,
either by copying the CA PEM file to `/etc/sssd/pki/sssd_auth_ca_db.pem` or setting the
[**pam\_cert\_db\_path**](https://www.mankier.com/5/sssd.conf#Services_Sections-PAM_configuration_options) configuration option to the path of the CA.
If you use FreeIPA and its CA:

```

cp /etc/ipa/ca.crt /etc/sssd/pki/sssd_auth_ca_db.pem

```

Certificate authentication needs to be enabled in
[cockpit.conf](./cockpit.conf.5.html) explicitly:

```

[WebService]
ClientCertAuthentication = yes

```

When enabling this mode,
[other authentication types](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/blob/main/doc/authentication.md) commonly get disabled, so that *only*
client certificate authentication will be accepted. By default, after a failed certificate
authentication attempt, Cockpit's normal login page will appear and permit other login types
such as `basic` (passwords) or `negotiate` (Kerberos). For example,
password authentication gets disabled with:

```

[basic]
action = none

```

## Cockpit web server resource limits

When using certificate authentication, all requests with a particular
certificate will be handled by a separate and isolated instance of the
[cockpit-ws](./cockpit-ws.8.html) web server. This
protects against possible vulnerabilities in the web server and prevents
an attacker from impersonating another user. However, this introduces a
potential Denial of Service: Some remote attacker could create a
large number of certificates and send a large number of http requests
to Cockpit with these.

To mitigate that, all `cockpit-ws` instances run
in a `system-cockpithttps.slice`
[systemd slice unit](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.slice.html)
which [limits
the collective resources](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.resource-control.html) of these web server instances: by default,
this slice sets a limit of 200 threads (roughly 100 instances of `cockpit-ws` -- in other
words, a maximum of 100 parallel user sessions with different certificates) and
a 75% (soft)/90% (hard) memory limit.

You are welcome to adjust these limits to your need through
a [drop-in](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html).
For example:

```

# systemctl edit system-cockpithttps.slice

[Slice]
# change existing value
TasksMax=100
# add new restriction
CPUQuota=30%

```

## Authentication to other services like sudo and ssh

Once you logged into Cockpit with a certificate, you likely need to switch to administrative mode
(root privileges through sudo), or connect to remote machines through SSH. If your user account has a password,
that can be used for authenticating to sudo or ssh as usual.

*Supported with FreeIPA only:* As an alternative to password authentication, you can
also declare the initial Cockpit certificate authentication as trusted for authenticating to SSH,
sudo, or other services. For that purpose, Cockpit automatically creates an
[S4U2Proxy Kerberos ticket](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-sfu/bde93b0e-f3c9-4ddf-9f44-e1453be7af5a)
in the user session:

```

$ klist
Ticket cache: FILE:/run/user/1894000001/cockpit-session-3692.ccache
Default principal: user@EXAMPLE.COM

Valid starting     Expires            Service principal
07/30/21 09:19:06  07/31/21 09:19:06  HTTP/myhost.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
07/30/21 09:19:06  07/31/21 09:19:06  krbtgt/EXAMPLE.COM@EXAMPLE.COM
	for client HTTP/myhost.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM

```

You can set up [constrained delegation rules](https://www.freeipa.org/page/V4/Service_Constraint_Delegation)
to enumerate which hosts (including its own) that ticket is trusted to access. For example, if the cockpit session runs on host
`myhost.example.com` and should be trusted to access its own host (through sudo) and another host
`remote.example.com` (through ssh), create a delegation like this:

```

# a list of target machines which can be accessed by a particular rule
ipa servicedelegationtarget-add cockpit-target
ipa servicedelegationtarget-add-member cockpit-target \
  --principals=host/myhost.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM \
  --principals=host/remote.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM

# allow cockpit sessions (HTTP/ principal) to access that host list
ipa servicedelegationrule-add cockpit-delegation
ipa servicedelegationrule-add-member cockpit-delegation \
  --principals=HTTP/myhost.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
ipa servicedelegationrule-add-target cockpit-delegation \
  --servicedelegationtargets=cockpit-target

```

In addition, you need to enable GSS (Kerberos) authentication in the corresponding services.

* For SSH, enable `GSSAPIAuthentication yes` in
  [/etc/ssh/sshd\_config](https://linux.die.net/man/5/sshd_config).
* For sudo, enable `pam_sss_gss` as described in the
  [manpage](https://www.mankier.com/8/pam_sss_gss):
  In `/etc/sssd/sssd.conf`: Add an entry for your domain:

  ```

  [domain/example.com]
  pam_gssapi_services = sudo, sudo-i

  ```

  In `/etc/pam.d/sudo`, enable the module in the first line:

  ```

  auth sufficient pam_sss_gss.so

  ```

*Caveat:* The delegated S4U ticket is not yet forwarded to remote SSH
hosts when connecting to them from Cockpit, so authenticating to sudo on the remote host with
that ticket does not work. This will be provided in a future version.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1992149#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-08-10 16:30:23 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Cockpit in the way it handles the certificate verification performed by SSSD and allows client certificates to successfully authenticate regardless of the CRL configuration or the certificate status.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1992149#c4)  gkamathe    2021-08-17 16:33:02 UTC  ``` (1) This is not currently a supported use case. The documentation [0] warns that cockpit doesn't do any meaningful verification of the certificate (it does reject expired ones, but no CA/CRL). This behaviour is not a secret, so it might be beneficial to make this unembargoed, to have a pointer for other affected users.  (2) Fixing this properly requires adding a validation D-Bus API to sssd [1]. I filed [bug 1992432](show_bug.cgi?id=1992432 "CLOSED ERRATA - Add client certificate validation D-Bus API (dependency of cockpit CVE-2021-3698 fix)") for tracking this.  [0] <https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/cert-authentication.html> [1] <https://github.com/SSSD/sssd/issues/5224>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1992149#c7)  Sandipan Roy    2021-08-27 12:49:25 UTC  ``` Created cockpit tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1998513](show_bug.cgi?id=1998513 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2021-3698 cockpit: authenticates with revoked certificates [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1992149#c8)  Sandro Bonazzola    2021-08-27 13:15:40 UTC  ``` Is this going to be fixed for RHEL 7? I'm asking because we got a tracker opened on RHV-M 4.3 ([bug #1993783](show_bug.cgi?id=1993783) ) which is cross-shipping cockpit from RHEL 7 and if it's not going to be fixed there we should close it as well for RHV-M.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1992149#c9)  Martin Pitt    2021-08-27 14:35:39 UTC  ``` Sandro: No, it does not affect RHEL 7, the certificate auth functionality is RHEL 8/9 only (introduced in version 208, and RHEL 7 has Cockpit 195).   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1992149#c11)  Martin Pitt    2021-12-09 15:08:35 UTC  ``` With sssd 2.6.1 now being available in at least Fedora 35 and Debian testing, I worked on using this new API in Cockpit: <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/16703>  This includes integration tests and documentation, and falling back to the pre-2.6.1 API (where only full binary matching is supported). Review much appreciated!  Thanks again to the sssd team, in particular Iker Pedrosa, for adding the validation API!  As this breaks existing systems on upgrades, I add Lucie to CC: you now *have* to configure a CA in sssd for cert logins to work, and unfortunately `realm join` does not do this automatically for IPA. The upstream release note (in the PR, going to be in the release blog) and the upstream docs (once the PR lands) have the details.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1992149#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-05-10 14:53:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2022:2008 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:2008](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A2008)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1992149#c15)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-05-11 07:46:54 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2021-3698>   ``` |  |
