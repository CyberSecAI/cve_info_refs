Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-3698:

**1. Verification of Content:**

The content provided directly relates to CVE-2021-3698, which is described as a flaw in Cockpit's handling of certificate verification by SSSD. The provided text includes discussion about the vulnerability, its impact, affected versions, and fixes.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is that Cockpit, in versions prior to 260, did not properly validate client certificates against the configured Certificate Authority (CA), nor did it check Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs). Specifically, it relied on the `FindByCertificate()` method which does not perform trust validation. This allowed revoked or untrusted certificates to authenticate successfully.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Certificate Validation:** Cockpit was not verifying the validity of client certificates against the configured CA or CRLs.
*   **Reliance on Insecure API:** Cockpit used the `FindByCertificate` API of SSSD instead of using a more robust API for validation.
*   **Automatic Fallback:** Cockpit would automatically fall back to the insecure `FindByCertificate` method on older SSSD versions without a clear indication to the user.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass Authentication:** An attacker could potentially use a revoked or untrusted client certificate to authenticate to Cockpit.
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to the Cockpit interface, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*   **Insecure System Access:** If an attacker gained unauthorized access to the Cockpit interface, they could potentially perform malicious actions on the affected server.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:**  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability remotely if they have access to the Cockpit login page.
*   **Client Certificate:** The attacker needs to possess or create a client certificate that would normally be rejected by proper validation.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Cockpit Login:** The attacker must be able to access the Cockpit login page.
*   **Malicious Certificate:** The attacker must have access to a certificate that was either revoked or is not trusted by the SSSD configuration.
*   **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability, it can happen transparently.

**Additional Details and Technical Information**

*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed by using a new D-Bus API in sssd (FindByValidCertificate), introduced in sssd 2.6.1, that validates the certificates against the configured CA and CRLs. The fix also includes documentation updates, release notes, and modifications of the tests.
*   **Affected versions:** Cockpit versions prior to 260
*   **Mitigation:** Setting up the trusted CA in sssd to ensure proper verification of certificates is essential for systems using certificate-based authentication.  This is done by copying the CA PEM file to `/etc/sssd/pki/sssd_auth_ca_db.pem` or by setting the `pam_cert_db_path` option in `/etc/sssd/sssd.conf`.
*   **Red Hat Solution**: The vulnerability is addressed in RHSA-2022:2008 which includes Cockpit 264.1.
*   **SSSD API:** SSSD versions < 2.6.1 do not implement the `FindByValidCertificate()` API call, so an automatic fallback to the insecure `FindByCertificate()` function was put into place when old SSSD versions are detected.
*   **Samba AD**: Samba AD environments are not directly addressed, and require setting up cert mapping rules to validate certificates.
