Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the memory deduplication mechanisms present in operating systems (both Windows and Linux). These mechanisms merge identical memory blocks into copy-on-write mappings to reduce memory usage. While intended for efficiency, this deduplication process can be exploited as a side channel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Exploitation of Memory Deduplication:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to exploit memory deduplication remotely, without requiring local code execution on the target system.
*   **Timing Side Channel:** The vulnerability stems from the timing differences that occur when a deduplicated page is written to. A copy-on-write (COW) operation occurs, resulting in increased latency compared to accessing a non-deduplicated page. This difference is detectable over the network.
*   **Intra-Domain Deduplication Vulnerability:** Modern systems often restrict memory deduplication to within a security domain to mitigate cross-domain attacks, this research reveals that even intra-domain deduplication can still be exploited remotely.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can leak memory contents from a remote server by sending and timing HTTP requests. This can include sensitive data like database records, the presence of specific data in memory, libc versions, and kernel addresses.
*   **KASLR Break:** Attackers can break Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) remotely, which is used to protect against memory corruption bugs by randomizing kernel addresses.
*   **Operating System Fingerprinting:** Attackers can determine the operating system version and shared libraries in use on a server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote HTTP Requests:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending carefully crafted HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 requests to a target server.
*   **Timing Analysis:** Attackers measure the round-trip time of network requests to detect the timing differences caused by copy-on-write page faults.
*   **Data Injection:** The attacker injects data into the memory of the target server (via API calls or services) and times the requests upon modification, deducing if deduplication occurred.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers require network connectivity to the victim server.
*   **Ability to Send Arbitrary Data:** Attackers need to be able to send controlled data to the target server (e.g., via API endpoints that allow for data uploads/modifications).
*   **Accurate Timing Measurement:** The attacker needs a reasonably accurate method for measuring the round-trip time of network requests.
*   **Knowledge of Target Environment**: In the case of KASLR breaking and library fingerprinting, the attacker needs some knowledge of the target operating system version and common library versions, in order to create memory pages with the matching content
*   **No Local Code Execution:**  Crucially, the attacker does *not* require the ability to execute arbitrary code on the target server.

**Technical Details:**

*   The attack exploits copy-on-write page faults to create a timing side-channel, when a write is performed on a deduplicated page, the page must be copied first.
*   The timing differences are amplified by creating multiple deduplicated pages, which all trigger copy-on-write at once.
*   The attack was successfully demonstrated on Windows and Linux systems using server software like Memcached, MariaDB (InnoDB), and the Linux kernel itself.
*   The attack can leak data at rates of 34.41 B/h over the internet and 302.16 B/h in a local area network.
*  The attacks use a combination of memory massaging via InnoDB reorganization and deduplication via Memcached as a second channel.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2021-3714.
*   This vulnerability is not fixed upstream as of the time of the provided information, and the issue has been classified as "WONTFIX" by Red Hat.
