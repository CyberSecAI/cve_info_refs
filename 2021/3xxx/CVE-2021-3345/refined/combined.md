**What should I download? What do I do with these files?**

[Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)

Please see the [Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)
for the complete installation documentation.
It explains how you can find the right architecture for your machine and which files you need at what stage of the installation process.

In brief, a **stage 3** is a minimal set of Gentoo binaries that can upgrade and expand itself (but not much more, i.e., no kernel
or boot loader). The desktop version already contains additional programs needed in a typical desktop installation. The installation CD can be
used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

### [amd64 – Advanced choices](#amd64-advanced)

#### Processor compatibility

 **Processor compatibility**

The *amd64* architecture is intended for use on AMD 64-bit CPUs as well as 64-bit **Intel Pentium/Core/Xeon** processors.

 **QCOW2 disk images**

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

The *ilp32d* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *ilp32* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.

| [Description](#c0)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-01-19 23:19:32 UTC  ``` libgcrypt 1.9 appears to have a few security fixes:     - Fix infinite loop due to applications using fork the wrong      way.  [#3491][also in 1.8.4]    - Fix possible leak of a few bits of secret primes to pageable      memory.  [#3848][also in 1.8.4]    - Fix possible hang in the RNG (1.8.3 only).  [#4034][also in 1.8.4]    - Use blinding for ECDSA signing to mitigate a novel side-channel      attack.  [#4011,CVE-2018-0495] [also in 1.8.3, 1.7.10]    - Fix rare assertion failure in gcry_prime_check.  [also in 1.8.3]    - Add mitigation against ECC timing attack CVE-2019-13626.  [#4626]  The CVE here was CVE-2019-13627 according to the upstream issue, not CVE-2019-13626. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Lars Wendler (Polynomial-C) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2021-01-20 08:19:50 UTC  ``` Just to be clear here, CVE-2019-13627 seems to be the only fix that is not in currently available versions in Gentoo. We have 1.8.6 in stable and 1.8.7 in unstable. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Mikle Kolyada (RETIRED)   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-01-20 09:01:02 UTC  ``` 1.9.0 is in the tree ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-01-20 20:17:24 UTC  ``` x86 done ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-01-20 20:17:44 UTC  ``` amd64 done ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-01-20 20:18:09 UTC  ``` arm done ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-01-20 20:53:48 UTC  ``` arm64 done ```   [Comment 7](#c7)  NATTkA bot   gentoo-dev  2021-01-29 09:04:55 UTC  Comment hidden (obsolete)  ``` Unable to check for sanity:  > package masked: dev-libs/libgcrypt-1.9.0 ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Larry the Git Cow   gentoo-dev  2021-01-29 13:19:13 UTC  ``` The bug has been referenced in the following commit(s):  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=d554d368f2cc68c944b92c2a64be391ca272eac1>  commit d554d368f2cc68c944b92c2a64be391ca272eac1 Author:     Sam James <sam@gentoo.org> AuthorDate: 2021-01-29 13:10:07 +0000 Commit:     Sam James <sam@gentoo.org> CommitDate: 2021-01-29 13:10:07 +0000      dev-libs/libgcrypt: (security) bump to 1.9.1          This includes a critical security fix on 1.9.0 (currently masked).

```
Hello!

We have to announce the availability of Libgcrypt version 1.9.1.
This version fixes a *critical security bug* in the recently released
version 1.9.0.  If you are already using 1.9.0 please update immediately
to 1.9.1.

Libgcrypt is a general purpose library of cryptographic building blocks.
It is originally based on code used by GnuPG.  It does not provide any
implementation of OpenPGP or other protocols.  Thorough understanding of
applied cryptography is required to use Libgcrypt.

Impact and timeline
===================

Only one released version is affected:

 - Libgcrypt 1.9.0 (released 2021-01-19)

All other versions are not affected.

On 2021-01-28 Tavis Ormandy contacted us to report a severe bug in 1.9.0
which he found while testing GnuPG:

  There is a heap buffer overflow in libgcrypt due to an incorrect
  assumption in the block buffer management code. Just decrypting some
  data can overflow a heap buffer with attacker controlled data, no
  verification or signature is validated before the vulnerability
  occurs.

The bug was introduced during the the 1.9 development phase about two
years ago with commit e76617cbab018dd8f41fd6b4ec6740b5303f7e13 (Reduce
overhead on generic hash write function).

Exploiting this bug is simple and thus immediate action for 1.9.0 users
is required.  A CVE-id has not yet been assigned.  We track this bug at
<https://dev.gnupg.org/T5275.>  The 1.9.0 tarballs on our FTP server have
been renamed so that scripts won't be able to get this version anymore.

Solution
========

If Libgcrypt versions 1.9.0 is in use please update immediately to
version 1.9.1.

If you are using the 1.8 LTS branch you are not affected.  While you are
checking anyway please make sure that you have at least 1.8.5.

If you are using a development version build taken from our Git
repository you need to update as well.  NB: The use of non-released
versions in a production environment is strongly discouraged.

There is yet no released GnuPG version hich requires Libgcrypt 1.9

Download
========

Source code is hosted at the GnuPG FTP server and its mirrors as listed
at <https://gnupg.org/download/mirrors.html.>  On the primary server
the source tarball and its digital signature are:

 <https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.9.1.tar.bz2>
 <https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.9.1.tar.bz2.sig>

or gzip compressed:

 <https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.9.1.tar.gz>
 <https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.9.1.tar.gz.sig>

In order to check that the version of Libgcrypt you downloaded is an
original and unmodified file please follow the instructions found at
<https://gnupg.org/download/integrity_check.html.>  In short, you may
use one of the following methods:

 - Check the supplied OpenPGP signature.  For example to check the
   signature of the file libgcrypt-1.9.1.tar.bz2 you would use this
   command:

     gpg --verify libgcrypt-1.9.1.tar.bz2.sig libgcrypt-1.9.1.tar.bz2

   This checks whether the signature file matches the source file.
   You should see a message indicating that the signature is good and
   made by one or more of the release signing keys.  Make sure that
   this is a valid key, either by matching the shown fingerprint
   against a trustworthy list of valid release signing keys or by
   checking that the key has been signed by trustworthy other keys.
   See the end of this mail for information on the signing keys.

 - If you are not able to use an existing version of GnuPG, you have
   to verify the SHA-1 checksum.  On Unix systems the command to do
   this is either "sha1sum" or "shasum".  Assuming you downloaded the
   file libgcrypt-1.9.1.tar.bz2, you run the command like this:

     sha1sum libgcrypt-1.9.1.tar.bz2

   and check that the output matches the first line from the
   this list:

a15ce7355b028f28a33428eaa0147154861b29d4  libgcrypt-1.9.1.tar.bz2
f4440ce7893c3cf12f633ad4d3f91c77110a3a40  libgcrypt-1.9.1.tar.gz

   You should also verify that the checksums above are authentic by
   matching them with copies of this announcement.  Those copies can be
   found at other mailing lists, web sites, and search engines.

Since 2001 maintenance and development of GnuPG is done by g10 Code
GmbH and still mostly financed by donations.  Three full-time employed
developers as well as two contractors exclusively work on GnuPG and
closely related software like Libgcrypt, GPGME, and Gpg4win.

We like to thank all the nice people who are helping Libgcrypt, be it
testing, coding, suggesting, auditing, administering the servers,
spreading the word, or answering questions on the mailing lists.

Many thanks to our numerous financial supporters, both corporate and
individuals.  Without you it would not be possible to keep GnuPG and
Libgcrypt in a good and secure shape and to address all the small and
larger requests made by our users.  Thanks.

Thanks to Tavis Ormandy for finding an reporting the bug.

We are sorry for the trouble,

   Your Libgcrypt hackers

#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!

# Description

There is a severe bug in Libgcrypt 1.9.0 released last week ([T4294](/T4294)).

Do not use 1.9.0 but wait for 1.9.1 ([T5259](/T5259)).

The bug was introduced with commit [rCe76617cbab](/rCe76617cbab018dd8f41fd6b4ec6740b5303f7e13) in March 2019 but no version except for 1.9.0 has ever been released with it. The fix included in 1.9.1 is commit [rC512c0c7527](/rC512c0c75276949f13b6373b5c04f7065af750b08)

| [Description](#c0)  David Michael    2021-01-21 19:20:17 UTC  ``` Building for ARM chips without NEON fails.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. armv5tel-gentoo-linux-gnueabi-emerge -v libgcrypt  Actual Results:   /usr/libexec/gcc/armv5tel-gentoo-linux-gnueabi/ld: ./.libs/libgcrypt.so: undefined reference to `_gcry_sha512_transform_armv7_neon' collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status  Expected Results:   It should build and install.  I sent the attached patch upstream to fix the issue.  It would need to be backported.  However, I think the ebuild could probably also add the CPU USE flag to disable building optional NEON support, since this CPU will never use NEON.  The configure summary has the following when the option is not specified.          Try using ARM NEON:        yes  This ebuild change fixes that.  --- dev-libs/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.9.0.ebuild +++ dev-libs/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.9.0.ebuild @@ -12,7 +12,7 @@  LICENSE="LGPL-2.1 MIT"  SLOT="0/20" # subslot = soname major version  KEYWORDS="~alpha amd64 arm arm64 ~hppa ~ia64 ~m68k ~mips ~ppc ~ppc64 ~riscv ~s390 ~sparc x86 ~amd64-linux ~x86-linux ~ppc-macos ~x64-macos ~sparc-solaris ~sparc64-solaris ~x64-solaris ~x86-solaris" -IUSE="doc o-flag-munging static-libs" +IUSE="cpu_flags_arm_neon doc o-flag-munging static-libs"    RDEPEND=">=dev-libs/libgpg-error-1.25[${MULTILIB_USEDEP}]"  DEPEND="${RDEPEND}" @@ -55,6 +55,8 @@  		$([[ ${CHOST} == *86*-darwin* ]] && echo "--disable-asm")  		$([[ ${CHOST} == sparcv9-*-solaris* ]] && echo "--disable-asm")   +		$(use_enable cpu_flags_arm_neon neon-support) +  		GPG_ERROR_CONFIG="${EROOT}/usr/bin/${CHOST}-gpg-error-config"  	)  	ECONF_SOURCE="${S}" econf "${myeconfargs[@]}" \ ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  David Michael    2021-01-21 19:20:33 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 684049](attachment.cgi?id=684049 "neon.patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=684049&action=edit "neon.patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=684049&action=diff "neon.patch")] neon.patch ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Gordon Bos    2021-01-26 12:49:37 UTC  ``` Thanks.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 342 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2788740.1).

### Affected Products and Patch Information

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed below. The product area is shown in the Patch Availability Document column.

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

Hi!

A severe bug was reported yesterday evening against Libgcrypt 1.9.0
which we released last week.  A new version to fix this as weel as a
couple of build problems will be released today.

In the meantime please stop using 1.9.0.

It seems that Fedora 34 and Gentoo are already using 1.9.0 .

Salam-Shalom,

   Werner

## The GNU Privacy Guard

GnuPG is a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard as
defined by [RFC4880](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4880.txt) (also known as *PGP*). GnuPG allows you to encrypt and
sign your data and communications; it features a versatile key management
system, along with access modules for all kinds of public key
directories. GnuPG, also known as *GPG*, is a command line tool with
features for easy integration with other applications. A wealth of
[frontend applications](software/frontends.html) and [libraries](software/libraries.html) are available. GnuPG also
provides support for S/MIME and Secure Shell (ssh).

Since its introduction in 1997, GnuPG is [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) (meaning that
it respects your freedom). It can be freely used, modified and
distributed under the terms of the [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) .

The current version of GnuPG is 2.4.7. See the [download](download/index.html)
page for other maintained versions.

[Gpg4win](https://www.gpg4win.org) is a Windows version of GnuPG featuring a context menu tool, a
crypto manager, and an Outlook plugin to send and receive standard
PGP/MIME mails. The current version of Gpg4win is 4.4.0.

## Reconquer your privacy

> Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy
> because you have nothing to hide is no different from
> saying you don't care about free speech because you have
> nothing to say. – Edward Snowden

Using encryption helps to protect your privacy and the privacy of the
people you communicate with. Encryption makes life difficult for bulk
surveillance systems. GnuPG is one of the tools that Snowden used to
uncover the secrets of the NSA.

Please visit the [Email Self-Defense](https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org) site to learn how and why you
should use GnuPG for your electronic communication.

# Description

libgcrypt 1.9.1 contains a couple of changes to configure wrt. the detection of hardware architecture and capabilities. This detection fails when configuring with --disable-asm. Consequently, build fails because some macros are not defined.

E.g., on my system (macOS, amd64) build fails with the following message:

```
keccak.c:907:23: error: use of undeclared identifier 'HWF_INTEL_FAST_SHLD'
```

Thanks for your report.

It would be good to check if "--disable-asm" is needed at all. If building without "--disable-asm" fails, please report bug.

With --disable-asm, you'll lose all acceleration, for example, on AES. For example, AES-CTR on amd64 without "--disable-asm" is 40 times faster than implementation you get with "--disable-asm" (on Ryzen 5800X).

If building without "--disable-asm" does not work, reverting commit [8d404a629167d67ed56e45de3e65d1e0b7cdeb24](/rC8d404a629167d67ed56e45de3e65d1e0b7cdeb24) will solve the issue. But before you do that, please, report your build issue.

Building without "--disable-asm" works without any issues.

[@jukivili](/p/jukivili/) Thanks for the reply! We've reverted that commit downstream in Gentoo as a temporary workaround, as due to some complications, our release systems needed to build without asm (for now) to ensure portability. Rest assured, this is not the default, and is discouraged for regular users.

I'll attach my build.log from a Gentoo Linux system which shows the failure. I did mock up a draft patch to guard two defines (one in keccak.c, the other in rndjent.c) but I wasn't confident enough to submit in case I misunderstood your intentions.

Unfortunately, building without "--disable-asm" does not work if building a universal package under MacPorts (e.g. 32bit and 64bit x86 or 64bit x86 and arm64).

See: <https://trac.macports.org/ticket/62198>
