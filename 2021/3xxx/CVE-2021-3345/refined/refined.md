  "CVE-2021-3345": {
    "description": "A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in libgcrypt 1.9.0 due to an incorrect assumption in the block buffer management code. Just decrypting some data can overflow a heap buffer with attacker-controlled data, no verification or signature is validated before the vulnerability occurs.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Incorrect assumption in the block buffer management code.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap buffer overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "A heap buffer overflow can occur during decryption with attacker-controlled data.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Decrypting attacker-controlled data"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply specially crafted data to be decrypted by a vulnerable libgcrypt version.",
        "additional_information": "The vulnerability can be triggered without any authentication and no verification/signature check is done before the overflow. The issue is located in hash functions introduced in version 1.9.0.  This vulnerability was fixed in libgcrypt version 1.9.1. The vulnerability is present in  `libgcrypt 1.9.0` only."
