Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the changes made in the commit `67093c8`, specifically focusing on the `UserController.class.php` file:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The commit addresses an issue related to setting cookies, specifically the `cookie_token`. The original code used the `cookie()` function which, based on the comments, had its expiration controlled server-side, regardless of the set cookie expiration. The vulnerability was the lack of proper `samesite` attribute for the cookie, which could make the application vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Missing `samesite` attribute:** The original code did not set the `samesite` attribute for the `cookie_token`. Without the `samesite` attribute set to `Strict`, the application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Inconsistent cookie handling:** The code initially used `cookie()` function, which does not have the 'samesite' attribute. The fix uses `setcookie()` with  `samesite` set to `Strict` when PHP version is >= 7.3.0, but uses `cookie()` when PHP version is less than 7.3.0.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **CSRF attacks:** An attacker could potentially exploit the missing `samesite` attribute to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in user by tricking them into submitting requests from a malicious website or email, for example through malicious forms, images and script injections.
- **Session hijacking:** If CSRF is successful, an attacker could potentially hijack a user's session.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Cross-site requests:**  An attacker hosts a malicious website or crafts a malicious email containing a link or form that targets the vulnerable application. If a user with an active session clicks the link or submits the form, the attacker can make unauthorized requests on their behalf without the user's knowledge.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to create a malicious website or email:** The attacker must be able to create and host a malicious webpage or send malicious emails that a logged-in user would potentially interact with.
- **Target user interaction:** The attacker needs a logged-in user to interact with the malicious content.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable application:** The attacker needs to understand the application to craft requests that would perform an unauthorized action, for example, modify the application state.

**Changes in the commit:**

- The commit introduces conditional logic based on the PHP version. For PHP versions 7.3.0 and above, it uses `setcookie()` to set the cookie and  `samesite` attribute set to `Strict` to protect against CSRF attacks. For older PHP version, the previous `cookie()` function is used, and remains vulnerable.
- The cookie expiration is increased from 90 days to 180 days, which does not appear to be related to security.
- `path` attribute set to '/' so the cookie is available to all subfolders in the application

**Additional details:**
- The original code comment "此处由服务端控制token是否过期，所以cookies过期时间设置多久都无所谓" (translated: "Here the server controls whether the token expires, so it doesn't matter how long the cookie expiration time is set") indicates a misunderstanding of how cookies work and the implications of cookie expiration, as client-side cookie expiration is used to prevent replay attacks.
- The use of `httponly` flag is present in the original code and remains in the fix, providing protection against XSS attacks.
