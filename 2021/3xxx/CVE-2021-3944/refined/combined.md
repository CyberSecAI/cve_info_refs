This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Prevented auto-login from direct email confirmation actions

```
Was done for convenience but could potentially be exploited by an
attacker using signing up via one of these routes, then forwarding
an email confirmation to another user so they unknowingly utilise
an account someone else controls.

Tweaks the flow of confirming email, and the user invite flow.

For [#3050](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/issues/3050)
