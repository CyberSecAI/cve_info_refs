Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-3561:

**Root Cause:**
- A global buffer overflow exists in the `read_objects` function within the `fig2dev/read.c` file. This vulnerability is within the `transfig` utility which is used for converting FIG files created by `xfig` to other formats.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Global buffer overflow:** The vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow, where writing beyond the allocated memory space leads to memory corruption.
- **Out-of-bounds read**: The Debian Security Advisory also mentions out-of-bounds reads as a vulnerability present in `fig2dev`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory corruption:** The buffer overflow can lead to memory corruption, potentially causing unpredictable behavior or system instability.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to a crash, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Unspecified Impact:** The Debian advisory suggests exploitation could result in unspecified impact beyond DoS.
- The Red Hat Bugzilla entry mentions that "in some cases memory corruption" can occur, further expanding on the potential impact of the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Input:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted FIG file to the `fig2dev` utility.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide input:** An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted FIG file as input to the `transfig` utility which calls `fig2dev`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content indicates that patches have been applied upstream to address the issue.
- Updates have been released by Fedora for Fedora 33 and Fedora 34 to mitigate this vulnerability in the `transfig` package.
- Debian also released a security update (DLA-2778-1) for the `fig2dev` package addressing this and other vulnerabilities.
- The Red Hat Bugzilla entry confirms that this is a global buffer overflow in `fig2dev/read.c`.
- The Red Hat bug report indicates that the highest threat from the vulnerability is to integrity as well as system availability.
