Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-3376:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a session validation weakness in the Profile function of Cuppa CMS. Specifically, the application does not properly validate user privileges when processing POST requests to modify user profiles.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Privilege Validation:** The application does not properly check the user's privileges before updating profile information, allowing low-privilege users to escalate their rights.
- **Insecure Parameter Handling:** The `user_group_id_field` parameter can be manipulated in a POST request to change a user's group ID, leading to privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with a low-privilege account can escalate their privileges to Super Admin.
- **Full Control of the CMS:** By gaining Super Admin access, the attacker can gain full control over the Cuppa CMS system, potentially leading to data breaches, system manipulation, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.
- **HTTP POST Request Manipulation:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious HTTP POST request to the profile update function. The attacker modifies the `user_group_id_field` parameter in the POST request and sets the value to "1" (or an ID associated with a higher privilege group).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid, low-privilege account on the Cuppa CMS.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable system.
- **Knowledge of the `user_group_id_field` parameter:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable parameter to exploit the vulnerability successfully.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code is in the Profile function of Cuppa CMS versions before 31 Jan 2021.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated user sending a crafted POST request containing the vulnerable parameter and setting it to "1".
- After successfully changing the `user_group_id_field`, the attacker can re-login to obtain Super Admin privileges.
- The CVSS score is 8.8, with a high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability.
