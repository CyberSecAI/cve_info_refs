The provided content relates to CVE-2021-3799.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a missing or incorrect `X-Frame-Options` header in the admin pages of the Grav plugin. This allows the potential for clickjacking attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The weakness is the incorrect `X-Frame-Options` header, which was set to `NONE` instead of `DENY`. This exposes the admin pages to clickjacking attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful clickjacking attack could allow an attacker to trick a user into performing unintended actions on the Grav admin panel. This could lead to unauthorized changes or information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a clickjacking attack, where an attacker embeds the vulnerable admin pages within a malicious page (using `<iframe>`, etc).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage that includes the vulnerable Grav admin page within an iframe. The victim needs to be logged into the Grav admin panel and visit the malicious webpage.
