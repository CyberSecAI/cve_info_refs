- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An OS command argument injection vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS command argument injection (CWE-88). An attacker can inject malicious arguments into OS commands executed by the web interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated administrator can read any arbitrary file from the file system. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive configuration data, credentials, or other files stored on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through the PAN-OS web interface, accessible over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator with access to the PAN-OS web interface.
