  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-3116",
    "description": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in proxy.py version 2.3.0, where basic authentication could be bypassed due to an incorrect conditional logic in the authentication check.",
    "affected_component": "Basic authentication in proxy.py",
    "root_cause": "Incorrect use of `and` operators in the authentication logic. The code checks multiple conditions to validate the 'Proxy-Authorization' header, but due to incorrect boolean logic, a valid header with any credentials could bypass the authentication checks.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "weakness": "Incorrect implementation of conditional logic. Vulnerable code located in proxy/http/proxy/auth.py",
      "impact": "Bypass of proxy authentication, allowing unauthorized access to the proxy server.",
        "attack_vectors": "Any client sending a proxy request with a 'Proxy-Authorization' header, regardless of the correctness of the provided credentials, can bypass the authentication. This includes browsers, command-line tools like curl, or any software that can use HTTP proxies.",
       "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the proxy server. No user interaction or special position is required for exploitation."
    },
     "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was reported and fixed quickly by the project maintainers in version 2.3.1. The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the bypass, by showing that sending an arbitrary username/password in the basic authentication string allows the request to go through even if the provided credentials do not match the ones expected."
