The provided content is related to CVE-2021-3435.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Information leakage in the `le_ecred_conn_req()` function within the L2CAP (Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol) layer of the Zephyr RTOS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Information leakage. The specific nature of the leakage is not detailed, but it allows an attacker to potentially gain sensitive information. The associated CWE is CWE-908 which means use of uninitialized resource.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Low confidentiality impact - an attacker can gain access to potentially sensitive information. There is no integrity or availability impact, according to the CVSS score.

**Attack vectors:**
Local. The attacker needs to be local to the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be in a position to interact with the vulnerable Zephyr device locally. No privileges or user interaction is required.
