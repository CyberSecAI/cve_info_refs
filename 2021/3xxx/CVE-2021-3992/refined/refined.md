Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the changes related to a potential vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The commit `ff9acab0fc81f0e9490462739ef15fe4ab028ea5` addresses a permission handling issue in the invoice screen.  Specifically, the changes in `src/Repository/CustomerRepository.php` and `src/Repository/Query/CustomerFormTypeQuery.php` reveal that a user could potentially manipulate the customer query to access customer data they should not have access to. The commit adds a check `isAllowCustomerPreselect()` to determine if preselection of a customer is allowed which would limit access to customers outside the teams of the current user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) or Parameter Manipulation**: The original code in `src/Repository/CustomerRepository.php` allowed a user to potentially manipulate the query (by directly injecting customer IDs) to bypass access restrictions. This is because the `CustomerFormTypeQuery` allowed to preselect customer IDs without proper checks if the user had team access to these customers.
- **Insufficient Access Control**: The vulnerability stemmed from the lack of strict enforcement of team-based access control within the customer selection process during invoice creation or preview.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Data Access**: An attacker could potentially gain access to customer data (including personally identifiable information) that they were not authorized to see.
- **Information Disclosure**:  Sensitive information related to customers could be exposed to unauthorized users.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Manipulated Request Parameters**: An attacker could modify the request parameters during invoice creation or preview, specifically targeting customer IDs.
- **Bypassing UI Restrictions**: By crafting a malicious request, the attacker could bypass the intended UI restrictions and directly query for customers outside their permitted scope.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User**: The attacker would need to be a registered user of the system.
- **Knowledge of System Internals**: An understanding of how the invoice system handles customer queries would be required for the attacker to successfully exploit this vulnerability.
- **Basic Web Skills**: The attacker would need the capability to manipulate HTTP requests and parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

- The commit includes changes in `src/Voter/CustomerVoter.php`, which adds a more strict access check for customer objects that enforces team access.
- The changes to `src/Controller/InvoiceController.php` remove the permission check `is_granted('create_invoice')` before a preview is rendered. The permission check now happens before the invoice model is created. The same applies to the create invoice action.

In summary, the commit addresses a vulnerability where an authenticated user could gain access to customer data they were not authorized to see by manipulating the customer query within the invoice creation or preview process.
