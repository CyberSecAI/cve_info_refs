Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3521:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The content explicitly mentions "Fixes [CVE-2021-3521](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pr6x-p264-jrpq "CVE-2021-3521")" in the commit message, and the description aligns with the vulnerability as it relates to RPM not validating subkey binding signatures.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

*   The root cause is the lack of validation of subkey binding signatures in RPM's PGP public key processing.  OpenPGP subkeys are supposed to be associated with a primary key using a "binding signature," but RPM did not enforce this requirement during import or validation.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

*   **Missing Validation:** RPM failed to check for the presence and validity of binding signatures that link subkeys to their primary keys. This is a violation of the OpenPGP specification.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**

*   **Data Integrity Compromise:** By bypassing subkey binding signature validation, an attacker could introduce malicious subkeys into a seemingly trusted public key. This could lead to RPM trusting a malicious signature. The attacker could then potentially sign and distribute malicious RPM packages.
*   **Social Engineering Attack Vector:** An attacker could trick a user or system administrator into installing a modified public key, thereby leading to the installation of untrusted packages.
*   **Compromised RPM Repository:** An attacker who compromises an RPM repository could insert a modified key with a malicious subkey.

**5. Attack Vectors**

*   **Compromised RPM Repository:** An attacker compromises an RPM repository and replaces a legitimate public key with a tampered one containing a malicious subkey.
*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker convinces a system administrator to install a manipulated public key containing a malicious subkey.
*  **Compromised key export process:** A user could export a key using a tool that does not validate subkey binding signatures, thus creating a vulnerable key.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   An attacker would need to have the ability to either:
    *   Compromise a trusted RPM repository.
    *   Socially engineer a user into installing a manipulated public key.
    * Have control over the process of exporting keys to inject a malicious subkey.

**7. Additional Technical Details**
* The vulnerability is in `rpmio/rpmpgp.c`, specifically in the parsing of PGP public keys.
* The fix involves validating subkey binding signatures by checking `sigtype` against `PGPSIGTYPE_SUBKEY_BINDING` and creating hash of primary key and subkey for validation.
* The fix also stores the raw packets internally for access when validating ordering and accessing the data.
* Test cases added with keys where import previously would succeed, but now fail.
*   The patch refactors `pgpDigParams` construction to a helper function to reduce code duplication.
*   The patch includes new tests to check for correct subkey binding signature enforcement.
*   The issue occurs because the signature type information was not enforced, leading to a signature of a public key being accepted as a signature of a document.

**8. References**

*   The patch and fix can be found in commit `bd36c5d` of the rpm repository.
*   The vulnerability is tracked as [CVE-2021-3521](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3521) and  [GHSA-pr6x-p264-jrpq](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pr6x-p264-jrpq)
