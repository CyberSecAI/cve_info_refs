{
  "CVE-2021-3679": {
    "description": "A flaw in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality could allow a privileged local user (with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) to cause a denial of service (resource starvation).",
    "root_cause": "The rb_per_cpu_empty() function in the Linux kernel tracing module has a bug where it misinterprets the condition for an empty ring buffer leading to a deadloop.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
        "Denial of service due to resource starvation",
        "Infinite looping",
        "Incorrect conditional evaluation in rb_per_cpu_empty()"
      ],
    "impact": "A privileged local user can cause a denial of service (resource starvation) on the system. The victim process (that is trapped) will always be in running state, drain a lot of power and cannot be killed by any UNIX signal (including SIGKILL)",
    "attack_vector": "A local user with sufficient privileges to control tracefs (like root or has CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) can trigger the vulnerability through a crafted bash script.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a privileged local user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability or root access to control tracefs."
