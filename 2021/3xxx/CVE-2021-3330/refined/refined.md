- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sorting of forged IEEE 802.15.4 fragment lists, specifically when a FRAG1 fragment is missing, leading to a cyclic list and subsequent out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    -  The fragment reassembly logic assumes the presence of a FRAG1 fragment.
    - The sorting logic doesn't properly handle the case where the first fragment has a large offset, causing a cyclic linked-list.
    - Integer underflow in fragment's size field due to repeated header removal.
    - Out-of-bounds `memmove` operation due to the corrupted size, leading to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Corruption of kernel data structures.
    - Potential for remote arbitrary code execution during a context switch.
    - At minimum, a crash inside the network stack, leading to Denial of Service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**: Sending forged IEEE 802.15.4 fragment lists that omit the FRAG1 fragment and have a large offset as the first fragment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be within the adjacent network to send crafted packets. No specific user interaction is required.
