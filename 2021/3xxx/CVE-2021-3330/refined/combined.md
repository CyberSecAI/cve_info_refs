# RCE/DOS: Linked-list corruption leading to large out-of-bounds write while sorting for forged fragment list in Zephyr

## Package

zephyr
(west)

## Affected versions

>=2.4.0

## Patched versions

2.5.0

## Description

# 1. Improper IEEE 802.15.4 Fragment Reconstruction Sorting For Forged Fragments

* Bug Description: The fragment reassembly logic improperly sorts forged fragment lists that miss a FRAG1 fragment, leading to a network buffer out of bounds write.
* Bug Result: An attacker can forge a fragment list that initially creates a cyclic fragment list, which leads to an integer underflow followed by a large out-of-bounds copy of a network buffer
* Bug Impact: Large out-of-bounds write which leads to a corruption of kernel data structures. This is likely exploitable for remote arbitrary code execution during a context switch, and at least leads to a crash inside the network stack (DoS).

## Bug Details

* Affected code: Fragment reassembly logic, starting in subsys/net/l2/ieee802154/ieee802154\_fragment.c

High-Level reasoning for bug occurrence:

1. The IEEE 802.15.4 fragment reassembly logic assumes a sender to send properly formatted fragments, which includes a FRAG1 fragment
2. When all required fragments are collected, the fragments are sorted by its fragment\_offset to form the full data packet
3. Building on the assumption of a FRAG1 fragment being present, the sorting logic implicitly assumes that during sorting, the first fragment never needs to be moved during sorting
4. By invalidating this assumption and providing a fragment with a large fragment offset as the first fragment, an attacker can trick the sorting logic into trying to insert a fragment in front of the first fragment, corrupting the list and leading to a cyclic list where a NULL-terminated singly-linked list is expected
5. When the supposed-to-be singly linked list is then iterated, header removal functions are repeatedly applied to the same fragments, leading to an integer overflow in the fragment's size field. This in turn causes a large out-of-bounds memmove operation, corrupting the data section, including important kernel structures.

Conceptual Example:

Consider the following fragment list to be sorted via fragment\_reconstruct\_packet (

[zephyr/subsys/net/l2/ieee802154/ieee802154\_fragment.c](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/d969aced6dd9ef7834d21ff8131aa561e71cc42d/subsys/net/l2/ieee802154/ieee802154_fragment.c#L450)

|  | static inline void fragment\_reconstruct\_packet(struct net\_pkt \*pkt) |
| --- | --- |

, also pasted as code snippets below)
```
==== within reassemble ====
Packet @0x20108c04
	frag @0x201096d0 (6 bytes @0x2010c0e7): b'e02404ff4004'

	frag @0x20109730 (7 bytes @0x2010c2e7): b'e70180ff047f84'

	frag @0x20109898 (7 bytes @0x2010ca67): b'e7ff7fff049a84'

```

With the first byte indicating the fragment type (all of them being FRAG\_N fragments as they are starting with a 0xe\_ byte) fifth byte representing the fragment offset field inside the ieee802.15.4 fragment, this leads to the following iniatial list of fragments with given weights:

frag(0x40) -> frag(0x04) -> frag(0x04) -> frag(0x04) -> frag(0x04) -> frag(0x1b)

1. The logic will iterate starting from the first item

   prev = NULL, curr=frag(0x40), next=frag(0x04)
2. It will assign prev, as !prev holds, resulting in

   prev = frag(0x40), curr=frag(0x04), next=frag(0x04)
3. This will enter fragment\_move\_back(pkt, frag(0x04), frag(0x40)), but will immediately return as stop==pkt->buffer, resulting in

   prev = frag(0x04), curr=frag(0x04), next=frag(0x04)
4. This will enter fragment\_move\_back(pkt, frag(0x04), frag(0x04) again. This time, it will compare frag(0x04) to pkt->buffer, which is frag(0x40). This leads to the assignment `frag(0x04)->frags = pkt->buffer`. But as prev is NULL within fragment\_move\_back, pkt->buffer->frags remains the same. This creates the following circular list:

   frag(0x40) -> frag(0x04) -> frag(0x04)

## Proposed Fix

The fragmentation logic has to explicitly handle the case in which no FRAG1 fragment is present. This check could be performed just before performing the fragment reassembly logic:

Link:

[zephyr/subsys/net/l2/ieee802154/ieee802154\_fragment.c](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/d969aced6dd9ef7834d21ff8131aa561e71cc42d/subsys/net/l2/ieee802154/ieee802154_fragment.c#L522)

|  | fragment\_reconstruct\_packet(pkt); |
| --- | --- |

If the goal is to be more forgiving during the parsing, the sorting logic could be adapted to cater for the case where the first element is not already sorted into the list correctly and allow the pkt->buffer (which is the pointer to the first net\_buf fragment) reference to be updated.
