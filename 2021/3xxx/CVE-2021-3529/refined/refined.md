Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3529:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- **Integrity:** Attackers can modify the content of the page or user actions.
- **System Availability:** Attackers might disrupt normal system operations, potentially leading to a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** The primary attack vector is a crafted URL containing a malicious JavaScript payload within the parameter's value.
- The attacker needs to trick the victim into clicking the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or modify URLs used by the Noobaa application.
- The attacker needs to be able to induce a user to visit the crafted URL.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the noobaa-core component of openshift-container-storage-4.
- The vulnerability is fixed in noobaa version 5.7.0.
- The injected URL parameter is echoed unmodified into the HTML response.
