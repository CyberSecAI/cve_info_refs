# yith-giftdrop

A tool for checking as well as exploiting CVE-2021-3120, Arbitrary File Upload vulnerability in YITH WooCommerce Gift Cards Premium version 3.3.0 and below.

## A Word of Warning

Please do not run this tool against systems that you do not have permissions to test. Doing so is illegal and you could face prosecution despite your best intentions. If you are an IT/cyber security enthusiast and you are curious about how this tool works, I recommend that you setup your own lab environment for testing this tool out.

## Vulnerability Description

A critical vulnerability (CVSSv3 9.8) exists in the WordPress plugin "YITH WooCommerce Gift Cards Premium" version 3.3.0 and below, which allows an attacker to upload arbitary files to the server and therefore achieve remote code execution on the server operating system in the security context of the web server.

The plugin allows gift card products to be added to the site (powered by the WordPress WooCommerce plugin) and offers an optional feature that let customers purchase gift cards with custom designs by upload a picture of their choice when placing the gift card product in the cart. The file is submitted via the "ywgc-upload-picture" file parameter of the POST request however the server does not perform any sanity checks before processing the request, and stores the file in a predictable location on the server, with the client-specified file name as well as file extension. Code execution can be easily achieved by uploading a PHP file with .php extension and then requesting the file at the uploaded location.

It is also worth noting that the vulnerability is exploitable regardless of whether the custom gift card design feature is enabled or not. The only condition required to exploit this vulnerability is the ability to add a gift card to the shopping cart.

## Vulnerability Details

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Vulnerability Name | Arbitrary File Upload Leading to Remote Code Execution |
| CVE | CVE-2021-3120 |
| CVSS Vector | CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H |
| CVSS Score | 9.8 (Critical) |
| Vendor | YITH |
| Product Affected | YITH WooCommerce Gift Cards Premium |
| Product Page | <https://yithemes.com/themes/plugins/yith-woocommerce-gift-cards/> |
| Versions Affected | Version 3.3.0 and below |
| Fixed Version | v3.3.1 |

Version 3.1.5 and version 3.3.0 were used for testing and were found to be vulnerable. Lab environment was running WordPress 5.6 and WooCommerce 4.8.0.

## About This Tool

This tool is written to automate the discovery of WordPress sites that may be affected by this issue. It does so by performing a version enumeration using information contained in the readme.txt file which is included with the plugin by default.

In addition, it has a capability to perform a proof of concept test by uploading a simple php script with a randomly generated name. The script contains a simple echo command, which when requested is used to confirm code execution. As the uploaded file will remain on the server, the randomly generated file name will help reduce the chance of the file being requested by others and also the script would not cause any harm to the server.

The tool can also be used to exploit this vulnerability. The default attack is to upload a simple PHP web shell. This can be used to execute further OS commands, including reverse shells. For more "interesting" scenarios you can specify a custom payload as well as custom file names to bypass further server-side restrictions.

## Installation

Simply clone the repository or download the yith-giftdrop.py file to run.

## Usage

To perform vulnerability test via version enumeration, specify the url of the gift card product (-u) and enumeration mode (-e). This is purely information gathering and does not attempt any file upload operations.

```
$ ./yith-giftdrop.py -u http://192.168.0.1:8000/product/gift-card/ -e
Info: Found plugin via readme.txt
Info: Found version 3.1.5 - VULNERABLE! Please upgrade to v3.3.1 or above.

```

To perform a proof of concept, use the -c option. This will leave a PHP file on the server so a warning will be displayed to inform you of this and the program will exit at this point. You will need to add the -a or --accept flag to confirm that you understood this and want to continue.

```
$ ./yith-giftdrop.py -u http://192.168.0.1:8000/product/gift-card/ -c -a
Info: Found plugin via readme.txt
Info: Found version 3.1.5 - VULNERABLE! Please upgrade to v3.3.1 or above.
Info: Preparing for upload...
Info: Uploaded file to: http://192.168.0.1:8000/wp-content/uploads/yith-gift-cards/2021/1/7eb0273842554d6e9db937be07faf270.php
Info: Received expected response at payload url. CODE EXECUTION confirmed!

```

By default the tool will attempt to upload a basic web shell. Again you will need to add the -a or accept flag to confirm you want to proceed.

```
$ ./yith-giftdrop.py -u http://192.168.0.1:8000/product/gift-card/ -a
Info: Found plugin via readme.txt
Info: Found version 3.1.5 - VULNERABLE! Please upgrade to v3.3.1 or above.
Info: Preparing for upload...

Info: Default payload (OS Command Execution) is used. Try below to obtain server hostname:
Info:     curl http://192.168.0.1:8000/wp-content/uploads/yith-gift-cards/2021/1/1ec442e859f44733b3e5271116e682ae.php?cmd=hostname

uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)

```

For other uses of the tool, including the use of a custom payload and file name, see the help screen.

```
$ ./yith-giftdrop.py -h
usage: yith-giftdrop.py [-h] [-e] [-c] -u URL [-p PAYLOAD] [-f FILE] [-n NAME] [-a]

### Gift cards: the number one marketing tool to increase your shop sales

Gift cards — aka gift certificates — have always been the best option whenever we have to choose a gift for a friend or workmate, as they guarantee flexibility and are also easy to use. They just make things easier both for those who buy them and for those who receive one.

According to a report by Allied Market Research, the gift card turnover (which has been constantly growing in the past decade) will soon record a 14% upsurge and go from 5.7 billion in 2020 to 16 billion by 2028. By 2030, **online sales of gift cards will reach a value of 1.1 trillion dollars**. That is why 98% of e-commerce stores are already selling gift cards: it is a powerful marketing tool to increase sales — especially during the holiday season — and loyalize customers over time.

If you are running an online shop and looking for the easiest way to start selling gift cards, **YITH WooCommerce Gift Cards** will be your best ally and mark a turning point: our plugin is the best and most complete solution available online. Thanks to it, you will be able to create gift cards in a few minutes and your customers will be able to customize them, send them by email, or print them at home.

## Create digital gift cards to sell in your shop and send by email

Gift cards are quick, simple, and flexible: you can buy one in just a few clicks and email it in real time to the recipient.

Configuring a gift card is a piece of cake: create the “gift card” product, set the amount ($25, $50, $100, etc.), and decide if customers can enter their own custom amount, then upload a catchy image and you’re all set! In less than 3 minutes, you can start selling gift cards in your shop.

## Create printable gift cards to ship to your customers

Do you sell physical printable gift cards in your physical shop and would like to replicate this user experience in your online store too? You can easily sell non-digital gift cards and, after the order is completed, ship it to the customer.

## Create several gift codes for the same amount with just one click

Do you want to quickly share 10 gift card codes, each with a $50 credit, without asking your customers to manually buy them from your shop and without generating new orders? With the new bulk option, you can now create multiple gift codes for the same amount in the plugin panel with just two clicks.

 ![Bulk generate gift card codes](https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/003.Create-Gift-Card-codes-bulk-WooCommerce-1024x610.jpg)![Import and export gift cards in CSV](https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/004.Import-Export-WooCommerce-Gift-Card-CSV-1024x629.jpg)
## Import and export gift cards into a CSV file

To fulfil one of the most requested features, we have recently added the option to import and export gift cards into a CSV file right from the plugin.

## Easily migrate from Smart Coupons to YITH Gift Cards

Thanks to the built-in option, you can easily remove Smart Coupons and convert the Store Credit / Gift Certificate coupons on your site into gift cards.

 ![Convert smart coupons into gift cards](https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/005.Convert-Smart-Coupons-WooCommerce-Gift-Card-1024x544.jpg)![User-friendly interface](https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/006.Userfriendly-Inteface-WooCommerce-Gift-Card-1024x927.jpg)
## Modern and minimal design that works with every theme

We update the plugin design on a regular basis to make sure that its look is always modern and can fit every WordPress theme.

Thanks to the new interface, buying and customizing a gift card from your shop will be child’s play, even for customers that are not tech-savvy. They will simply have to choose the gift card amount, add a custom message, and enter the recipient’s email address.

## Create themed image galleries to customize your gift cards

An exclusive feature of our plugin and that we added by looking at Amazon: you can create unlimited image categories to customize your gift cards. For example, you can add themed images for Christmas and birthdays, or about friendship and family, and offer your customers a wide selection to set up the gift cards. An emotional image or a witty illustration can add that special touch that makes a difference for the person who receives the gift.

 ![Customize image gallery](https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/007.Images-Gallery-Customize-WooCommerce-Gift-Card-1024x718.jpg)
## Let your users customize the gift cards with their own pictures or images

Sometimes, a gift card may look like an impersonal last-minute option to just spare the trouble of looking for the ideal gift. This is why it is key to let your users customize their gift cards with their own special pictures or images: market research shows that 68% of users feel frustrated if they cannot enter a custom message or upload their own images when purchasing a gift card. If you can get rid of this frustration, you will be able to offer a positive buying experience and increase sales of gift cards in your store.

## Set the gift card amounts or let customers enter a custom one

You can create gift cards with fixed amounts or configure several pre-set amounts and let your customers choose the one they prefer. Or for even greater flexibility, you can show an input field where they can enter a custom amount — you can anyway set a minimum amount to enter for the gift card.

 ![Custom or fixed amount](https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/009.Custom-Amount-WooCommerce-Gift-Card-1024x671.jpg)![Gift card delivery date](https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/010.Set-Delivery-Date-WooCommerce-Gift-Card-1024x904.jpg)
## Let customers choose when the gift card will be sent to the recipient’s email address

It’s important to be able to choose when the gift card is delivered: thanks to the date and time picker, you can buy the gift card well ahead of time (up to three months in advance) and make sure it is delivered on your friend’s birthday or on Christmas Eve. But obviously, if it’s a last-minute gift, they can always take advantage of immediate delivery 😉

## Let your customers send a virtual version of the gift card or download a PDF version

Do your customers want to print their gift cards at home? No problem at all. They can get it as a PDF file by email, print it easily at home, and then deliver it personally to the recipient.

 ![Printable gift cards](https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/011.Printable-Gift-Card-WooCommerce-Gift-Card-958x1024.jpg)![Gift this product option](https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/012.Gift-Product-WooCommerce-Gift-Card-1024x772.jpg) Hot
## Let customers buy a gift card for a specific product of your shop

Another exclusive feature of our plugin: you can show a call to action in your product pages to push users to send a gift card that will be automatically generated for the same amount as a specific product’s price and that will recommend that product to the recipient. This is a nice way to recommend a product that you think your loved one would like. You will find an additional option in the plugin that allows the sender to also include shipping costs for the recommended product.

## Insert a QR code into the gift card

Decide if you want to insert a QR code into the gift card. By scanning the code with a smartphone, the recipient will be redirected to the Shop page of your site and the gift card code will be automatically applied to the cart.

 ![Show QR code on gift card](https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/013.Show-QR-Code-WooCommerce-Gift-Card-1024x975.jpg)Hot
## Notify the sender when the gift card is delivered and when it is used in your shop

Senders often have many doubts about the gift cards: has the recipient received it? Was the delivery successful? Did the recipient appreciate the thought? To provide a positive experience for your customers, you can set up a delivery notification (to confirm to the sender that the gift card was sent correctly) and an additional notification to let them know that the gift card was used on a purchase in your shop.

 ![Manage and edit gift cards from dashboard](https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/015.Manage-Edit-Gift-Cards-WooCommerce-Gift-Card-1024x752.jpg)
## Monitor and manage the gift cards sold on your shop through the dedicated dashboard: disable gift cards, check the orders they were used on, view the used and remaining balance, etc.

Thanks to the dedicated table, you can easily monitor and manage all the gift card codes purchased in your shop. For each gift card, you can view the redeemed credit, the order in which it was used, and the remaining balance. You can also change the current balance and the expiration date on the gift card, or disable it altogether.

## Configure the options for the Cart and Checkout pages in an advanced way

Choose where to display the gift card code form on the Cart and Checkout pages, customize the design, and allow your customers to review and edit the delivery information directly on the Cart page. From version 3.0, users can enter the gift card code into WooCommerce’s default coupon form, avoiding a duplicate input field and improving page design and usability.

 ![Gift card box in cart](https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/016.Gift-Card-Field-Cart-Checkout-WooCommerce-Gift-Card-1024x768.jpg)![Check gift card balance](https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/017.Check-Gift-Card-Balance-WooCommerce-Gift-Card-1024x772.jpg)
## Create a page where your customers can check the available balance of their gift cards

Using the shortcode found in the documentation, you can insert a form into any page of your shop to allow customers to check the remaining balance of a gift card by entering the code in the dedicated field — a feature they will certainly find useful.

## Create a page where your staff can update the remaining balance of a gift card

A handy feature to manage gift cards used in your physical store: thanks to the dedicated shortcode, you can create a page where the remaining balance of any gift card can be updated. This way, when a gift card is used to purchase in your physical store, you can just enter the code and amount to be deducted to quickly update its balance — no need to manually edit the gift card on the backend!

   Lots of problems, old design and little control functionalityLately I have had a terrible experience using the module, the PDF voucher has a terrible design on 2!!! A4 pages, why not make more flexible control of PDF creation?

    Compatibility with VPML is terrible, when translating lines, the texts in the PDF file are not translated.

    When ordering a gift card, after confirming the order, a second gift card is generated with a different code, for the same order.

    The module has become simply terrible, I filed complaints with tech support, but so far there is no solution to the problem, which is also very disappointing

   Smart choice for gift card managementGreat solution to add gift cards to online stores, it comes with great customization options for cards and amounts. Customers love the flexibility of it, and it’s a fantastic way to boost sales. My clients are very happy I recommended this plugin to them.

   Other plugins from you YITH are great!Other plugins from you YITH are great!

    But this one has a lot of bugs.

    Suggestions for improvement:
    1. UX - product page = not well compatible with very popular Flatsome theme
    Form for digital vouchers more customisable. More modern look. More compatibility.

    2. more control over the gift card.
    e.g.: Preview in the shop does not have to be the same as the file that is sent.
    or the product image should not appear in the voucher variants at the same time.

    3. emails
    #) The email does not arrive at Gmail. Or not in iCloud either. But it does with self-hosting. Other shop emails arrive.
    #) PDF where voucher is sent contains a faulty image. Very poor design.

    4. outdated elements
    Some functions are very outdated. For example the date picker.

    5. i would be willing to pay more and get a better plugin in return.

    If nothing improves here before the Christmas season, we will inevitably have to look for another plugin eco-system.

  Hi there,
   thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts with us!

   We're sorry to hear that our plugin doesn't meet your expectations. We want to clarify that the points you have highlighted are not bugs, but rather a different way of conceiving the plugin UX. We will add your feedback to the list of requests from our users.

   RecommendedI think this is the best gift card plugin I have ever used. It has the best features like "gift this product". The interface is quite easy to use, so I'm glad I use this plugin on my store!

* Amount and Balance

#### Does the buyer have the option to anonymously purchase a gift card for someone? Or will the recipient always know who sent it?

The person buying the gift card can leave the sender's name empty in the form. This way, the recipient will not know who sent the gift card.

#### Can a customer print out or bring in a digital copy of the gift card to use in a physical store?

Yes, he can. To make sure that the card balance can be updated, your physical store has to be synced with your WooCommerce store where the gift card has been purchased. Alternatively, you can connect to your WooCommerce and decrease the gift card balance manually based on the discount you apply in the physical store. To make this process easier, you can also create a custom page with [this shortcode](https://docs.yithemes.com/yith-woocommerce-gift-cards/premium-version-guide/shortcodes/redeem-gift-card/) to quickly update the gift card balance.

#### Is there a way to customize the gift card code?

Yes, of course, you can customize the pattern of the gift card code as shown [here](https://docs.yithemes.com/yith-woocommerce-gift-cards/free-version-guide/general-options/), or edit the gift card code manually.

#### Does the plugin offer the capability for the buyer to print the gift card?

You can enable an option to attach the Gift card code to the email as a PDF document. The users will be able to print this document.

#### Can the user redeem part of their voucher in one purchase and the remainder at another time?

Yes, that is possible, if there is balance left the user can use it in a next purchase and also check their balance.

#### Is it possible to have the customized image shown on the customer's order, rather than the featured image?

Yes, the featured image can be changed both by the administrator, during the creation of the “gift card” product, and by the user, during the purchase. You can read more about the gift card design [here](https://docs.yithemes.com/yith-woocommerce-gift-cards/premium-version-guide/style/).

#### How do you not charge tax for a gift card?

You can edit it in the backend, go to Products -> select product -> General -> Tax status -> select none.

#### How can customers check the balance of their gift cards?

Users can keep track of the gift cards they own from their My account through the specific Gift Cards section. You can also use the shortcode provided by the plugin to show a form on a custom page of your site: the customer can enter the gift card code and check the remaining balance. Read more about this shortcode [here](https://docs.yithemes.com/yith-woocommerce-gift-cards/premium-version-guide/shortcodes/check-gift-card-balance/).

#### Can I customize the gift card template?

Yes, you can customize images and logos for the gift cards you create by following [this guide](https://docs.yithemes.com/yith-woocommerce-gift-cards/premium-version-guide/style/).

#### Is it possible to set an expiration date for a gift card?

Yes, from the Global settings, you can set up how many months the gift card is valid for: this will automatically calculate the expiration date for every purchased gift card.
 Additionally, you can also set a custom expiration date from the product edit page as explained [here](https://docs.yithemes.com/yith-woocommerce-gift-cards/premium-version-guide/gift-card-creation/set-a-gift-card-expiration/).

#### Does the plugin support currency switcher plugins?

Yes, the plugin is compatible with Aelia Currency Switcher, WPML Multiple Currency and [YITH Multi Currency Switcher for WooCommerce](https://yithemes.com/themes/plugins/yith-multi-currency-switcher-for-woocommerce/).

#### Can I set a minimum amount for the gift cards with the option for users to add their own amount?

Yes, from the plugin global settings and product edit page, you can set the minimum amount the customer needs to add to be able to purchase the gift card.

#### Can I create a gallery of images for the gift cards?

Yes, of course! You can create a gallery and organise images into categories so users can select the template to associate to the gift card from the product page. You can read more how to set this up [here](https://docs.yithemes.com/yith-woocommerce-gift-cards/premium-version-guide/create-design-templates-for-gift-cards/).
