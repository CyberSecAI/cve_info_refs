- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Configuration secrets for log forwarding server profiles ("http", "email", and "snmptrap" v3) are logged to the `logrcvr.log` system log.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information exposure through log files (CWE-532). The log file can contain up to 1024 bytes of the configuration, including usernames, passwords (encrypted), and private keys used in certificate profiles for log forwarding.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exposure of sensitive information including credentials and private keys, potentially allowing an attacker with access to the log files to compromise systems that rely on the exposed credentials for log forwarding.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the PAN-OS device where `logrcvr.log` is stored.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs high privileges to access the log files.
