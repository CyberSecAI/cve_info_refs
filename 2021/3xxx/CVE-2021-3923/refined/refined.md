{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `ib_copy_ah_attr_to_user()` function in the Linux kernel only initializes the `resp.grh` field if the `resp.is_global` flag is set. When this flag is not set, the `resp.grh` field remains uninitialized, and this uninitialized stack data is then copied to the user, resulting in an information leak.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information Leak. Uninitialized stack data is copied to the user-space, potentially exposing sensitive kernel information.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A privileged local attacker can leak kernel stack information by issuing commands to the `/dev/infiniband/rdma_cm` device node. While this leak is unlikely to reveal sensitive user information, it can be used to defeat existing kernel protection mechanisms.",
  "Attack vectors": "A privileged local user needs to send commands to the `/dev/infiniband/rdma_cm` device node.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A privileged local account."
