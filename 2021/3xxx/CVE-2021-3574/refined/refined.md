{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A memory leak was found when converting a crafted TIFF file due to a missing check for the number of samples per pixel exceeding the maximum allowed, leading to a memory allocation without proper cleanup.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory leak.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Memory leaks, potentially leading to denial-of-service if the application consumes too much memory.",
  "Attack vectors": "Processing a specially crafted TIFF file using the `convert` command of ImageMagick.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted TIFF file to ImageMagick for processing."
