- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the device.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The device allows an unauthenticated attacker to download an encrypted log file that contains sensitive information.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information, specifically WiFi SSID and password.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack can be performed over the same subnet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same subnet as the vulnerable device and doesn't require authentication.
