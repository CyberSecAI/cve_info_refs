Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3393:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided content from NetApp, Red Hat, and the PostgreSQL project explicitly mentions CVE-2021-3393 and describes the vulnerability related to information disclosure through partition constraint violations in PostgreSQL. Thus, this content is related to CVE-2021-3393.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability lies in how PostgreSQL handles partition constraint violations, particularly when a user attempts an `UPDATE` operation on a partitioned table but lacks the `SELECT` privilege on a column in the target partition, or when the physical order of the columns between the parent and child partition are different.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability is a memory disclosure issue where a user lacking the `SELECT` privilege on a column can potentially acquire the values of the denied column through error messages.
*   **Incorrect privilege check:** The vulnerability occurs due to incorrect privilege checking while handling the violation of partition constraints. Instead of masking sensitive information from error messages, the system leaks it when constraint checks fail during updates on partitioned tables where column definitions vary across the partitions.
*    **Incorrect mapping of modified columns**: During tuple routing on partitioned tables, when tuples were routed from a parent table, they were converted to the parent's format. However, the list of modified columns was being taken directly from the child's Range Table Entry (RTE) instead of the parent RTE, resulting in the tuple information being leaked.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to **disclosure of sensitive information** that a user should not have access to due to lack of select privileges on the affected columns.
*   The attacker can use this flaw to obtain information stored in a column they are allowed to write but not read.
*    Furthermore, incorrect column mapping during tuple lock acquisition could lead to a wrong tuple lock being taken, which could affect the integrity and availibility of referential integrity, specifically when using  `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE`.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Attack Vector (AV:N):** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **Low Attack Complexity (AC:L):** The attack is considered of low complexity.
*   **Low Privileges Required (PR:L):** The attacker requires low privileges within the database to perform the exploit, such as having `UPDATE` access on a partitioned table.
*   **No User Interaction Required (UI:N):** Exploitation does not require any user interaction.
*   **Unchanged Scope (S:U):** The scope of the attack is unchanged, which means that the vulnerability affects the component it is in.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Database User:** The attacker needs to be a user with access to the PostgreSQL database.
*   **Update Privilege:** The attacker needs to have `UPDATE` privileges on a partitioned table.
*   **Lack of Select Privilege (on specific column(s)):** The attacker must not have `SELECT` privileges on the target column(s) from which they are trying to obtain information.
*   **Ability to craft specific queries:** The attacker needs to be able to craft specific `UPDATE` queries that cause a partition constraint violation, or use an `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE` to exploit a wrong tuple lock.
*    **Knowledge of database schemas:** An attacker should know what tables are partitioned and what columns may be present in specific partitions.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected PostgreSQL Versions**: The vulnerability affects PostgreSQL versions before 11.11, 12.6, and 13.2.
*   **NetApp Products**: NetApp stated that no products were affected, but that several of their products include the vulnerable versions of PostgreSQL.
*    **Red Hat Products**: Red Hat has released a security advisory addressing this vulnerability in their `postgresql:12` module.
*   **Mitigation**:  There are no workarounds mentioned in either NetApp's or Red Hat's advisories. Applying the provided updates of PostgreSQL to version 11.11, 12.6 and 13.2 and higher is the only remediation.

In summary, CVE-2021-3393 is a privilege-escalation vulnerability in PostgreSQL where an authenticated user with low privileges can potentially acquire sensitive data from columns that are specifically denied through a malformed query exploiting error messages or incorrect column mapping that leads to wrong tuple lock being acquired. The vulnerability is rated as medium severity.
