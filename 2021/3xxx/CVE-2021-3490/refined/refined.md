Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3490:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) implementation within the Linux kernel. Specifically, it's in how the eBPF verifier tracks bounds during bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR) when dealing with 32-bit values.
- The verifier did not correctly update the 32-bit bounds of registers involved in bitwise operations when both the source and destination sub-registers were known constants. It incorrectly assumed that the `scalar_min_max_*()` functions would handle the 32-bit bound updates in these situations, which was not the case, leading to an invalid state where min value > max value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Bounds Tracking:** The core issue is that the eBPF verifier's logic for tracking 32-bit register bounds during bitwise operations was flawed. The verifier failed to update bounds when both the source and destination subregisters had known constant values, which caused `s32_min_value` and `u32_min_value` to become larger than `s32_max_value` and `u32_max_value`.
- **Lack of Validation:** This is a lack of proper validation of user-supplied eBPF programs prior to execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Out-of-bounds Read/Write:** By exploiting the incorrect bounds tracking, an attacker can craft malicious eBPF programs that can perform out-of-bounds memory reads and writes in the kernel.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can be leveraged to cause a system crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can potentially achieve arbitrary code execution within the kernel context due to the ability to perform out-of-bounds memory access, leading to privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** The attack requires the ability to execute code with low privileges on the target system.
- **Malicious eBPF Program:** The attack is performed by crafting and loading a specially designed malicious eBPF program that exploits the incorrect bounds tracking.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to execute code.
- **eBPF Loading Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to load and execute eBPF programs on the system. This usually requires certain capabilities, but as the provided information shows, low privilege code execution is enough in this case.
- **Knowledge of eBPF:** The attacker needs an understanding of how eBPF works to craft an exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was introduced in Linux kernel versions 5.7-rc1 (for AND/OR) and 5.10-rc1 (for XOR) and there was no backport to any upstream LTS kernel.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Manfred Paul of the RedRocket CTF team and reported to Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
- The fix was implemented in commit `049c4e13714ecbca567b4d5f6d563f05d431c80e`.
- The fix involves correctly updating the 32-bit bounds using `__mark_reg32_known()` when both source and destination registers have known constant values. This ensures the 32-bit minimum and maximum values are accurate after the bitwise operation.
