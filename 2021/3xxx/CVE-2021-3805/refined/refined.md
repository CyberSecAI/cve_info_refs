Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3805:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Prototype pollution vulnerability exists in the `del()`, `empty()`, `push()` and `insert()` functions of the `node-object-path` library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability occurs when the library is used with "inherited props" mode enabled. This can happen in two ways:
    - When a new `object-path` instance is created with the `includeInheritedProps` option set to `true`.
    - When using the `withInheritedProps` default instance.
- The functions `del()`, `empty()`, `push()`, and `insert()` are vulnerable to prototype pollution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially modify the prototype of JavaScript objects, leading to unexpected behavior in the application using the library.
- This could allow an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code, although this specific impact is not mentioned in the provided text, the nature of prototype pollution vulnerabilities often lead to this.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by using the vulnerable functions (`del()`, `empty()`, `push()`, `insert()`) with inherited props enabled.
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input parameters of these functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to have the ability to control or influence the `object-path` library's usage within an application. Specifically, they would need to be able to invoke one of the vulnerable functions (`del()`, `empty()`, `push()`, `insert()`) with crafted input when the "inherited props" mode is enabled.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided text also references CVE-2021-23434, which is a separate vulnerability related to type confusion and bypass of a previous fix in the library.
- The Debian Security Advisory (DLA 3291-1) indicates that version `0.11.4-2+deb10u2` fixes both CVE-2021-3805 and CVE-2021-23434 for Debian 10 (buster).
