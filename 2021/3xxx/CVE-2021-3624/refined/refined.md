- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Integer overflow in `foveon_load_camf()` leads to small memory allocation, causing a buffer overflow when data is read into the undersized buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow, buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution or program crash.
- **Attack vectors**: A maliciously crafted X3F input image.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious X3F image to the vulnerable software.
