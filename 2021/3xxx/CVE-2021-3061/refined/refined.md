- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS command line interface (CLI).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS command injection (CWE-78).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated administrator with access to the CLI can execute arbitrary OS commands, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the PAN-OS CLI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator with access to the PAN-OS CLI.
