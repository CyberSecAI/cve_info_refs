  "cve": "CVE-2021-3655",
  "description": "Ilja Van Sprundel and Marcelo Ricardo Leitner found multiple flaws in the SCTP implementation, where missing validation could lead to an out-of-bounds read. On a system using SCTP, a networked attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service (crash).",
  "affected_component": "SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel",
  "root_cause": "Missing size validations on inbound SCTP packets.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Out-of-bounds read due to missing validation."
  ],
   "attack_vectors": [
    "Networked attacker sending malicious SCTP packets."
  ],
  "impact": "Denial of service (crash).",
  "required_capabilities": "Ability to send network packets to a system using SCTP.",
  "additional_info": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending SCTP packets with invalid size parameters, which could cause the kernel to read uninitialized memory, leading to a crash.",
  "fix": "The fix involves adding size validations to the SCTP input processing code to ensure that parameters have valid lengths before accessing them, preventing out-of-bounds memory reads."
