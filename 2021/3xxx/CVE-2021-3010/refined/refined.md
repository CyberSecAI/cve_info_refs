Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities:

**CVE ID:** The provided content does not reference a CVE ID. The exploit information from Exploit-DB does not have a corresponding CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerabilities are insufficient input sanitization and lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within OpenText Content Server 20.3

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Document Versions:**
    *   The application allows users to inject arbitrary JavaScript code through the "comment" field when creating new document versions.
    *   The application does not sanitize or encode user input in the document version description/comment, which results in a stored XSS vulnerability.
2.  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Project Banner:**
    *   The application allows users to create malicious project banners with a "javascript://" URL scheme.
    *   The application fails to properly validate the URL scheme provided by the user for the project banner URL, allowing JavaScript execution when a user clicks on it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation of either vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can potentially steal session cookies, allowing them to impersonate legitimate users.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive information or data available in the context of the user's session.
*   **Phishing:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites, potentially stealing credentials or installing malware.
*   **Defacement:** Attackers can modify the displayed content or functionality of the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Document Version XSS:** An attacker needs to have permissions to create new document versions. They insert the malicious script into the document version "comment" field. The payload is executed when other users view the document's version history.
2.  **Project Banner XSS:** An attacker can craft a malicious project banner and save it to the server. The payload is triggered when a user clicks on the malicious banner.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Document Version XSS:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the necessary permissions to create new document versions within the OpenText Content Server application.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to submit HTTP requests to the server.
*   **Project Banner XSS:**
    *  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the necessary permissions to modify project banner settings.
    * The attacker needs to be able to submit HTTP requests to the server.

**Additional Notes:**
* The Exploit-DB entry provides proof-of-concept exploit code.
* The provided information gives more details than the official CVE description, which is a placeholder.
* This exploit works on OpenText Content Server version 20.3.
