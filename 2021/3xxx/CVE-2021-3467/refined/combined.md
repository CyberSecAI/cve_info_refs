| Note that this closely related to / the same issue as [#265](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/issues/265). That issue was closed as resolved via the patch for [#264](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/issues/264), but it apparently only resolved the problem by making it unreachable with the specific test file.  As previously mentioned in [#265](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/issues/265), the crash was first reproducible in version 2.0.20, specifically as of commit [a4dc77c](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/commit/a4dc77cca1163347d0aa677d56da332c3f119021). The relationship of that commit to this crash wasn't obvious to me, so here's what I found investigating it further.  The relevant part of the [a4dc77c](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/commit/a4dc77cca1163347d0aa677d56da332c3f119021) is the `depth` check added to `jas_image_cmpt_create()` - both test images, here and in [#265](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/issues/265), fail the check because of both `depth` and `sgnd` being 1. Due to that, `jas_image_cmpt_create()` returns NULL to its caller `jas_image_addcmpt()`, which immediately reports error with -1 return value:  <https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/blob/version-2.0.27/src/libjasper/base/jas_image.c#L858-L863>  This error condition is handled in `jas_image_depalettize()` and causes error to be returned by that function as well:  <https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/blob/version-2.0.27/src/libjasper/base/jas_image.c#L1043-L1045>  However, the error return from `jas_image_depalettize()` is not handled in `jp2_decode()`:  <https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/blob/version-2.0.27/src/libjasper/jp2/jp2_dec.c#L389-L393>  In that code, `dec->chantocmptlut[channo]` is set to refer to component that wasn't created, resulting in an attempt to use an uninitialized memory here:  <https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/blob/version-2.0.26/src/libjasper/jp2/jp2_dec.c#L454-L455>  The fix in [f94e749](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/commit/f94e7499a8b1471a4905c4f9c9e12e60fe88264b) should guard against uninitialized memory use at that spot, but I wonder if this should be / have been fixed via proper check if `jas_image_depalettize()` failed.  I actually see that [#268](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/issues/268) / [c4144a6](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/commit/c4144a6fdb2660794136d1daaa80682ee40b138b) had the same cause, it was only triggering the uninitialized memory use at a different place:  <https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/blob/version-2.0.25/src/libjasper/jp2/jp2_dec.c#L438-L439> |

| Note that I do not consider [a4dc77c](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/commit/a4dc77cca1163347d0aa677d56da332c3f119021) commit to introduce the issue or 2.0.20 be the first affected version. There were other reasons why `jas_image_cmpt_create()` could return error prior to that commit. However, is seems that the reproducers triggering the `depth` check failures are easier to create via fuzzing. |

| [@thoger](https://github.com/thoger) I hope that I understood your comments correctly. I agree with your assessment that the return type of the depalettizing function should be checked and also there is a null pointer dereference at least in some cases. This should be fixed now in commit [717aeda](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/commit/717aeda40883b91f51161ea6c5dcac5f50ef7a59). Can you please confirm that I did understand your comments correctly and things seem okay now on your side? Thanks. |

| [@thoger](https://github.com/thoger) You posted comments against several issues but they all seem to be covered by [#269](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/issues/269). I think that [#269](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/issues/269) has now been fixed correctly. If I have misunderstood and any of the comments that you made against issues recently are not addressed, please let me know. Otherwise, I will assume everything is now ok. |

The JP2 decoder was not checking if a component number referenced by
a CDEF box was valid.  This has now been fixed.  A new test case
related to this bug has been added to the test suite as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1942097#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2021-03-23 16:18:11 UTC  ``` A NULL pointer dereference flaw was reported in Jasper 2.0.25 in the JP2 decoder.  The problem is related to insufficient validation of component references from CDEF boxes in the jp2_decode() function in src/libjasper/jp2/jp2_dec.c.  Upstream issue: <https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/issues/268>  Upstream patch: <https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/commit/c4144a6fdb2660794136d1daaa80682ee40b138b>  The fix was applied in version 2.0.26.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1942097#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2021-03-23 16:21:34 UTC  ``` Created jasper tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1942098](show_bug.cgi?id=1942098 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2021-3467 jasper: NULL pointer dereference in jp2_decode() in jp2_dec.c [fedora-all]")]   Created mingw-jasper tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1942099](show_bug.cgi?id=1942099 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2021-3467 mingw-jasper: jasper: NULL pointer dereference in jp2_decode() in jp2_dec.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1942097#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2021-03-23 16:29:07 UTC  ``` Note that the fist Jasper version that crashes with the reproducer included in the upstream bug report is 2.0.20.  However, the problem exists in earlier versions as well.  More detailed analysis can be found in the upstream issue:  <https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/issues/269#issuecomment-804423097>   ``` |  |
