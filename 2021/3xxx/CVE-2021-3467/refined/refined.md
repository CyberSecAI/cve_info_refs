  "CVE-2021-3467": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `jp2_decode` function within `jp2_dec.c` due to insufficient validation of component references in CDEF boxes in the JP2 image format decoder.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The code doesn't properly validate component references in the CDEF box, leading to use of uninitialized memory.",
         "The error return from `jas_image_depalettize()` is not handled in `jp2_decode()`."
      ],
      "impact": "A specially crafted JP2 image file can cause an application using the Jasper library to crash due to a null pointer dereference, leading to a denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By providing a malicious JP2 file to an application using the Jasper library"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a specially crafted JP2 image file with invalid component references in the CDEF box."
    },
    "affected_versions": "Versions prior to 2.0.26 are affected.",
    "fix_versions": "Fixed in version 2.0.26.",
    "additional_notes": [
         "The vulnerability is related to how Jasper handles component references in CDEF box.",
         "The issue was triggered by a `depth` check failure in `jas_image_cmpt_create()` which then leads to the usage of an uninitialized memory in `jp2_decode()`",
         "The initial fix in commit `c4144a6` addressed the invalid component reference but not the unhandled return from  `jas_image_depalettize()`. A later fix in commit `717aeda` addresses this."
