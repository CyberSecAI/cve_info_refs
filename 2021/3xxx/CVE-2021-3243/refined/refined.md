{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The WFilter ICF software uses a vulnerable runDll function accessible via the web interface. This function allows loading arbitrary DLL files and calling exported functions within them. The dll parameter does not have any filtering, allowing path traversal to call arbitrary DLLs, and the function and parameters are also attacker controlled.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted DLL loading",
      "Lack of input sanitization",
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server where WFilter ICF is installed.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack involves a combination of XSS and CSRF. The attacker crafts a malicious User-Agent string containing XSS payload which is then reflected in the 'web browsing' history of WFilter. When an administrator views this history, the XSS payload is executed. This payload triggers a CSRF request targeting the vulnerable runDll function and ultimately executes shell commands on the server.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to insert their traffic to be logged by the Wfilter software, and also needs to trick an administrator into viewing the web browsing history. The attacker also needs to craft both a XSS and a CSRF payload to execute the commands on the remote server."
