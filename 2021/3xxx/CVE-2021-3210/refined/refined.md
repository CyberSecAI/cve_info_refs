Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2021-3210.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application used the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` React component attribute to render help texts, which makes the application vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if input parameters are not properly sanitized. The `targetId` parameter was not encoded and was reflected in multiple "Abuse Info" texts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the lack of proper sanitization/encoding of user-controlled input (specifically the `targetId` parameter) passed to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The XSS vulnerability, in the context of an Electron-based application like BloodHound, can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could create a malicious data graph file with a crafted `targetId` that contains XSS payloads. When a victim imports the malicious data and clicks "Help" on an edge connected to a malicious node, the XSS payload will trigger.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to create a malicious data graph file (e.g., JSON file) and convince the victim to import this file into the BloodHound application. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the victim's system, and the attack can be performed as any normal user.
