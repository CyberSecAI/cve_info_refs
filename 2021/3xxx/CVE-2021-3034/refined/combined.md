### Description

An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in Cortex XSOAR software where the secrets configured for the SAML single sign-on (SSO) integration can be logged to the '/var/log/demisto/' server logs when testing the integration during setup.

This logged information includes the private key and identity provider certificate used to configure the SAML SSO integration.

This issue impacts:

Cortex XSOAR 5.5.0 builds earlier than 98622;

Cortex XSOAR 6.0.1 builds earlier than 830029;

Cortex XSOAR 6.0.2 builds earlier than 98623;

Cortex XSOAR 6.1.0 builds earlier than 848144.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| Cortex XSOAR 6.1.0 | < 848144 | >= 848144 |
| Cortex XSOAR 6.0.2 | < 98623 | >= 98623 |
| Cortex XSOAR 6.0.1 | < 830029 | None |
| Cortex XSOAR 5.5.0 | < 98622 | >= 98622 |

### Required Configuration for Exposure

This issue is applicable only to Cortex XSOAR appliances configured to use SAML SSO and where the 'Test' button or other integration testing functions, including testing automation, were used at some point.

### Severity: MEDIUM

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
5.1 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N))

### Exploitation Status

Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this issue.

### Weakness Type

[CWE-532 Information Exposure Through Log Files](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532")

### Solution

This issue is fixed in Cortex XSOAR 5.5.0 build 98622, Cortex XSOAR 6.0.2 build 98623, Cortex XSOAR 6.1.0 build 848144, and all later Cortex XSOAR versions.

All versions of Cortex XSOAR 6.0.1 should be upgraded to the latest version of Cortex XSOAR 6.0.2.

After you upgrade the Cortex XSOAR appliance, you must configure a new private key for SAML SSO integration. Clear the server system logs using the instructions provided in the Workarounds and Mitigations section to remove any potentially logged secrets.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

You must configure a new private key for SAML SSO integration and you should not run integration testing functions until after you complete the Cortex XSOAR upgrade.

You must clear all server system log files located in the '/var/log/demisto/' directory. There may be several files in this directory, including the server.log file and other archived server logs.

You can clear all server system logs by stopping the server and running the 'rm /var/log/demisto/server\*.log' command from the console.
