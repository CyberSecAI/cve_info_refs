- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the logging of sensitive information (private key and identity provider certificate) used for SAML SSO integration into the '/var/log/demisto/' server logs when the integration is tested during setup.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information exposure through log files (CWE-532) where secrets related to SAML SSO configuration are logged.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of sensitive information including private keys and identity provider certificates. This could allow an attacker to potentially impersonate users or gain unauthorized access to the system. The confidentiality impact is rated as high and the integrity impact is rated as low.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the server where Cortex XSOAR is installed and access to the server logs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs high privileges on the local machine where Cortex XSOAR is installed to access the server logs directory. The attacker also requires that the vulnerable software have SAML SSO configured and that the integration testing function has been run.
