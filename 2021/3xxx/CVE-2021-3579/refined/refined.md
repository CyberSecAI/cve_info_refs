Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-3579:

**Root Cause:** Incorrect default permissions assigned to `bdservicehost.exe` and `Vulnerability.Scan.exe` components within Bitdefender products. This allows a low-privileged process to impersonate the client of a pipe.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Incorrect Default Permissions:** The core issue lies in the misconfiguration of permissions for the vulnerable executables.
*   **Unrestricted Pipe Impersonation:** An untrusted process can impersonate the client of a named pipe, which is used for inter-process communication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker with low privileges can elevate their privileges to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, the highest privilege level in Windows.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low-Privileged Access:** The attacker must first gain a foothold and be able to execute low-privileged code on the target Windows system.
*   **Ability to Interact with Named Pipes:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with and potentially impersonate clients of the named pipes used by the vulnerable components.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed without a patch due to the ZDI 120-day deadline.
*   A fix was released in Bitdefender Endpoint Security Tools version 7.2.1.65 and Bitdefender Total Security version 25.0.26.
*   The vulnerability affects Bitdefender Endpoint Security Tools for Windows versions prior to 7.2.1.65 and Bitdefender Total Security versions prior to 7.2.1.65.
*   Mitigation advice before the patch was released is to restrict interaction with the application.

**CVSS Score**:
*   7.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (from Bitdefender advisory)
*   7.0 - AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (from ZDI advisory)

**Note**: There is a discrepancy in the CVSS score and Attack Complexity (AC) between the two advisories. The ZDI advisory notes High Attack Complexity while Bitdefender lists it as Low.
