Subject: [[PATCH v1 1/1] nitro_enclaves: Fix stale file descriptors on failed usercopy](#r)
Date: Thu, 29 Apr 2021 19:59:41 +0300	[[thread overview]](#r)
Message-ID: <20210429165941.27020-2-andraprs@amazon.com> (<raw>)
In-Reply-To: <[20210429165941.27020-1-andraprs@amazon.com](../20210429165941.27020-1-andraprs%40amazon.com/)>

From: Mathias Krause <minipli@grsecurity.net>

A failing usercopy of the slot uid will lead to a stale entry in the
file descriptor table as put_unused_fd() won't release it. This enables
userland to refer to a dangling 'file' object through that still valid
file descriptor, leading to all kinds of use-after-free exploitation
scenarios.

Exchanging put_unused_fd() for close_fd(), ksys_close() or alike won't
solve the underlying issue, as the file descriptor might have been
replaced in the meantime, e.g. via userland calling close() on it
(leading to a NULL pointer dereference in the error handling code as
'fget(enclave_fd)' will return a NULL pointer) or by dup2()'ing a
completely different file object to that very file descriptor, leading
to the same situation: a dangling file descriptor pointing to a freed
object -- just in this case to a file object of user's choosing.

Generally speaking, after the call to fd_install() the file descriptor
is live and userland is free to do whatever with it. We cannot rely on
it to still refer to our enclave object afterwards. In fact, by abusing
userfaultfd() userland can hit the condition without any racing and
abuse the error handling in the nitro code as it pleases.

To fix the above issues, defer the call to fd_install() until all
possible errors are handled. In this case it's just the usercopy, so do
it directly in ne_create_vm_ioctl() itself.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1953022#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-04-23 18:21:24 UTC  ``` A failing usercopy of the slot uid will lead to a stale entry in the file descriptor table as put_unused_fd() won't release it. This enables userland to refer to a dangling 'file' object through that still valid file descriptor, leading to all kinds of use-after-free exploitation scenarios.  Exchanging put_unused_fd() for close_fd(), ksys_close() or alike won't solve the underlying issue, as the file descriptor might have been replaced in the meantime, e.g. via userland calling close() on it (leading to a NULL pointer dereference in the error handling code as 'fget(enclave_fd)' will return a NULL pointer) or by dup2()'ing a completely different file object to that very file descriptor, leading to the same situation: a dangling file descriptor pointing to a freed object -- just in this case to a file object of user's choosing.  Generally speaking, after the call to fd_install() the file descriptor is live and userland is free to do whatever with it. We cannot rely on it to still refer to our enclave object afterwards. In fact, by abusing userfaultfd() userland can hit the condition without any racing and abuse the error handling in the nitro code as it pleases.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1953022#c5)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-04-30 12:43:24 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1955580](show_bug.cgi?id=1955580 "CLOSED ERRATA - kernel: nitro_enclaves stale file descriptors on failed usercopy [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1953022#c6)  Alex    2021-05-02 14:45:37 UTC  ``` External References:  [https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210429165941.27020-2-andraprs@amazon.com/](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210429165941.27020-2-andraprs%40amazon.com/)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1953022#c9)  Alex    2021-05-03 15:59:46 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw is rated as having a Moderate impact because in the default configuration, the issue can only be triggered by a privileged local user (with access to the ne group if this user manages Enclaves VMs).   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1953022#c22)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-06-01 09:43:28 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2021:2169 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:2169](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A2169)   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1953022#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-06-01 11:04:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2021:2168 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:2168](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A2168)   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1953022#c24)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-06-01 11:32:11 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
