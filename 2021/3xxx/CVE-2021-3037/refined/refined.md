- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the logging of connection details for scheduled configuration exports within system logs in cleartext.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information exposure through debug log files (CWE-534). The cleartext logging of username, password, and IP address for scheduled configuration exports constitutes a significant information leak.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the system logs could obtain credentials for the destination server used for configuration exports, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data breaches. The impact is limited to confidentiality as there is no mention of integrity or availability being affected.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs access to the PAN-OS device's system logs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A high privilege level is required to access system logs, meaning the attacker must have administrative access to the PAN-OS device.
