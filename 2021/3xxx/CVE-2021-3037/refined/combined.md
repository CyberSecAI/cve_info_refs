### Description

An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software where the connection details for a scheduled configuration export are logged in system logs.

Logged information includes the cleartext username, password, and IP address used to export the PAN-OS configuration to the destination server.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 10.0 | None | >= 10.0.0 |
| PAN-OS 9.1 | < 9.1.4 | >= 9.1.4 |
| PAN-OS 9.0 | < 9.0.13 | >= 9.0.13 |
| PAN-OS 8.1 | < 8.1.19 | >= 8.1.19 |

### Required Configuration for Exposure

This issue is only applicable to PAN-OS devices that have been configured to use scheduled configuration exports at any time.

### Severity: LOW

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
2.3 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N))

### Exploitation Status

Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this issue.

### Weakness Type

[CWE-534 Information Exposure Through Debug Log Files](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/534 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/534")

### Solution

This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.19, PAN-OS 9.0.13, PAN-OS 9.1.4, and all later PAN-OS versions.

After you upgrade the PAN-OS appliance, you must change the connection details used in scheduled configuration exports. You should also change the credentials on the destination server that are used to export the configuration.
