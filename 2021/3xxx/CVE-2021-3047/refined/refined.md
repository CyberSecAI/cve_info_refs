- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is used during authentication to the Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of a cryptographically weak PRNG.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker, who has authenticated access to the PAN-OS web interface and is capable of observing their own authentication secrets over time, can impersonate another authenticated web interface administrator's session.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack, by observing their own authentication secrets over a long period of time.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have authenticated access to the PAN-OS web interface. They also need to be able to observe their own authentication secrets over a long duration on the PAN-OS appliance.
