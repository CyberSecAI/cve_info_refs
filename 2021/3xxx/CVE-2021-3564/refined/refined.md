  "CVE-2021-3564": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the BlueTooth subsystem when the HCI device initialization fails. It can lead to unexpected results, like double-free memory corruption vulnerability.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the `hci_dev_do_open()` function within the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem during HCI device initialization. When initialization fails, the function attempts to clean up resources, however, a race can occur where `hci_cmd_work()` is activated even after its associated work structure has been flushed. This leads to a double-free scenario.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Race Condition",
        "Double Free"
      ],
      "impact": "A successful exploit can lead to kernel memory corruption, resulting in a system crash or potential privilege escalation.",
      "attack_vectors": "Local, by attaching a malicious HCI TTY Bluetooth device to trigger the vulnerability.",
        "required_capabilities": "No special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability as the device is set to HCI_AUTO_OFF state by default, and the bug exists inside the very first attaching procedure, not requiring any syscalls."
