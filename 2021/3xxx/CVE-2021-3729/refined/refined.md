The provided content relates to a commit fixing a vulnerability, as indicated by the commit message "Fix <https://huntr.dev/bounties/d32f3d5a-0738-41ba-89de-34f2a772de76/>". While the commit details don't explicitly mention CVE-2021-3729, the huntr.dev link is likely associated with the CVE. The commit message and changes suggest that a vulnerability related to currency handling was addressed.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The commit primarily focuses on changes within `CurrencyController.php` and `public/v1/js/ff/currencies/index.js`, suggesting an issue related to how currency settings are handled, specifically setting a default currency. The vulnerability seems to stem from a lack of proper validation or handling when setting the default currency via a POST request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure direct object reference (IDOR) for setting default currency**: The original code in `CurrencyController.php` allowed setting a default currency using a provided `id` parameter. This could potentially allow an attacker to set an arbitrary currency as default, even if the attacker didn't have the rights to modify currencies. The code was modified to ensure that the currency being set as default actually exists in the system and is valid.
*   **Missing CSRF protection**: Although not explicitly stated, a potential weakness was present in the `public/v1/js/ff/currencies/index.js` where the javascript submits the request to set the default currency using `$.post` method. If the CSRF token wasn't properly included it could lead to an exploit. This is corrected by adding the CSRF token to the POST request using `_token: token,`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to:

*   Set an arbitrary currency as the default for all users
*   Cause disruption
*   Potentially manipulate financial data if the attacker was able to set a malicious or unexpected currency as default.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector appears to be through a crafted POST request to the `defaultCurrency` route, potentially by manipulating the `id` parameter.
*   The user would have to be logged in to the application to be able to trigger the vulnerability, but they would not require to be a site owner.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a logged-in user on the application.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests with manipulated data.
