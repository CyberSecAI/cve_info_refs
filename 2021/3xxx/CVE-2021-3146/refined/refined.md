- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Untrusted search path vulnerability in the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library. The application loads a DLL (dwmapi.dll) from the current working directory instead of the system directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure DLL loading, specifically the application searching for and loading DLLs from the current working directory. This is a variation of the "DLL hijacking" vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local users can gain higher privileges by placing a malicious DLL (dwmapi.dll) in the same directory as the vulnerable application. When the application runs, it will load this malicious DLL, which can then execute code with the privileges of the vulnerable application.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker places a malicious DLL (dwmapi.dll) in the same directory as the vulnerable Dolby Audio X2 (DAX2) API service executable. The vulnerability is triggered when the service executes within a directory containing specific files like TRC, cur, rs, rct, or res files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have the ability to write files to the local file system. Specifically, they must have the ability to create a directory and place the malicious DLL and other specific file types in that directory. They also need the ability to execute the vulnerable Dolby Audio X2 (DAX2) API service.
