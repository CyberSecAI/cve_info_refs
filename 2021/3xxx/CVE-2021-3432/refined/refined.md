- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An invalid interval value in a `CONNECT_IND` message leads to a division by zero error.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Division by zero (CWE-369)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service due to the division by zero error, causing a crash or unpredictable behavior.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker sends a crafted `CONNECT_IND` message with an invalid interval value via Bluetooth.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range (adjacent network) to send the crafted message. No special privileges or user interaction is required.
