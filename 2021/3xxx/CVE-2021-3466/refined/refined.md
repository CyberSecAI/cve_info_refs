{
  "CVE-2021-3466": {
    "Description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in GNU Libmicrohttpd.  A missing bounds check in the post_process_urlencoded function leads to a buffer overflow, allowing a remote attacker to write arbitrary data in an application that uses libmicrohttpd.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing bounds check before copying the POST key string in the post_process_urlencoded function, not ensuring that the internal buffer is big enough to hold the key.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
       "Missing Bounds Check"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker may exploit this flaw in an application that uses libmicrohttpd to perform a classic buffer overflow and potentially execute code on the victim machine.  The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can send a crafted HTTP request with a specially crafted URL encoded key to trigger the buffer overflow.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to a service using the vulnerable libmicrohttpd library. No special privileges needed."
