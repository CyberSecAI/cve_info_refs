Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3753:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a race condition in the Linux kernel's virtual terminal (vt) driver, specifically within the `vt_ioctl` function when handling the `KDSETMODE` command.
- The core issue is that write access to `vc->vc_mode` is not protected by a lock in `vt_ioctl` when setting the graphics mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Race Condition:** Multiple threads can access and modify the `vc->vc_mode` variable concurrently without proper synchronization.
- **Out-of-Bounds Read:** This race condition can lead to an out-of-bounds read in the virtual terminal driver. Specifically the `vc_visible_origin` is set without proper locking and can lead to reading from an arbitrary memory location via the `sel_pos` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information by reading out of bounds memory.
- **Potential for other impacts:** While the primary impact is information disclosure, it is possible that this out of bounds read could be leveraged for further exploitation such as a denial of service or code execution

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attacker needs to make system calls via ioctl on the virtual terminal devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the system, thus requiring a local user or having the ability to gain access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger specific ioctl commands on the virtual terminal.
- The attacker needs the ability to create multiple threads to trigger the race condition.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability occurs in `drivers/tty/vt/vt_ioctl.c`.
- The vulnerable code is within the `vt_ioctl` function when handling the `KDSETMODE` command.
- The race occurs when setting the graphics mode (KD_GRAPHICS) to `vc->vc_mode`.
- The patch extends console locking to cover the `vc->vc_mode` access, preventing race conditions.

**Timeline:**

- **2021-08-30:** Vulnerability reported to `security@kernel.org`.
- **2021-08-31:** CVE-2021-3753 assigned.
- **2021-09-01:** Vulnerability opened.

**Patch:**

- The fix is available in the Linux kernel commit
   `https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/2287a51ba822384834dafc1c798453375d1107c7`
- The patch extends the console lock to prevent concurrent access to `vc->vc_mode` in `vt_kdsetmode`.

**Additional Information:**

- NetApp has issued an advisory (NTAP-20221028-0003) indicating that several of their products are affected and provides links to patches and affected products.
