Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3563:

**1. Verification:**

*   The identified vulnerability is present in `openstack-keystone`.
*   The core issue is that the system only validates the first 72 characters of an application secret, while ignoring any characters beyond that limit.
*   This limitation leads to potential bypass of password complexity policies implemented by administrators.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The primary vulnerability lies in the insufficient input validation of application secrets within openstack-keystone. By truncating the secret to its first 72 characters, it allows for potential circumvention of password complexity rules.
*   **Password Complexity Bypass:** Due to the above weakness,  attackers can exploit this flaw to bypass certain password complexity rules imposed by administrators.
*   **Lack of Brute Force Protection** The application credential API doesn't seem to have the lockout features present for normal logins.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Confidentiality and Integrity:** The exploitation of this flaw can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of data.
*   **Bypass Password Complexity:** Attackers can create secrets that do not conform to the full intended complexity requirements, making them easier to compromise.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** This is a network-based vulnerability.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required**: No specific privileges are required for exploitation according to the CVSS vector.
*   **High Attack Complexity:** Exploitation has a high complexity, suggesting that the conditions for a successful attack are not easily met.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple SUSE OpenStack products, with fixes provided for some releases and identified as "Ignore" or "Unsupported" for others which are at End Of Life.
*   Red Hat Bugzilla also tracks this issue under Bug 1962908 with a similar description and impact.
*   Upstream fix available, see also Launchpad bug #1901891
