    "related": true,
    "information": "Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the joystick input subsystem where the `joydev_handle_JSIOCSBTNMAP()` function does not properly handle a zero size parameter.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The code is vulnerable to out-of-bounds read and write due to the missing size check in the `joydev_handle_JSIOCSBTNMAP()` function, which leads to copying memory from/to an arbitrary location.\n\nImpact of exploitation: A local user can exploit this vulnerability to read and write out-of-bounds in the kernel, potentially leading to a system crash, denial of service (DoS), or privilege escalation.\n\nAttack vectors: Local attacker with access to a joystick device via the `/dev/input/js0` or similar device files.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: A local user is required to have access to a joystick device."
