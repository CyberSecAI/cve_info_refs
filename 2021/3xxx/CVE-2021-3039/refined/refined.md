- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A secret used to authorize the role of an authenticated user is logged to a debug log file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information exposure through log files (CWE-532).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Authenticated Operator or Auditor role users with access to the debug log files can use the leaked secret to gain Administrator role access for their active session in Prisma Cloud Compute.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based, requiring access to debug log files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have an authenticated Operator or Auditor role access to the Prisma Cloud Compute Console and access to the debug log files.
