### Description

An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks Prisma Cloud Compute Console where a secret used to authorize the role of the authenticated user is logged to a debug log file.

Authenticated Operator role and Auditor role users with access to the debug log files can use this secret to gain Administrator role access for their active session in Prisma Cloud Compute.

Prisma Cloud Compute SaaS versions were automatically upgraded to the fixed release.

This issue impacts all Prisma Cloud Compute versions earlier than Prisma Cloud Compute 21.04.412.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| Prisma Cloud Compute 20.04 | < 21.04.412 | >= 21.04.412 |
