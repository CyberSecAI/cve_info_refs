- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authorization in Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper authorization leading to unauthorized access to the REST API.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote unauthenticated attacker with network access can perform unauthorized actions through the REST API. This includes running commands and automations in the Cortex XSOAR War Room.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the Cortex XSOAR server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable Cortex XSOAR server. The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The vulnerability is only applicable to configurations with active API key integrations.
