**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the target user via the chat functionality of the Mitel BusinessCTI Enterprise (MBC-E).

**Additional details:**
- The affected product is Mitel BusinessCTI Enterprise (MBC-E) versions 6.4.14 and earlier.
