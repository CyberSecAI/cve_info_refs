- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin checks for the absence of the `post_password` POST parameter but doesn't handle the case where it's present, causing a bypass of the login protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Logic flaw in the conditional check within the `wp_loaded` function of the plugin. Specifically, the plugin checks for the absence of `$_POST['post_password']` to enforce its protection but doesn't account for when the field is present.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The protection offered by the WPS Hide Login plugin can be bypassed, allowing access to the standard WordPress login page, potentially exposing it to brute-force attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-login.php` endpoint including the `post_password` field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request, which is achievable by any user with network access to the WordPress site. The attacker does not require any special privileges.
