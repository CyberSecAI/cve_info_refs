### Description

An OS command injection vulnerability in the Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) feature of PAN-OS software allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker with specific knowledge of the firewall configuration to execute arbitrary code with root user privileges. The attacker must have network access to the GlobalProtect interfaces to exploit this issue.

This issue impacts:

PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.20-h1;

PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.14-h3;

PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.11-h2;

PAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.8;

PAN-OS 10.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.1.3.

Prisma Access customers with Prisma Access 2.1 Preferred and Prisma Access 2.1 Innovation firewalls are impacted by this issue.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 10.1 | < 10.1.3 | >= 10.1.3 |
| PAN-OS 10.0 | < 10.0.8 | >= 10.0.8 |
| PAN-OS 9.1 | < 9.1.11-h2 | >= 9.1.11-h2 |
| PAN-OS 9.0 | < 9.0.14-h3 | >= 9.0.14-h3 |
| PAN-OS 8.1 | < 8.1.20-h1 | >= 8.1.20-h1 |
| Prisma Access 2.2 | None | All |
| Prisma Access 2.1 | Preferred, Innovation | None |

### Required Configuration for Exposure

This issue is applicable only to GlobalProtect portal and gateway configurations that are configured with a SCEP profile and when the default master key was not changed.

You can determine if your configuration has a SCEP profile by selecting 'Device > Certificate Management > SCEP' from the web interface.

Note: The SCEP profile does not need to be enabled for the firewall to be at risk; it need only exist in the configuration to be a risk even if disabled.

You know you are using the default master key when the master key was not explicitly configured on the firewall. Review the master key configuration by selecting 'Device > Master Key and Diagnostics' from the web interface and change the key if needed.

### Severity: HIGH

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
8.1 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

### Exploitation Status

Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this issue at time of publication. However, a proof of concept script for this issue is publicly available.

### Weakness Type

[CWE-78 OS Command Injection](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78")

### Solution

This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.20-h1, PAN-OS 9.0.14-h3, PAN-OS 9.1.11-h2, PAN-OS 10.0.8, PAN-OS 10.1.3, and all later PAN-OS versions.

This issue is fixed in Prisma Access 2.2 Preferred and all later Prisma Access versions.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

Changing the master key for the firewall prevents exploitation of this vulnerability. This is a security best practice for both PAN-OS and Prisma Access customers.

Documentation for configuring the master key is available at: <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-0/pan-os-admin/certificate-management/configure-the-master-key.html>. Please note the special requirements for high-availability (HA) and Panorama-managed environments.

Additional information is available for Prisma Access customers at: <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-access/prisma-access-panorama-admin/prepare-the-prisma-access-infrastructure/get-started-with-prisma-access-overview>.

Remove all configured SCEP profiles from the firewall to completely eliminate any risk of exploitation related to this issue. You can view any existing SCEP profiles configured on the firewall by selecting 'Device > Certificate Management > SCEP' from the web interface.

This issue requires the attacker to have network access to the GlobalProtect interface.

In addition to these workarounds, you should enable signatures for Unique Threat ID 91526 on traffic destined for GlobalProtect interfaces to further mitigate the risk of attacks against CVE-2021-3060. SSL decryption is not necessary to detect attacks against this issue.

Master Key Encryption](/content/techdocs/en_US/pan-os/10-0/pan-os-admin/certificate-management/master-key-encryption.html)

---

# Configure the Master Key

Every firewall and Panorama management server
has a default master key that encrypts all the private keys and
passwords in the configuration to secure them (such as the private
key used for SSL Forward Proxy Decryption).

Change
the default master key as soon as possible to ensure that you use
a unique master key for encryption.
In a high availability
(HA) configuration, you must use the same master key on both firewalls
or Panorama in the pair. Otherwise, HA synchronization will not
work properly.If you are using Panorama to manage your firewalls,
you must configure the same master key on Panorama and all managed
firewalls. For managed firewalls in an HA configuration, you must
configure the same master key for each HA peer. See [Manage the Master Key from Panorama](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/panorama/10-0/panorama-admin/manage-firewalls/manage-the-master-key-from-panorama.html) if
the firewall is managed by a Panoramaâ¢ management server.Be
sure to store the master key in a safe location. You cannot recover
the master key and the only way to restore the default master key
is to [Reset
the Firewall to Factory Default Settings](/content/techdocs/en_US/pan-os/10-0/pan-os-admin/firewall-administration/reset-the-firewall-to-factory-default-settings.html#ide7aa6f33-1993-4057-86cf-c50105678cb8).

1. [Backup the configuration](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-0/pan-os-admin/firewall-administration/manage-configuration-backups.html).
2. (HA only) Disable Config Sync (required before
   deploying a new master key to any firewall HA pair).Before you deploy a new master key to any firewall HA pair,
   you must disable Config Sync. For Panorama-managed firewalls, if
   you do not disable Config Sync before deploying a new master key,
   Panorama loses connectivity to the primary firewall.
   1. Select DeviceHigh AvailabilityGeneral and
      edit the Setup.
   2. Disable (clear) Enable Config Sync and
      then click OK.
   3. Commit your configuration changes.
3. Select DeviceMaster
   Key and Diagnostics and edit the Master
   Key section.
4. Enter the Current Master Key if
   one exists.
5. Define a new New Master Key and
   then Confirm New Master Key. The key must
   contain exactly 16 characters.
6. To specify the master key Lifetime,
   enter the number of Days and/or Hours after
   which the key will expire.You must configure a new master key before the current
   key expires. If the master key expires, the firewall or Panorama
   automatically reboots in Maintenance mode. You must then [Reset
   the Firewall to Factory Default Settings](/content/techdocs/en_US/pan-os/10-0/pan-os-admin/firewall-administration/reset-the-firewall-to-factory-default-settings.html#ide7aa6f33-1993-4057-86cf-c50105678cb8).

   Set the Lifetime to
   two years or less, depending on how many encryptions the device
   performs. The more encryptions a device performs, the shorter the Lifetime you
   should set. The critical consideration is to not run out of unique encryptions
   before you change the master key. Each master key can provide up to
   232 unique encryptions based on the master key value
   and the Initialization Vector (IV) value. After 232 unique
   encryptions, encryptions repeat (are no longer unique), which is
   a security risk.Set a Time for Reminder value
   (see next step) for the master key and when the reminder notification
   occurs, change the master key.
7. Enter a Time for Reminder that
   specifies the number of Days and Hours before
   the master key expires when the firewall generates an expiration
   alarm. The firewall automatically opens the System Alarms dialog
   to display the alarm.

   Set the reminder so that it gives
   you plenty of time to configure a new master key before it expires
   in a scheduled maintenance window. When the Time for
   Reminder expires and the firewall or Panorama sends
   a notification log, change the master key, donât wait for the Lifetime to
   expire. For grouped devices, track every device (e.g., firewalls
   that Panorama manages and firewall HA pairs) and when the reminder value
   expires for the any device in the group, change the master key.To
   ensure the expiration alarm displays, select DeviceLog Settings, edit the Alarm
   Settings, and Enable Alarms.
8. Enable Auto Renew Master Key to
   configure the firewall to automatically renew the master key. To
   configure Auto Renew With Same Master Key, specify
   the number of Days and/or Hours to
   renew the same master key. The key extension allows the firewall
   to remain operational and continue securing your network; it is
   not a replacement for configuring a new key if the existing master
   key lifetime expires soon.Automatically renewing the master key has benefits and
   risks. The benefit is that extending the master key Lifetime protects
   against failure to change the master key before its lifetime expires.
   The risk is that encryptions will repeat and cause a security risk
   if the number of encryptions the device performs with the master
   key exceeds the number of unique encryptions the master key can
   generate (232 unique encryptions).

   If
   the Master Key expires (you do not automatically renew it and you do
   not replace it in a timely manner), the device goes into maintenance
   mode.

   If you enable Auto
   Renew Master Key, set it so that the total time (lifetime
   plus the auto renew time) does not cause the device to run out of unique
   encryptions. For example, if you believe the device will consume
   the master keyâs number of unique encryptions in two and a half
   years, you could set the Lifetime for two
   years, set the Time for Reminder to 60 days,
   and set the Auto Renew Master Key for 60-90
   days to provide the extra time to configure a new master key before
   the Lifetime expires. However, the best practice
   is still to change the master key before the lifetime expires to
   ensure that no device repeats encryptions.

   Consider the number of days until your
   next available maintenance window when configuring the master key
   to automatically renew after the lifetime of the key expires.
9. (Optional) For added security, select whether
   to use an HSM to encrypt the master key.
   For details, see [Encrypt
   a Master Key Using an HSM](/content/techdocs/en_US/pan-os/10-0/pan-os-admin/certificate-management/secure-keys-with-a-hardware-security-module/encrypt-a-master-key-using-an-hsm.html#idcfed3362-0889-443f-b062-8b7d11fda955).
10. Click OK and Commit.
11. (HA only) Re-enable Config Sync.
    1. Select DeviceHigh AvailabilityGeneral and
       edit the Setup.
    2. Enable (check) Enable Config Sync and
       then click OK.
    3. Commit your configuration changes.

## Two Ways to Manage Prisma Access

---

There are [two ways to manage Prisma Access](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma-access/administration/prisma-access-overview/how-to-manage-prisma-access.html): you can use Panorama or, for cloud management, you can use the new [Strata Cloud Manager](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cloud-management) platform. Before you get started with Prisma Access, you must decide on the management interface you want to use , as you cannot switch management interfaces once you begin.

Review the docs to validate feature support based on the management interface you're using; each topic covers feature parity and workflows across Panorama and cloud management with Strata Cloud Manager.
