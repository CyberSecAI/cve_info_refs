Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-3060

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) feature of PAN-OS software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **OS Command Injection:** The SCEP feature allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands.
*   The vulnerability is triggered if a SCEP profile exists in the firewall configuration, regardless of whether it is enabled or not.
*   Exploitation is possible if the default master key has not been changed

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary code with root user privileges on the affected firewall or Prisma Access instance.
*   This could lead to complete compromise of the system, including data theft, denial of service, or further lateral movement within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The attacker must have network access to the GlobalProtect interface of the firewall.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   Requires specific knowledge of the firewall configuration (related to SCEP and the master key)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the GlobalProtect interface of the vulnerable PAN-OS device or Prisma Access instance.
*   The attacker requires knowledge of whether a SCEP profile is configured.
*   The attacker requires knowledge of if the default master key is in use.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability exists in specific versions of PAN-OS and Prisma Access.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is publicly available.
*   Changing the master key mitigates the vulnerability.
*   Removing all SCEP profiles completely eliminates the risk.
*   A specific threat ID (91526) signature can be enabled to help detect attacks, without SSL decryption.
*   The issue is an RCE vulnerability.
*   There is no reliable indicator of compromise due to the nature of the vulnerability.
*   PAN-OS versions 8.1, 9.0, 9.1, 10.0, and 10.1 are affected.
*   Prisma Access 2.1 Preferred and Innovation firewalls are affected, but 2.2 and later are not.

**Mitigation:**
*   Apply the software updates listed in the advisory.
*   Change the default master key, which is considered a security best practice for PAN-OS and Prisma Access customers.
*   Remove SCEP profiles configured in the firewall configuration.
*   Enable Unique Threat ID 91526 on traffic destined for GlobalProtect interfaces to detect attacks.
