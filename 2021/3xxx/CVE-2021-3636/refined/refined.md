    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The injected service-ca.crt file in OpenShift, before version 4.8, incorrectly contained additional internal CAs. This was due to the way service account tokens were mounted into pods prior to OpenShift 4.8 which included the extra CAs.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Incorrect inclusion of additional CAs in the service-ca.crt file"
      ],

       "additional_notes": "The fix in OpenShift 4.8 implemented a new way to mount service account tokens via projected volumes, which do not include the extra CAs.  A patch for OCP 4.8 is available via RHSA-2021:2437.  This vulnerability has a 'moderate' impact rating. The vulnerability is fixed in OpenShift 4.8.2.  This vulnerability is not fixed in OpenShift 4.7 and 4.6 as they are in maintenance support, however a fix can be requested through a support ticket."
