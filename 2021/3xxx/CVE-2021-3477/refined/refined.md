Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3477:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The Debian LTS advisory (DLA 3236-1) and the Gentoo security advisory explicitly mention `CVE-2021-3477` as a vulnerability fixed in their respective `openexr` package updates.
   - The Red Hat Bugzilla entry also lists `CVE-2021-3477` as the subject of the bug.
   - The commit message from GitHub references "Fix overflow computing deeptile sample table size" which aligns with the vulnerability description.
   - Therefore, all provided content is relevant to `CVE-2021-3477`.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the calculation of the deep tile sample table size. Specifically, the multiplication of `_data->tileDesc.ySize` and `_data->tileDesc.xSize` within `ImfDeepTiledInputFile::initialize()` could result in an integer overflow, leading to a smaller-than-expected memory allocation for the sample count table.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Integer Overflow:** An integer overflow occurs during the calculation of the size needed for the sample count table. The multiplication of tile dimensions (x and y) is not checked for overflow and can wrap around to a smaller value.
    *  **Heap-based buffer overflow**: A heap buffer overflow vulnerability is present within Imf\_2\_5::DeepTiledInputFile::readPixelSampleCounts.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The most immediate impact of the vulnerability is a potential denial of service through application crash. The buffer overflow resulting from the incorrect memory allocation could lead to a crash while processing a crafted image.
    *   **Out-of-bounds read:** An integer overflow can lead to an out-of-bounds read in DeepTiledInputFile::readPixelSampleCounts().
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The Gentoo advisory notes the worst-case scenario: "arbitrary execution of code", which could be possible through further exploitation of the memory corruption.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered when processing a malformed or crafted OpenEXR image file.
    *   The attacker could exploit this by providing a specially crafted OpenEXR file containing specific tile dimensions that cause an integer overflow during sample count table allocation.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to supply a crafted OpenEXR file to the vulnerable application or system.
    *   The attacker does not need to be in a privileged position, since the vulnerability exists in the file parsing process.

**3. Additional Notes:**

*   The GitHub commit message provides a specific fix location: `src/lib/OpenEXR/ImfDeepTiledInputFile.cpp`.
*   The fix involves casting tile dimensions to `size_t` before multiplication, preventing integer overflow.
* The fix also appears to include a memory size limit when reading files with deep scanlines, preventing an excessive memory allocation.
*   The fix is present in OpenEXR versions `v2.5.4`, `v2.5.5`, `v3.0.1`, `v2.4.3` and beyond according to the provided information, with a backport to `v2.2.0-11+deb9u3` in Debian 9 Stretch.
*   The Gentoo advisory also includes multiple other CVEs, which indicates that multiple vulnerabilities exist within OpenEXR, many leading to denial of service situations.
* The vulnerability exists in the C++ API, within the core library.
* Several sources mention the vulnerability was found through fuzzing.

In summary, CVE-2021-3477 is a heap buffer overflow vulnerability rooted in an integer overflow in the calculation of the deep tile sample table size. It can cause a denial of service and potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited in an OpenEXR image processing application. The vulnerability is triggered by malformed OpenEXR files, and the fix involves preventing the integer overflow with explicit casting to `size_t`.
