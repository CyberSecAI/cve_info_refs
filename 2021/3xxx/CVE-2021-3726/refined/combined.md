fix(lib): fix potential command injection in `title` and `spectrum` f…

…unctions

The `title` function unsafely prints its input without sanitization, which if used
with custom user code that calls it, it could trigger command injection.

The `spectrum_ls` and `spectrum_bls` could similarly be exploited if a variable is
changed in the user's shell environment with a carefully crafted value. This is
highly unlikely to occur (and if possible, other methods would be used instead),
but with this change the exploit of these two functions is now impossible.
