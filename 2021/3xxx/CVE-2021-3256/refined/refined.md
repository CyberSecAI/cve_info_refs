Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `chakanhtml.module.php` file where the `html_url` parameter is not properly sanitized. This allows for arbitrary file read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** The lack of input validation on the `html_url` parameter allows an attacker to specify a file path, leading to the ability to read sensitive files from the server.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper filtering or sanitization of the `html_url` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read arbitrary files, including configuration files (`caches/config.php`) which may contain database credentials and other sensitive information.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Knowledge gained from reading configuration files can be used to further compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a POST request to `/index.php` with specific parameters including the vulnerable `html_url` parameter.
*   **`html_url` Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker provides a file path as the value of the `html_url` parameter to access the file they desire.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Background Login Required:** The attacker needs to be logged into the admin panel of the application to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of the Application's Structure:** An attacker needs to know the structure of the application and potentially some of the file paths, such as configuration file locations to exploit the vulnerability effectively.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code resides in `chakanhtml.module.php`.
*   The specific POST request for the exploit is shown as part of the proof of concept (PoC) provided by the reporter and highlights the `html_url` parameter containing the file path and the other required parameter for the request:
