Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-3914:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The smallrye health metrics UI component did not properly sanitize user inputs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could conduct cross-site scripting attacks. This typically allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the UI
    - Phishing attacks
    - Information theft

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through user-provided inputs that are not properly sanitized by the smallrye health metrics UI component.
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the UI through these unsanitized inputs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide or manipulate user inputs that are processed by the vulnerable UI component.
- The attacker would need to craft malicious input that would be stored and then executed within a user's session when that input is displayed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was found in the smallrye-health-ui component.
- The issue is addressed in Red Hat build of Quarkus 2.7.5 and was fixed via RHSA-2022:4623.
