The provided content is a GitHub issue related to the Bitcoin Core project, specifically issue #20866 titled "Restrict RPCs that make server-side files." While the issue discusses a potential vulnerability related to RPC calls and file system access, it does not correspond to CVE-2021-3195.

The issue describes that RPC calls such as `dumpwallet` can create files anywhere on the server's filesystem, limited only by the permissions of the user running `bitcoind`. This could potentially lead to vulnerabilities.

The suggested solution involves restricting these RPC calls to the data directory, or a specific directory within it.

This issue is a vulnerability related to file system access controls and not a specific exploit, hence this is not related to a specific CVE number.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of restriction on where RPC calls can create files on the server's file system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Insecure file handling by RPC calls. The `dumpwallet` RPC and potentially others, have the ability to write files outside of a designated safe location.

**Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user or compromised server process could create/overwrite files anywhere accessible to the user running `bitcoind`, potentially leading to data corruption, information leakage or denial of service by consuming storage capacity.

**Attack vectors:** Attacker would need to be able to access RPC interface via a compromised system or through exploitation of Bitcoin Core.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs the ability to execute arbitrary RPC calls and write to the filesystem. This is possible by either gaining access to a running `bitcoind` instance, or exploiting another vulnerability allowing remote code execution.

Based on the above analysis, the content is not related to CVE-2021-3195, therefore the response is:

**UNRELATED**
