- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation in the GlobalProtect app's Windows kernel driver, which can lead to an uncaught exception when processing specially crafted input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20), Uncaught Exception (CWE-248)
- **Impact of exploitation**: A limited Windows user can trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by sending crafted input to the GlobalProtect app, resulting in a Windows blue screen of death (BSOD) error.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring a local user to send specific input to the vulnerable GlobalProtect app.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a local account on the Windows system. No special privileges are required, a low privilege account is sufficient.
