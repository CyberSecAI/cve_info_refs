- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A memory corruption vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect portal and gateway interfaces.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated network-based attacker can disrupt system processes and potentially execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks targeting the GlobalProtect portal and gateway interfaces.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have network access to the GlobalProtect interface.
