### @achow101 **[achow101](/achow101)** commented [Aug 9, 2019](#issue-479142385)

QApplication takes the command line arguments and parses them itself for some [built in command line arguments](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qapplication.html#QApplication) that it has. We don't want any of those built in arguments, so instead give it dummy arguments.

To test, you can use the `-reverse` option. Without this patch, everything will appear right-to-left; things that were on the left side will be on the right and everything is right aligned.

After this patch, `-reverse` will now give a startup error since we do not support this argument.

Sorry, something went wrong.

My suggestion is to make the constructor private and add a `static BitcoinApplication::create()` where you could declare a ~~temporary~~ static argc and argv and the app.

That requires a copy constructor, and `QApplication` does not have one. Qt explicitly does not want things to be copied.

| --- | --- |
|  | static char qt\_arg[] = "bitcoin-qt"; |

Eh, whatever you do, please don't copy around QApplication objects, even if you could. It's a singleton.

It's also definitely not necessary to solve this.

| How about this  Results in a segfault.   ---   FWIW, making the `argv` const and then casting it is how `QCoreApplication` [does it internally](https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtbase.git/tree/src/corelib/kernel/qcoreapplication.cpp#n464) when you say `argc` is 0. The only reason that I did not choose to just do `QApplication(0, 0)` is because it results in the warning `QSettings::value: Empty key passed` being printed a couple of times (at least for me using KDE, this might actually just be a KDE thing). |

| [@achow101](https://github.com/achow101) ~~But why add the const at all if you're going to cast it away?~~  Edit: oh, because of the string constant. I get it, the *string* is read-only, which is fine, Qt is not going to change the contents of arguments, but the *array* needs to be writable as it might remove arguments. |

a2714a5c69f0b0506689af04c3e785f71ee0915d Give QApplication dummy arguments (Andrew Chow)

Pull request description:

  QApplication takes the command line arguments and parses them itself for some [built in command line arguments](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qapplication.html#QApplication) that it has. We don't want any of those built in arguments, so instead give it dummy arguments.

  To test, you can use the `-reverse` option. Without this patch, everything will appear right-to-left; things that were on the left side will be on the right and everything is right aligned.

| This also breaks the URI handler on macOS, but *only* when opening from the command line, not when opening from a browser. See [#17025](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17025). |

Summary:
a2714a5c69f0b0506689af04c3e785f71ee0915d Give QApplication dummy arguments (Andrew Chow)

Pull request description:

  QApplication takes the command line arguments and parses them itself for some [built in command line arguments](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qapplication.html#QApplication) that it has. We don't want any of those built in arguments, so instead give it dummy arguments.

  To test, you can use the `-reverse` option. Without this patch, everything will appear right-to-left; things that were on the left side will be on the right and everything is right aligned.

  After this patch, `-reverse` will now give a startup error since we do not support this argument.

| Disclosure of the vulnerability this PR fixes: <https://achow101.com/2021/02/0.18-uri-vuln>  A possible followup now that this is public would be to explicitly allow safe Qt arguments instead of flatly disabling all of them. |

a2714a5c69f0b0506689af04c3e785f71ee0915d Give QApplication dummy arguments (Andrew Chow)

Pull request description:

  QApplication takes the command line arguments and parses them itself for some [built in command line arguments](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qapplication.html#QApplication) that it has. We don't want any of those built in arguments, so instead give it dummy arguments.

  To test, you can use the `-reverse` option. Without this patch, everything will appear right-to-left; things that were on the left side will be on the right and everything is right aligned.

  After this patch, `-reverse` will now give a startup error since we do not support this argument.

Discards any Qt built-in command line arguments and replaces them with dummy argv that only contains the binary name. Solves [#2665](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/2665) / [CVE-2021-3401](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rvfw-vc72-c8w8 "CVE-2021-3401").

Manually ported from [bitcoin/bitcoin@a2714a5c](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/a2714a5c)

Contains a repetition of the consts in `qt/test/test_main.cpp` because we do not have the class extraction from qt/bitcoin.cpp into qt/bitcoin.h yet - I toyed with doing that but there's a number of things we'd need in that case, and this simple fix is more straight-forward. We can clean this up further with 1.14.6

Verified that this fixes the vulnerability on Intel MacOS Big Sur.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| To test: take a [v1.14.4](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/releases/tag/v1.14.4) for your platform and run the executable from a terminal / command prompt, with a Dogecoin and a QT parameter, eg:  ``` dogecoin-qt[.exe] -testnet -reverse  ```  This will show a reversed screen layout.  then take an archive [from the CI artifacts of this PR](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/actions/runs/1417618397#artifacts) for your platform and run the same command with that executable. Now the screen layout should NOT be reversed. |

| We recently found and confirmed that Ravencoin Core in the **latest release** (version `4.3.2.1`) and earlier versions are affected by a [remote code execution vulnerability in Qt5-based GUI apps](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qt5-based-gui-apps-susceptible-to-remote-code-execution/). Specifically, the `QApplication` in `Qt` framework used by the **Ravencoin GUI Program** will parse `Qt built-in` arguments, such as `-reverse` and `-platformpluginpath` (see the document [here](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qapplication.html#QApplication)).  For example, when you start the `raven-qt.exe` program in command line and then append a built-in argument, such as `-reverse`, e.g., `"C:\Program Files\Ravecoin\bin\raven-qt.exe" raven:address -reverse`, you will get a reverse Ravencoin GUI.  For more details, you may also refer to the following pages.   * The vulnerable code in Ravencoin: `src/qt/raven.cpp`, see [line 367 to 373](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/blob/master/src/qt/raven.cpp#L367-L373). * Similar fix from Bitcoin: [PR#16578](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16578). * The original [CVE-2021-3401](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3401) report * The exploited [details](https://achow101.com/2021/02/0.18-uri-vuln).   Reported by `de957ad9679f28a38f02f00cc7928bce8fb424882ff060a3c09c32895b1474cc`.

| Thank you CharesFang and fdov for your contributions  For clarification and to prevent unnecessary panic- As I understand this:  -This bug allows someone locally on your computer (Windows, Mac, Linux) to launch raven-qt with some strange display behavior, like a GUI in which left and right alignments work backwards. Theoretically, there might also be a way to use this bug locally to get raven-qt/ravend to do some non-display bad behavior from the command-line, but the raven-qt/ravend code is designed to prevent that. So even for someone with local rights on your system, this isn't too awful. Remotely, it's even less of a threat.  -On MacOS and Linux, there is no remote threat at all because of the way they handle command line arguments.  -On Windows, it is possible to use this from a remote location (like loading a web page) to create the strange behavior described above if your browser allows it, but none of the major browsers allow it.  -So bottom line is that this should be fixed to improve security in case some hacker finds a new way to use it. But it currently is harmless. |

* backport: Shut down if trying to connect a corrupted block (#1126)

Manual backport of bitcoin#0e7c52dc6cbb8fd881a0dd57a6167a812fe71dc4

Fixes issue #1087

Commit message by author sdaftuar:
The call to CheckBlock() in ConnectBlock() is redundant with calls to it
prior to storing a block on disk. If CheckBlock() fails with an error
indicating the block is potentially corrupted, then shut down
immediately, as this is an indication that the node is experiencing
hardware issues.  (If we didn't shut down, we could go into an infinite
loop trying to reconnect this same bad block, as we're not setting the
block's status to FAILED in the case where there is potential
corruption.)

If CheckBlock() fails for some other reason, we'll end up flagging this
block as bad (perhaps some prior software version \"let a bad block in\",
as the comment indicates), and not trying to connect it again, so this
case should be properly handled.

* backport: [validation] Crash if disconnecting a block fails (#1159)

Manual backport of bitcoin PR 15305

If we're unable to disconnect a block during normal operation, then that is a
failure of our local system (such as disk failure) or the chain that we are on
(eg CVE-2018-17144), but cannot be due to failure of the (more work) chain that
we're trying to validate.

We should abort rather than stay on a less work chain.

* backport: gui: Set CConnman byte counters earlier to avoid uninitialized reads (#1161)

Manual backport of bitcoin PR #17906

Initialize CConnman byte counters during construction, so GetTotalBytesRecv()
and GetTotalBytesSent() methods don't return garbage before Start() is called.

Change shouldn't have any effect outside of the GUI. It just fixes a race
condition during a qt test that was observed on travis:

rpc: Fix data race (UB) in InterruptRPC()

* backport: fix uninitialized read when stringifying an addrLocal (#1163)

Manual backport of bitcoin PR 14728

Reachable from either place where SetIP is used when our best-guess
addrLocal for a peer is IPv4, but the peer tells us it's reaching us at
an IPv6 address.

In that case, SetIP turns an IPv4 address into an IPv6 address without
setting the scopeId, which is subsequently read in GetSockAddr during
CNetAddr::ToStringIP and passed to getnameinfo. Fix by ensuring every
constructor initializes the scopeId field with something.

* backport: Introduce a maximum size for locators. (#1164)

Manual backport of bitcoin PR #13907

The largest sensible size for a locator is log in the number of blocks.
 But, as noted by Coinr8d on BCT a maximum size message could encode a
 hundred thousand locators.  If height were used to limit the messages
 that could open new attacks where peers on long low diff forks would
 get disconnected and end up stuck.

Ideally, nodes first first learn to limit the size of locators they
 send before limiting what would be processed, but common implementations
 back off with an exponent of 2 and have an implicit limit of 2^32
 blocks, so they already cannot produce locators over some size.

This sets the limit to an absurdly high amount of 101 in order to
 maximize compatibility with existing software.

* Fix mining bug - lockup in CreateNewBlock loop

This bug was discovered in Dec-2021 when two blocks were mined within one second.
Pool operators locked up and required restarting.

It happened because when CheckTxInputs finds a double spend, ConnectBlock fails but
didn't mark the bad txn to be flushed from the mempool.

Manual backport of bitcoin#0e7c52dc6cbb8fd881a0dd57a6167a812fe71dc4

Fixes issue #1087

Commit message by author sdaftuar:
The call to CheckBlock() in ConnectBlock() is redundant with calls to it
prior to storing a block on disk. If CheckBlock() fails with an error
indicating the block is potentially corrupted, then shut down
immediately, as this is an indication that the node is experiencing
hardware issues.  (If we didn't shut down, we could go into an infinite
loop trying to reconnect this same bad block, as we're not setting the
block's status to FAILED in the case where there is potential
corruption.)

If CheckBlock() fails for some other reason, we'll end up flagging this
block as bad (perhaps some prior software version \"let a bad block in\",
as the comment indicates), and not trying to connect it again, so this
case should be properly handled.

Manual backport of bitcoin PR 15305

If we're unable to disconnect a block during normal operation, then that is a
failure of our local system (such as disk failure) or the chain that we are on
(eg CVE-2018-17144), but cannot be due to failure of the (more work) chain that
we're trying to validate.

We should abort rather than stay on a less work chain.

* backport: fix uninitialized read when stringifying an addrLocal (#1163)

Manual backport of bitcoin PR 14728

Reachable from either place where SetIP is used when our best-guess
addrLocal for a peer is IPv4, but the peer tells us it's reaching us at
an IPv6 address.

In that case, SetIP turns an IPv4 address into an IPv6 address without
setting the scopeId, which is subsequently read in GetSockAddr during
CNetAddr::ToStringIP and passed to getnameinfo. Fix by ensuring every
constructor initializes the scopeId field with something.

* backport: Introduce a maximum size for locators. (#1164)

Manual backport of bitcoin PR #13907

The largest sensible size for a locator is log in the number of blocks.
 But, as noted by Coinr8d on BCT a maximum size message could encode a
 hundred thousand locators.  If height were used to limit the messages
 that could open new attacks where peers on long low diff forks would
 get disconnected and end up stuck.

Ideally, nodes first first learn to limit the size of locators they
 send before limiting what would be processed, but common implementations
 back off with an exponent of 2 and have an implicit limit of 2^32
 blocks, so they already cannot produce locators over some size.

This sets the limit to an absurdly high amount of 101 in order to
 maximize compatibility with existing software.

The call to CheckBlock() in ConnectBlock() is redundant with calls to it
prior to storing a block on disk. If CheckBlock() fails with an error

If CheckBlock() fails for some other reason, we'll end up flagging this

* gui: minimum sizes and margins ([#1133](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/pull/1133))

* Increase minimum window size to 1024x700
    * Adjust layouts most pages, to be usable at the new minimum window size.
    * Most marings are reduced.

* gui: search for string in whole asset name. ([#1134](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/pull/1134))

* AssetFilterProxy expanded to be able to search
      for strings in the whole asset name.
      Previously only the prefix was searchable.

* gui: Create Assets tooltip wording ([#1138](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/pull/1138))

Remove 'main/sub/unique' from the tooltip.
    The list was incomplete, and adding everything would make it too long.

* backport: [validation] Crash if disconnecting a block fails ([#1159](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/pull/1159))

Manual backport of bitcoin PR 15305

If we're unable to disconnect a block during normal operation, then that is a
failure of our local system (such as disk failure) or the chain that we are on
(eg [CVE-2018-17144](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-35hw-99vw-mgp5 "CVE-2018-17144")), but cannot be due to failure of the (more work) chain that
we're trying to validate.

We should abort rather than stay on a less work chain.

* backport: wallet: Fix Char as Bool in Wallet ([#1160](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/pull/1160))

Manual backport of bitcoin PR #16572

* backport: gui: Set CConnman byte counters earlier to avoid uninitialized reads ([#1161](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/pull/1161))

Manual backport of bitcoin PR #17906

Initialize CConnman byte counters during construction, so GetTotalBytesRecv()
and GetTotalBytesSent() methods don't return garbage before Start() is called.

Change shouldn't have any effect outside of the GUI. It just fixes a race
condition during a qt test that was observed on travis:

* backport: rpc: Fix data race (UB) in InterruptRPC() ([#1162](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/pull/1162))

manual backport of bitcoin PR # 14993

rpc: Fix data race (UB) in InterruptRPC()

* backport: fix uninitialized read when stringifying an addrLocal ([#1163](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/pull/1163))

Manual backport of bitcoin PR 14728

Reachable from either place where SetIP is used when our best-guess
addrLocal for a peer is IPv4, but the peer tells us it's reaching us at
an IPv6 address.

In that case, SetIP turns an IPv4 address into an IPv6 address without
setting the scopeId, which is subsequently read in GetSockAddr during
CNetAddr::ToStringIP and passed to getnameinfo. Fix by ensuring every
constructor initializes the scopeId field with something.

* backport: Introduce a maximum size for locators. ([#1164](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/pull/1164))

Manual backport of bitcoin PR #13907

The largest sensible size for a locator is log in the number of blocks.
 But, as noted by Coinr8d on BCT a maximum size message could encode a
 hundred thousand locators.  If height were used to limit the messages
 that could open new attacks where peers on long low diff forks would
 get disconnected and end up stuck.

Ideally, nodes first first learn to limit the size of locators they
 send before limiting what would be processed, but common implementations
 back off with an exponent of 2 and have an implicit limit of 2^32
 blocks, so they already cannot produce locators over some size.

This sets the limit to an absurdly high amount of 101 in order to
 maximize compatibility with existing software.

* Fix mining bug - lockup in CreateNewBlock loop

This bug was discovered in Dec-2021 when two blocks were mined within one second.
Pool operators locked up and required restarting.

It happened because when CheckTxInputs finds a double spend, ConnectBlock fails but
didn't mark the bad txn to be flushed from the mempool.

## Description

Bitcoin Core before 0.19.0 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code when another application unsafely passes the -platformpluginpath argument to the bitcoin-qt program, as demonstrated by an x-scheme-handler/bitcoin handler for a .desktop file or a web browser. NOTE: the discoverer states "I believe that this vulnerability cannot actually be exploited."

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Manual backport of bitcoin#0e7c52dc6cbb8fd881a0dd57a6167a812fe71dc4

Fixes issue #1087

Commit message by author sdaftuar:
The call to CheckBlock() in ConnectBlock() is redundant with calls to it
prior to storing a block on disk. If CheckBlock() fails with an error
indicating the block is potentially corrupted, then shut down
immediately, as this is an indication that the node is experiencing
hardware issues.  (If we didn't shut down, we could go into an infinite
loop trying to reconnect this same bad block, as we're not setting the
block's status to FAILED in the case where there is potential
corruption.)

If CheckBlock() fails for some other reason, we'll end up flagging this
block as bad (perhaps some prior software version \"let a bad block in\",
as the comment indicates), and not trying to connect it again, so this
case should be properly handled.

* backport: [validation] Crash if disconnecting a block fails (#1159)

Manual backport of bitcoin PR 15305

If we're unable to disconnect a block during normal operation, then that is a
failure of our local system (such as disk failure) or the chain that we are on
(eg CVE-2018-17144), but cannot be due to failure of the (more work) chain that
we're trying to validate.

We should abort rather than stay on a less work chain.

Manual backport of bitcoin PR #17906

and GetTotalBytesSent() methods don't return garbage before Start() is called.

Change shouldn't have any effect outside of the GUI. It just fixes a race
condition during a qt test that was observed on travis:

* backport: fix uninitialized read when stringifying an addrLocal (#1163)

Manual backport of bitcoin PR 14728

Reachable from either place where SetIP is used when our best-guess
addrLocal for a peer is IPv4, but the peer tells us it's reaching us at
an IPv6 address.

In that case, SetIP turns an IPv4 address into an IPv6 address without
setting the scopeId, which is subsequently read in GetSockAddr during
CNetAddr::ToStringIP and passed to getnameinfo. Fix by ensuring every
constructor initializes the scopeId field with something.

* backport: Introduce a maximum size for locators. (#1164)

Manual backport of bitcoin PR #13907

The largest sensible size for a locator is log in the number of blocks.
 But, as noted by Coinr8d on BCT a maximum size message could encode a
 hundred thousand locators.  If height were used to limit the messages
 that could open new attacks where peers on long low diff forks would
 get disconnected and end up stuck.

Ideally, nodes first first learn to limit the size of locators they
 send before limiting what would be processed, but common implementations
 back off with an exponent of 2 and have an implicit limit of 2^32
 blocks, so they already cannot produce locators over some size.

This sets the limit to an absurdly high amount of 101 in order to
 maximize compatibility with existing software.

Manual backport of bitcoin#0e7c52dc6cbb8fd881a0dd57a6167a812fe71dc4

Fixes issue [#1087](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/issues/1087)

Commit message by author sdaftuar:
The call to CheckBlock() in ConnectBlock() is redundant with calls to it
prior to storing a block on disk. If CheckBlock() fails with an error
indicating the block is potentially corrupted, then shut down
immediately, as this is an indication that the node is experiencing
hardware issues.  (If we didn't shut down, we could go into an infinite
loop trying to reconnect this same bad block, as we're not setting the
block's status to FAILED in the case where there is potential
corruption.)

If CheckBlock() fails for some other reason, we'll end up flagging this
block as bad (perhaps some prior software version "let a bad block in",
as the comment indicates), and not trying to connect it again, so this
case should be properly handled.

* backport: [validation] Crash if disconnecting a block fails ([#1159](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/pull/1159))

Manual backport of bitcoin PR 15305

If we're unable to disconnect a block during normal operation, then that is a
failure of our local system (such as disk failure) or the chain that we are on
(eg [CVE-2018-17144](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-35hw-99vw-mgp5 "CVE-2018-17144")), but cannot be due to failure of the (more work) chain that
we're trying to validate.

We should abort rather than stay on a less work chain.

Manual backport of bitcoin PR #17906

Initialize CConnman byte counters during construction, so GetTotalBytesRecv()
and GetTotalBytesSent() methods don't return garbage before Start() is called.

condition during a qt test that was observed on travis:

* backport: fix uninitialized read when stringifying an addrLocal ([#1163](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/pull/1163))

Manual backport of bitcoin PR 14728

Reachable from either place where SetIP is used when our best-guess
addrLocal for a peer is IPv4, but the peer tells us it's reaching us at
an IPv6 address.

In that case, SetIP turns an IPv4 address into an IPv6 address without
setting the scopeId, which is subsequently read in GetSockAddr during
CNetAddr::ToStringIP and passed to getnameinfo. Fix by ensuring every
constructor initializes the scopeId field with something.

* backport: Introduce a maximum size for locators. ([#1164](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/pull/1164))

Manual backport of bitcoin PR #13907

The largest sensible size for a locator is log in the number of blocks.
 But, as noted by Coinr8d on BCT a maximum size message could encode a
 hundred thousand locators.  If height were used to limit the messages
 that could open new attacks where peers on long low diff forks would
 get disconnected and end up stuck.

Ideally, nodes first first learn to limit the size of locators they
 send before limiting what would be processed, but common implementations
 back off with an exponent of 2 and have an implicit limit of 2^32
 blocks, so they already cannot produce locators over some size.

This sets the limit to an absurdly high amount of 101 in order to
 maximize compatibility with existing software.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That‚Äôs why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don‚Äôt and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world‚Äôs most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot‚Äôs best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ‚Äúcopy/paste‚Äù?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot‚Äôs suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not ‚Äúcopying and pasting‚Äù from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor‚Äîfocusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also¬† adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot¬† throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization‚Äôs codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer‚Äôs knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

#### Plans & Pricing

#### What are the differences between the Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise.

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub‚Äôs model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub‚Äôs Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub‚Äôs retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features‚Äô effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot‚Äôs suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here‚Äôs some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:¬† Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot‚Äôs AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub‚Äôs public repositories‚Äîwhich are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub‚Äôs research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub‚Äôs AI model. Again, Copilot does not ‚Äúlook up‚Äù or ‚Äúcopy and paste‚Äù code, but is instead using context from a user‚Äôs workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot‚Äôs model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there‚Äôs a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories‚Äîincluding ones without licenses‚Äîthat code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don‚Äôt determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‚Äòfunctional‚Äô instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we‚Äôve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It‚Äôs not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called ‚ÄúCopilot‚Äù not ‚ÄúAutopilot‚Äù and it‚Äôs not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot‚Äôs suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses ‚Äì rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. ‚Äì you should continue these policies with Copilot‚Äôs suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot‚Äôs suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You‚Äôre entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot‚Äôs filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot‚Äôs ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That‚Äôs why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don‚Äôt and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world‚Äôs most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot‚Äôs best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ‚Äúcopy/paste‚Äù?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot‚Äôs suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not ‚Äúcopying and pasting‚Äù from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor‚Äîfocusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub‚Äôs model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub‚Äôs Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub‚Äôs retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features‚Äô effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot‚Äôs suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here‚Äôs some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:¬† Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models.

Fixes issue [#1110](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/issues/1110) - [CVE-2021-3401](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rvfw-vc72-c8w8 "CVE-2021-3401")

Backport of [bitcoin/bitcoin@a2714a5c](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/a2714a5c)

Exact same solution as: [dogecoin/dogecoin#2666](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/2666)

Fix is tested on Linux.

Sorry, something went wrong.

* backport: Shut down if trying to connect a corrupted block (#1126)

Manual backport of bitcoin#0e7c52dc6cbb8fd881a0dd57a6167a812fe71dc4

Fixes issue #1087

Commit message by author sdaftuar:
The call to CheckBlock() in ConnectBlock() is redundant with calls to it
prior to storing a block on disk. If CheckBlock() fails with an error
indicating the block is potentially corrupted, then shut down
immediately, as this is an indication that the node is experiencing
hardware issues.  (If we didn't shut down, we could go into an infinite
loop trying to reconnect this same bad block, as we're not setting the
block's status to FAILED in the case where there is potential
corruption.)

If CheckBlock() fails for some other reason, we'll end up flagging this
block as bad (perhaps some prior software version \"let a bad block in\",
as the comment indicates), and not trying to connect it again, so this
case should be properly handled.

* backport: [validation] Crash if disconnecting a block fails (#1159)

Manual backport of bitcoin PR 15305

If we're unable to disconnect a block during normal operation, then that is a
failure of our local system (such as disk failure) or the chain that we are on
(eg CVE-2018-17144), but cannot be due to failure of the (more work) chain that
we're trying to validate.

We should abort rather than stay on a less work chain.

Manual backport of bitcoin PR #17906

Initialize CConnman byte counters during construction, so GetTotalBytesRecv()
and GetTotalBytesSent() methods don't return garbage before Start() is called.

Change shouldn't have any effect outside of the GUI. It just fixes a race
condition during a qt test that was observed on travis:

rpc: Fix data race (UB) in InterruptRPC()

* backport: fix uninitialized read when stringifying an addrLocal (#1163)

Manual backport of bitcoin PR 14728

Reachable from either place where SetIP is used when our best-guess
addrLocal for a peer is IPv4, but the peer tells us it's reaching us at
an IPv6 address.

In that case, SetIP turns an IPv4 address into an IPv6 address without
setting the scopeId, which is subsequently read in GetSockAddr during
CNetAddr::ToStringIP and passed to getnameinfo. Fix by ensuring every
constructor initializes the scopeId field with something.

* backport: Introduce a maximum size for locators. (#1164)

Manual backport of bitcoin PR #13907

The largest sensible size for a locator is log in the number of blocks.
 But, as noted by Coinr8d on BCT a maximum size message could encode a
 hundred thousand locators.  If height were used to limit the messages
 that could open new attacks where peers on long low diff forks would
 get disconnected and end up stuck.

Ideally, nodes first first learn to limit the size of locators they
 send before limiting what would be processed, but common implementations
 back off with an exponent of 2 and have an implicit limit of 2^32
 blocks, so they already cannot produce locators over some size.

This sets the limit to an absurdly high amount of 101 in order to
 maximize compatibility with existing software.

This bug was discovered in Dec-2021 when two blocks were mined within one second.

Manual backport of bitcoin#0e7c52dc6cbb8fd881a0dd57a6167a812fe71dc4

Fixes issue #1087

Commit message by author sdaftuar:
The call to CheckBlock() in ConnectBlock() is redundant with calls to it
prior to storing a block on disk. If CheckBlock() fails with an error
indicating the block is potentially corrupted, then shut down
immediately, as this is an indication that the node is experiencing
hardware issues.  (If we didn't shut down, we could go into an infinite
loop trying to reconnect this same bad block, as we're not setting the
block's status to FAILED in the case where there is potential
corruption.)

If CheckBlock() fails for some other reason, we'll end up flagging this
block as bad (perhaps some prior software version \"let a bad block in\",
as the comment indicates), and not trying to connect it again, so this
case should be properly handled.

Manual backport of bitcoin PR 15305

If we're unable to disconnect a block during normal operation, then that is a
failure of our local system (such as disk failure) or the chain that we are on
(eg CVE-2018-17144), but cannot be due to failure of the (more work) chain that
we're trying to validate.

We should abort rather than stay on a less work chain.

* backport: fix uninitialized read when stringifying an addrLocal (#1163)

Manual backport of bitcoin PR 14728

Reachable from either place where SetIP is used when our best-guess
addrLocal for a peer is IPv4, but the peer tells us it's reaching us at
an IPv6 address.

In that case, SetIP turns an IPv4 address into an IPv6 address without
setting the scopeId, which is subsequently read in GetSockAddr during
CNetAddr::ToStringIP and passed to getnameinfo. Fix by ensuring every
constructor initializes the scopeId field with something.

* backport: Introduce a maximum size for locators. (#1164)

Manual backport of bitcoin PR #13907

The largest sensible size for a locator is log in the number of blocks.
 But, as noted by Coinr8d on BCT a maximum size message could encode a
 hundred thousand locators.  If height were used to limit the messages
 that could open new attacks where peers on long low diff forks would
 get disconnected and end up stuck.

Ideally, nodes first first learn to limit the size of locators they
 send before limiting what would be processed, but common implementations
 back off with an exponent of 2 and have an implicit limit of 2^32
 blocks, so they already cannot produce locators over some size.

This sets the limit to an absurdly high amount of 101 in order to
 maximize compatibility with existing software.

Manual backport of bitcoin#0e7c52dc6cbb8fd881a0dd57a6167a812fe71dc4

Fixes issue [#1087](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/issues/1087)

Commit message by author sdaftuar:
The call to CheckBlock() in ConnectBlock() is redundant with calls to it
prior to storing a block on disk. If CheckBlock() fails with an error
indicating the block is potentially corrupted, then shut down
immediately, as this is an indication that the node is experiencing
hardware issues.  (If we didn't shut down, we could go into an infinite
loop trying to reconnect this same bad block, as we're not setting the
block's status to FAILED in the case where there is potential
corruption.)

If CheckBlock() fails for some other reason, we'll end up flagging this
block as bad (perhaps some prior software version "let a bad block in",
as the comment indicates), and not trying to connect it again, so this
case should be properly handled.

* fixes [#1072](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/issues/1072) ([#1128](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/pull/1128))

* gui: optional seed extension word rename ([#1132](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/pull/1132))

* Re-word in the import dialog.
    * Passphrase is used multiple times, renaming this to Seed Extension Word.
    * Add better tooltip.

* Increase minimum window size to 1024x700
    * Adjust layouts most pages, to be usable at the new minimum window size.
    * Most marings are reduced.

* gui: search for string in whole asset name. ([#1134](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/pull/1134))

* AssetFilterProxy expanded to be able to search
      for strings in the whole asset name.

* gui: Create Assets tooltip wording ([#1138](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/pull/1138))

Remove 'main/sub/unique' from the tooltip.
    The list was incomplete, and adding everything would make it too long.

* backport: [validation] Crash if disconnecting a block fails ([#1159](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/pull/1159))

Manual backport of bitcoin PR 15305

If we're unable to disconnect a block during normal operation, then that is a
failure of our local system (such as disk failure) or the chain that we are on
(eg [CVE-2018-17144](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-35hw-99vw-mgp5 "CVE-2018-17144")), but cannot be due to failure of the (more work) chain that
we're trying to validate.

We should abort rather than stay on a less work chain.

* backport: wallet: Fix Char as Bool in Wallet ([#1160](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/pull/1160))

Manual backport of bitcoin PR #16572

* backport: gui: Set CConnman byte counters earlier to avoid uninitialized reads ([#1161](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/pull/1161))

Manual backport of bitcoin PR #17906

Initialize CConnman byte counters during construction, so GetTotalBytesRecv()
and GetTotalBytesSent() methods don't return garbage before Start() is called.

Change shouldn't have any effect outside of the GUI. It just fixes a race
condition during a qt test that was observed on travis:

* backport: rpc: Fix data race (UB) in InterruptRPC() ([#1162](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/pull/1162))

* backport: fix uninitialized read when stringifying an addrLocal ([#1163](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/pull/1163))

Manual backport of bitcoin PR 14728

Reachable from either place where SetIP is used when our best-guess
addrLocal for a peer is IPv4, but the peer tells us it's reaching us at
an IPv6 address.

In that case, SetIP turns an IPv4 address into an IPv6 address without
setting the scopeId, which is subsequently read in GetSockAddr during
CNetAddr::ToStringIP and passed to getnameinfo. Fix by ensuring every
constructor initializes the scopeId field with something.

* backport: Introduce a maximum size for locators. ([#1164](https://github.com/RavenProject/Ravencoin/pull/1164))

Manual backport of bitcoin PR #13907

The largest sensible size for a locator is log in the number of blocks.
 But, as noted by Coinr8d on BCT a maximum size message could encode a
 hundred thousand locators.  If height were used to limit the messages
 that could open new attacks where peers on long low diff forks would
 get disconnected and end up stuck.

Ideally, nodes first first learn to limit the size of locators they
 send before limiting what would be processed, but common implementations
 back off with an exponent of 2 and have an implicit limit of 2^32
 blocks, so they already cannot produce locators over some size.

This sets the limit to an absurdly high amount of 101 in order to
 maximize compatibility with existing software.

* Fix mining bug - lockup in CreateNewBlock loop

This bug was discovered in Dec-2021 when two blocks were mined within one second.
Pool operators locked up and required restarting.

It happened because when CheckTxInputs finds a double spend, ConnectBlock fails but
didn't mark the bad txn to be flushed from the mempool.

# Ava Chow

I am a developer, specializing in C++, Python, and rust, although I can do other stuff with programming and server maintenance and management.
Currently I am an engineer at [Blockstream](https://blockstream.com/).
I primarily work on, and am a maintainer of, the [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) and on the [Hardware Wallet Interface](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/hwi) projects.
My focus is on wallet functionality and interoperability between different wallet software.
I also perform [Guix builds (previously Gitian)](/2016/01/Gitian-builder) for Bitcoin Core and all build results can be found on my [Github fork of Bitcoin](https://github.com/achow101/bitcoin/releases).

Every Monday at 2 PM Eastern Time (America/New York Timezone), I livestream my work on Bitcoin Core and HWI on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/achow101/).

I am also the moderator of the [Technical Support](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=4.0) and [Development and Technical Discussion](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=6.0) sections of [Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org), as well as the [Bitcoin StackExchange](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/).

If you would like to support my work, please visit my [donations page](https://tip.achow101.com/).

## Projects

I have worked on many projects, all of which are open source and can be viewed in my [Github account](https://github.com/achow101).
Some of these projects are for myself and others projects commissioned by others.
Some of my projects involve modifying existing open source projects
Occasionally I also contribute to other open source projects that I use either personally or as a dependency of my other work.

# URI Argument Injection Vulnerability in Bitcoin Core 0.18 and Earlier

# URI Argument Injection Vulnerability in Bitcoin Core 0.18 and Earlier

This article describes an URI Argument Injection vulnerability discovered in Bitcoin Core 0.18 and earlier.
The vulnerability was fixed in Bitcoin Core 0.19.0.
Bitcoin Core 0.19.0 and later are not vulnerable.
This vulnerability only affects Windows and Linux.

## Background

In 2019, I was browsing the [pwnie award nominations](https://web.archive.org/web/20190808154342/https%3A//pwnies.com/nominations/) and found an entry titled √¢¬Ä¬úRCE in Qt5-Based GUI Apps.√¢¬Ä¬ù
As Bitcoin Core√¢¬Ä¬ôs GUI (`bitcoin-qt`) uses Qt5, this immediately piqued my interest.
The [linked article](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qt5-based-gui-apps-susceptible-to-remote-code-execution/) describes a vulnerability in multiple Qt5 based software could have malicious code executed on a user√¢¬Ä¬ôs computer after clicking a malicious URI.
I proceeded to investigate whether this same vulnerability affects and found that it was theoretically possible.
However it seems that this vulnerability is unlikely to actually be exploited.

## URI Handlers

Understanding this vulnerability first requires that we understand how URIs are handled.
Windows and Linux handles this in a similar manner.
MacOS handles URIs differently so it is not affected by this vulnerability.

In Windows, the operating system executes a pre-registered command with the URI as an argument.
This command is stored in the Windows registry and contains format specifiers for the location within in the command to insert the URI.
Windows replaces the format specifier `%1` with the URI and then executes the command string.
For Bitcoin Core, the registry key is

```
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\bitcoin\shell\open\command

```

and the command is

```
"C:\Program Files\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt.exe" "%1"

```

In Linux, the desktop environment searches for a `.desktop` file which contains a line like `MimeType=x-scheme-handler/bitcoin`.
It then executes the command specified by the `Exec=` line.
A common `.desktop` file for Linux has:

```
Exec=bitcoin-qt %u

```

This command is, like Windows, a string with format specifiers.
The desktop environment will replace the format specifier `%u` with the URI and execute the command string.

## URI Argument Injection

Since URI handling in both Windows and Linux basically amounts to creating a string containing the URI and then executing it, a maliciously crafted URI could make the string such that it looks like a command with additional command line arguments.
For example, consider the URI `bitcoin:BC1QXUFYM7NNUSQZW9R2U5G98USKDAT7XQN4VYZ63S" "-argument`.
With the Window√¢¬Ä¬ôs URI command, the simple string replacement it does would create the command

```
"C:\Program Files\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt.exe" "bitcoin:BC1QXUFYM7NNUSQZW9R2U5G98USKDAT7XQN4VYZ63S" "-argument"

```

Notice how this looks like the URI is followed by a command line argument `-argument`.
In fact, it not only looks like that, it is interpreted by the OS that way and `-argument` is provided to the software as a separate command line argument instead of as part of the URI as it should be.
In this way, a malicious URI could cause the software to start with a dangerous command line argument.

## Injecting Arguments into Bitcoin Core

Since URI argument injection is a known issue, software developers have ways to avoid them.
Bitcoin Core√¢¬Ä¬ôs argument parser ignores any arguments that follow a URI.
So it is not possible to use inject Bitcoin Core specific arguments through a URI.
However, as noted earlier, the problem is with Qt.

The Qt framework specifies a set of Qt specific command line arguments.
When Qt is initialized, the command line arguments are be passed into Qt in order for those arguments to be processed by Qt.
This is done before Bitcoin Core processes the command line arguments.
Qt will look through the argument list, find the arguments it can handle, and remove them from the list as it handle them.
Then the arguments get passed to Bitcoin Core√¢¬Ä¬ôs argument parser.
This processing by Qt does not recognize URIs and will process any arguments regardless of their position in the arguments list.
Thus it is possible to use a URI to inject Qt specific arguments.

## Dangerous Command Line Arguments

Most of the Qt arguments are benign and [Qt√¢¬Ä¬ôs documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qguiapplication.html#supported-command-line-options) specifies the available arguments.
These arguments primarily affect the way that the application looks.
However there is one specific argument that is problematic: `-platformpluginpath`.
`-platformpluginpath` loads some plugin from a path and executes it.
With some other tricks (described in the original √¢¬Ä¬úRCE in Qt5√¢¬Ä¬ù article), it is possible to get a malicious plugin onto the victim√¢¬Ä¬ôs computer, and once they click a malicious URI that injects `-platformpluginpath`, have that plugin be executed.
As a malicious plugin can be executed, this is classified as a remote code execution vulnerability.

## URI Argument Injection Mitigations

Of course, operating systems, browser developers, and software developers do not necessarily do the naive implementation.
As previously mentioned, Bitcoin Core ignores command line arguments found after a URI.
So a URI that injects arguments cannot cause Bitcoin Core to start with any additional Bitcoin Core specific command line arguments.
Additionally, Bitcoin Core specifically registers a URI handler that surrounds the URI with double quotes so that an argument cannot be injected with just spaces.
The attacker has to make a URI that itself contains double quotes to do the injection.

But browser developers are aware of the double quote trick, so they will sanitize the URI before passing it to the operating system to be handled.
Browsers will escape the double quotes, and often do other sanitizing such as replacement of spaces, to ensure that the OS treats the entire URI as a single URI argument, not as multiple command line arguments.
For example, for the URI `bitcoin:BC1QXUFYM7NNUSQZW9R2U5G98USKDAT7XQN4VYZ63S" "-argument`, a possible string actually used would be `bitcoin:BC1QXUFYM7NNUSQZW9R2U5G98USKDAT7XQN4VYZ63S\" \"-argument` and the final command

```
`"C:\Program Files\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt.exe" "bitcoin:BC1QXUFYM7NNUSQZW9R2U5G98USKDAT7XQN4VYZ63S\" \"-argument"

```

Since the double quotes are escaped by being preceded with a backslash (`\`), they are not treated as delimiters between arguments but instead as part of a single argument string.
Another method of sanitizing includes using URL encoding of special characters instead of escaping.

It is important to note that browsers must do this sanitizing in Windows.
Windows itself does not sanitize the URI, so a browser which does not sanitize the URI would allow for arguments to be injected.
However most of the browsers in use today will sanitize the URI in some way which prevents this vulnerability from being exploited.

When it comes to Linux, the `%u` specifier specifically means that the entire URI is to be treated as a single argument.
Properly implemented desktop environments will do this correctly and not allow part of the URI to be treated as separate arguments.
I do not know of any desktop environment that does not do this, so on Linux, the desktop environments prevent this vulnerability from being exploited.

Thus, in practice, argument injection via a URI is almost impossible to execute with Bitcoin Core and modern browsers and desktop environments.
It is because of these mitigations that I believe that this vulnerability cannot actually be exploited.

## Bitcoin Core√¢¬Ä¬ôs Fix

Even though I believe that this vulnerability cannot actually be exploited, it is still prudent to fix the issue.
The fix for this vulnerability is to disallow Qt from processing command line arguments.
Instead of initializing Qt with the real list of command line arguments, we initialize it with an empty list of arguments.
This was implemented in [PR #16578](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16578) which was merged in August 2019.
While this does fix the problem, it does also have the downside that users who do wish to use Qt√¢¬Ä¬ôs other command line arguments to customize how it looks will be unable to do so via command line arguments.
Instead this will need to be done through environment variables.
A future followup would be to allow only some of Qt√¢¬Ä¬ôs command line arguments to be used and/or disallow the dangerous ones.
