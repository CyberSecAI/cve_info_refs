  {
    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-3401",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Qt framework's QApplication class parses command line arguments and has a `-platformpluginpath` argument that can load a plugin from a path and execute it. By crafting a malicious URI, an attacker can inject the `-platformpluginpath` argument to the Qt application, leading to the execution of a malicious plugin. This occurs because the URI argument is not correctly parsed before being passed to QApplication.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "URI Argument Injection: The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary command-line arguments into the Qt application by crafting a malicious URI.",
      "Remote Code Execution: The injected `-platformpluginpath` command-line argument could lead to remote code execution by loading and executing a malicious plugin."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit could lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to potentially take control of a user's machine or gain access to sensitive data.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URI. This URI could be embedded in a website, an email, or any other means that triggers a program to process the URI.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to induce the user to click or otherwise process the malicious URI. This does not require any special privileges, only that the victim is vulnerable."

            "URI argument injection in Qt applications: A vulnerability where command-line arguments for a Qt application can be maliciously injected through a crafted URI.",
