  "CVE-2021-3603": {
    "Description": "PHPMailer 6.4.1 and earlier contain a vulnerability that can result in untrusted code being called. If the `$patternselect` parameter to `validateAddress()` is set to `'php'` (the default), and the global namespace contains a function called `php`, it will be called in preference to the built-in validator of the same name. This is patched in PHPMailer 6.5.0 by denying the use of simple strings as validator function names.",
    "Root cause": "The `validateAddress` function in PHPMailer allows a user-supplied string to be used as a function name to validate email addresses. If a function with the same name as one of the built-in validators exists in the global namespace, this function can be called instead of the built-in validator.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure use of user-supplied data to determine a function to call",
       "Lack of proper validation of function names",
       "Reliance on global namespace for function lookups"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code by injecting a malicious function into the global namespace with the same name as a built-in address validator function, thus achieving remote code execution if the application calls `validateAddress` with the default or vulnerable 'php' validator.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker would need to inject malicious code, in the form of a function, into the global namespace of the PHP application that utilizes PHPMailer before `validateAddress` is called with the vulnerable settings.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the capability to inject a PHP function into the global scope of the PHP application before the vulnerable function call. This could be achieved through other vulnerabilities or by manipulating the server/environment."
