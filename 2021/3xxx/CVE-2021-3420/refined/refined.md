{
  "CVE-2021-3420": {
    "Description": "Improper overflow validation in the memory allocation functions mEMALIGn, pvALLOc, nano_memalign, nano_valloc, nano_pvalloc could cause an integer overflow, leading to an allocation of a small buffer and then to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "Root cause": "Improper overflow validation in memory allocation functions.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
     ],
    "Impact": "Heap-based buffer overflow due to small buffer allocation after integer overflow.",
    "Attack vectors": "Specifically crafted allocation sizes passed to vulnerable functions (mEMALIGn, pvALLOc, nano_memalign, nano_valloc, nano_pvalloc).",
    "Required capabilities": "Ability to control allocation sizes passed to the vulnerable functions."
