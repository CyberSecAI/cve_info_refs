- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An uncontrolled search path element vulnerability exists in the openssl component used within Bitdefender GravityZone Business Security. This allows an attacker to load a malicious third-party DLL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerability. This refers to how the software searches for necessary files, which in this case allows it to be tricked into loading an attacker-controlled DLL.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to privilege escalation on the affected system. This means an attacker can gain higher privileges than they should have, potentially leading to full control of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L). An attacker needs local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) on the targeted system to exploit the vulnerability. They do not require user interaction (UI:N). The vulnerability exists within a component of the Bitdefender GravityZone Business Security, allowing a malicious DLL to be loaded through the openssl component, leading to a privilege escalation.
