Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-3703:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-27918, CVE-2021-31525, and CVE-2021-33196 in the Serverless component. Specifically, the fix was not correctly implemented in the Knative CLI build which used an older version of Go.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The primary weakness is the presence of an unfixed vulnerability due to the usage of an older Go version in the Knative CLI build. This means the previous vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-27918, CVE-2021-31525, and CVE-2021-33196) were still exploitable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The content does not detail the specific impact of exploiting the underlying CVEs (CVE-2021-27918, CVE-2021-31525, and CVE-2021-33196). However, the presence of this incomplete fix indicates the system remains vulnerable to the impacts of these CVEs.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector would involve exploiting the vulnerabilities in the older Go version used by the Knative CLI. The exact attack method would depend on the specifics of CVE-2021-27918, CVE-2021-31525, and CVE-2021-33196.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to have the ability to interact with the vulnerable Knative CLI or trigger the underlying vulnerabilities present in the older Go version.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was addressed in later releases of Serverless (1.17.0) and through Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA-2021:3555 and RHSA-2021:3556).
*   The bug report mentions that the previous releases of Serverless (1.16.0 and Serverless client kn 1.16.0) were incorrectly marked as having the fixes for the related CVEs.
*   The vulnerability was specific to the Knative CLI build, while other components like `knative-serving` and `knative-eventing` were determined not to be affected.

In summary, CVE-2021-3703 represents an incomplete fix, which re-introduces the underlying vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-27918, CVE-2021-31525, CVE-2021-33196) via the Knative CLI due to an outdated Go version.
