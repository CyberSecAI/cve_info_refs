## [PATCH] scsi: mptsas: dequeue request object in case of an error (CVE-20

---

| **From**: | P J P |
| --- | --- |

| **Subject**: | [PATCH] scsi: mptsas: dequeue request object in case of an error (CVE-2021-3392) |
| **Date**: | Tue, 2 Feb 2021 18:51:03 +0530 |

---

```
From: Prasad J Pandit <pjp@fedoraproject.org>

While processing SCSI i/o requests in mptsas_process_scsi_io_request(),
the Megaraid emulator appends new MPTSASRequest object 'req' to
the 's->pending' queue. In case of an error, this same object gets
dequeued in mptsas_free_request() only if SCSIRequest object
'req->sreq' is initialised. This may lead to a use-after-free issue.
Unconditionally dequeue 'req' object from 's->pending' to avoid it.

Fixes: CVE-2021-3392

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1924042#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2021-02-02 13:22:04 UTC  ``` A use-after-free issue was found in the Megaraid emulator of the QEMU. It occurs while processing SCSI i/o requests because in case of an error mptsas_free_request() does not dequeue request object 'req' from a pending requests' queue. Which later gets processed resulting in the said use-after-free issue. A privileged guest user may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Package        : qemu
Version        : 1:2.8+dfsg-6+deb9u14
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-17380 CVE-2021-3392 CVE-2021-3409 CVE-2021-3416
                 CVE-2021-20203 CVE-2021-20255 CVE-2021-20257
Debian Bug     : 984450 984451 984452 984448 984449 970937

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in QEMU, a fast processor
emulator.

CVE-2021-20257

    net: e1000: infinite loop while processing transmit descriptors

CVE-2021-20255

    A stack overflow via an infinite recursion vulnerability was found in the
    eepro100 i8255x device emulator of QEMU. This issue occurs while processing
    controller commands due to a DMA reentry issue. This flaw allows a guest
    user or process to consume CPU cycles or crash the QEMU process on the
    host, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2021-20203

    An integer overflow issue was found in the vmxnet3 NIC emulator of the
    QEMU. It may occur if a guest was to supply invalid values for rx/tx queue
    size or other NIC parameters. A privileged guest user may use this flaw to
    crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.

CVE-2021-3416

    A potential stack overflow via infinite loop issue was found in various NIC
    emulators of QEMU in versions up to and including 5.2.0. The issue occurs
    in loopback mode of a NIC wherein reentrant DMA checks get bypassed. A
    guest user/process may use this flaw to consume CPU cycles or crash the
    QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.

CVE-2021-3416

    The patch for CVE-2020-17380/CVE-2020-25085 was found to be ineffective,
    thus making QEMU vulnerable to the out-of-bounds read/write access issues
    previously found in the SDHCI controller emulation code. This flaw allows a
    malicious privileged guest to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting
    in a denial of service or potential code execution.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
1:2.8+dfsg-6+deb9u14.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.

For the detailed security status of qemu please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/qemu>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Multiple security issues were discovered in QEMU, a fast processor
emulator, which could result in denial of service or the the execution
of arbitrary code.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:3.1+dfsg-8+deb10u9.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.

### Bug Description

\* Cheolwoo Myung of Seoul National University reported a use-after-free issue in the SCSI Megaraid

  emulator of the QEMU.

\* It occurs while handling mptsas\_process\_scsi\_io\_request(), as it does not

  check a list in s->pending.
