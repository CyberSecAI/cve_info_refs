- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The isolation mechanisms within Nomad's `exec` and `java` task drivers did not effectively isolate processes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper process isolation in `exec` and `java` task drivers, allowing access to information about other tasks' processes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious Nomad task could access information about processes associated with other tasks on the same node, including potentially sensitive command lines and environment variables.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious Nomad task running on the same node as other tasks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to run a malicious task on a Nomad client node where other tasks are also running.
