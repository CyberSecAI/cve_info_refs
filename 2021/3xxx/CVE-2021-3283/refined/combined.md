**Bulletin ID:** HCSEC-2021-01

**Affected Products / Versions:** Nomad and Nomad Enterprise, all prior versions; fixed in 0.12.10 and 1.0.3.

**Publication Date:** 29 January, 2021

**Summary**

Nomad and Nomad Enterprise (“Nomad”) `exec` and `java` task drivers may allow a malicious task to access information regarding processes associated with other tasks on the same node. This vulnerability, CVE-2021-3283, affects all prior Nomad versions and is fixed in the 0.12.10 and 1.0.3 releases.

**Background**

Nomad’s [task drivers](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers) implement isolation using mechanisms provided by the Linux kernel. These task drivers can be used to run workloads inside an isolated environment on Nomad client nodes when enabled.

**Details**

It was discovered that the isolation mechanisms within Nomad’s `exec` and `java` task drivers did not effectively isolate processes. This allowed a malicious Nomad task to access information regarding processes associated with other tasks on the same node, including potentially-sensitive command lines and environment variables.

To mitigate this issue, Nomad now implements PID and IPC namespacing for the `exec` and `java` task drivers.

Note that Nomad’s `docker` task driver is not affected by this issue. Third-party task drivers using the shared library for the `exec` and `java` drivers may be exposed.

**Remediation**

Customers should evaluate the risk associated with this issue and consider upgrading to Nomad or Nomad Enterprise 0.12.10, 1.0.3, or newer. Please refer to [Upgrading Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/upgrade) for general guidance and version-specific upgrade notes.

Alternatively, disabling the `exec` and `java` drivers is sufficient to prevent this vulnerability.

**Acknowledgement**

This issue was identified by the Nomad engineering team.
