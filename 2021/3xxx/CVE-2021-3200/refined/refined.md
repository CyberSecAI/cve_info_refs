  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2021-3200",
      "is_relevant": true,
      "summary": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the `testcase_read` function of libsolv due to improper bounds checking in the `MAPCLR` macro.",
      "root_cause": "The `MAPCLR` macro, used within the `testcase_read` function, accesses a `Map` structure's `map` array using an index calculated as `p >> 3`. This index is not properly validated against the `size` of the map, leading to out-of-bounds write.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap-based buffer overflow",
        "Insufficient bounds checking"
      ],
       "impact": "A heap-buffer-overflow can be triggered, leading to a denial-of-service. The program may crash due to an out-of-bounds memory access. The vulnerability is within test functionality which is unlikely to be used in production and it is not clear if the vulnerability can be exploited to anything beyond a crash",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability can be triggered through a crafted testcase file which causes the map index `p >> 3` to be larger than the map `size`."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted input file to the `testcase_read` function or manipulate a process to cause it to process a malicious testcase."
