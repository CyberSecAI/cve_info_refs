| Hidden thread content is able to be viewed without replying by using the *reply* or *quote* button located in the postbit.  By clicking either two buttons you can view the thread content in the `[quote]` brackets without having to actually reply. Example: [example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33612375/106061670-bc5c8000-60c3-11eb-90a0-b7c2799af071.png)  A solution would be to add a custom message inside the quote brackets for users who haven't replied that way thread content isn't revealed. Example: `[quote="admin" pid='17' dateline='1611782869']` `Please reply to this thread to unlock the content.` `[/quote]` |

| I've added custom quote message to resolve this issue. However there seems to be more ways of having a peak at the hidden post. I'll be working on that and release an update on mybb in a day or two. |

| Gotcha, a few other locations I just noticed were the portal page and by using the search, not sure if those are what you have already. |
