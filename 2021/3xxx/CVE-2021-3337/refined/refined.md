Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is that hidden thread content in a forum (likely MyBB based on the discussion) is not properly protected. Specifically, the content can be revealed by using the "reply" or "quote" functionality even without actually replying to the thread. The hidden content was being displayed within the quote brackets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate access control:** The system failed to enforce proper access control mechanisms for hidden thread content.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The hidden content, which was intended to be restricted, was disclosed to users who hadn't met the requirement of replying to the thread.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Users could bypass the intended restriction and access hidden content without having to engage in the thread by replying.
*   **Privacy violation:** Private information intended to be seen by a specific audience was unintentionally made available to other users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Interaction:** By utilizing the "reply" or "quote" buttons located in the postbit, the hidden content was revealed within the quote.
*   **Portal page and Search:** As mentioned in the discussion, other attack vectors include viewing hidden content through the portal page and search functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a user of the forum with access to the thread containing hidden content.
*   No special privileges are required.

**Additional details:**

*   The fix implemented was a custom message inside quote brackets for users who haven't replied.
*   The initial fix was incomplete and there were other ways to view the hidden content (portal page and search).
