- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Zephyr Bluetooth protocol stack does not properly validate the length of incoming HCI data when setting `SCAN_RSP` through the HCI command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper length checks on the incoming HCI data. This leads to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause memory overflow leading to memory overwrite, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered via the HCI command related to setting `SCAN_RSP` in the Bluetooth protocol.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send crafted HCI commands to the vulnerable device. The attack vector is physical, requiring close proximity. The attack complexity is high. User interaction is required.
