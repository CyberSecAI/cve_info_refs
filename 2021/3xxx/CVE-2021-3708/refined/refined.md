Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-3708:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `webupg` binary, specifically within the function that handles MAC address changes. The `webupg` binary uses `snprintf` to format a command string with user-provided input (the new MAC address) and then executes it via the `system` function. The user-provided MAC address is not sanitized and allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input before it's used in a system command. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary shell commands by including them in the MAC address field.
- **Unauthenticated TFTP access:** The router allows unauthenticated access to the TFTP server, allowing anyone on the local network to upload configuration files, which can be crafted to have the attacker's desired credentials.
- **Insecure use of `system` function:** The use of the `system` function with unsanitized input is a common vulnerability pattern, enabling command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute any shell command with root privileges on the affected device due to the `mini_httpd` server running as root and the command injection vulnerability within `webupg`. This level of access could allow the attacker to fully control the device.
- **Device Compromise:** By running arbitrary commands as root, attackers can gain complete access to the device, potentially leading to data exfiltration, malware installation, or complete control of the network.
- **Configuration Manipulation:** Coupled with the tftp misconfiguration vulnerability, the attacker can inject malicious configurations that could affect the router's functionality, user access, or network behaviour.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Network Access:** The attacker must be on the same local network as the vulnerable device to exploit the tftp and command injection vulnerabilities.
- **TFTP configuration overwrite:** The attacker uses the misconfigured TFTP server to overwrite the device's configuration file with a malicious one.
- **HTTP request:** The attacker leverages the `webupg` binary by sending a crafted HTTP POST request, including a valid session ID, and a malicious MAC address using the "mac" parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be on the same local network as the targeted D-Link DSL-2750U router.
- **Basic Knowledge of HTTP and Shell Commands:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft HTTP requests and have basic knowledge of shell commands for injection.
- **TFTP Server Access** : The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the device over tftp.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text also mentions CVE-2021-3707, which is related to unauthorized configuration modification via TFTP and is used in the exploit chain for CVE-2021-3708.
*   The device is a D-Link DSL-2750U router with firmware version vME1.16 (or prior).
*   The vulnerability was patched in firmware version vME\_1.22.
*   The exploit chain involves overwriting the router's configuration file via TFTP with a crafted configuration containing known credentials, obtaining a valid session ID, and then sending a command injection payload using the `mac` action within the `webupg` binary.
