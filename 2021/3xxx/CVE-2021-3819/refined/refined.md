Based on the provided content, the changes in the commit primarily focus on converting GET routes to POST routes for several functionalities in the Firefly III application. This includes actions related to currency management (enabling/disabling currencies) and transaction group cloning. This change seems to be a security best practice, using POST for actions that modify data, but this specific commit does not highlight a vulnerability.

Specifically, the following changes were made:

*   **Currency Enable/Disable:** The routes for enabling and disabling currencies were changed from GET to POST requests.
*   **Transaction Group Cloning:**  The route for cloning a transaction group was also changed from GET to POST.
*   **JavaScript Updates:** Corresponding JavaScript files were updated to send POST requests with necessary data (including a CSRF token) for these actions.
*   **Controller Modifications:** The controller methods handling these requests were updated to use the POST method and retrieve the necessary ID from the request body.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** There is no vulnerability detailed. However, the change is likely done for security reasons to conform with best practices of using POST for actions that modify data and to mitigate CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** None listed.

**Impact of exploitation:** Not applicable as no exploitation described.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** Not applicable.

**Conclusion:**

The content describes a commit that refactors several routes from GET to POST methods, which is likely done to enhance security by better adhering to RESTful principles and to prevent CSRF attacks. There is no mention of a specific vulnerability being addressed by this change.
