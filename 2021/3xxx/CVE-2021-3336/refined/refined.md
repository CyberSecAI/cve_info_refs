  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `certificate_verify` message during a TLS 1.3 handshake. Specifically, a malicious attacker with a privileged network position can impersonate a TLS 1.3 server. The client, during the handshake process, fails to adequately verify the signature of the `certificate_verify` message, allowing the attacker to bypass authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient verification of the `certificate_verify` message",
      "Lack of proper authentication mechanisms for TLS 1.3 clients in certain scenarios"
    ],
    "impact": "A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where a malicious attacker can impersonate a TLS 1.3 server, bypassing client authentication and establishing an insecure connection. This could allow the attacker to eavesdrop on the communication, modify the exchanged data or perform further malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack.",
        "Network position to intercept and modify traffic during TLS handshake"

    "required_capabilities": "Attacker requires the ability to intercept network traffic during the TLS 1.3 handshake and to impersonate a server. This requires a privileged network position to establish the MITM attack."

    "summary": "The content describes a man-in-the-middle vulnerability in wolfSSL's TLS 1.3 client implementation. The vulnerability allows a malicious attacker with a privileged network position to impersonate a server during the TLS handshake, due to improper verification of the certificate_verify message, leading to an insecure connection. This is described in CVE-2021-3336 and fixed in version 4.7.0.",
