- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Perl script `manual_ping.cgi` in `/usr/local/webmin/System/` passes user-supplied input to the `system()` function without sufficient sanitization, allowing for command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authenticated root command injection. The lack of proper input sanitization before passing user-controlled data to the `system()` function is the core vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands with root privileges on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attacker must be authenticated to access the vulnerable `manual_ping.cgi` script. The attack is performed by injecting shell commands into the input fields intended for the ping command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker must have valid credentials to log into the web interface and access the vulnerable script.
