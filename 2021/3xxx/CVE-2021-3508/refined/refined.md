Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-3508:

**Root Cause:**
- An infinite loop occurs in the `get_xref_linear_skipped()` function within `pdf.c` when processing a crafted PDF file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `get_xref_linear_skipped()` function searches backward for the "xref" keyword after finding a "trailer". If "xref" is not found by going back one byte at a time (implemented by `fseek(fp, -2, SEEK_CUR)`), it goes into an infinite loop. The vulnerability is caused by lack of checks to prevent reading beyond the beginning of file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The program enters an infinite loop, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition as the program will hang indefinitely.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious actor can craft a PDF file specifically to trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing the malicious PDF with `pdfresurrect`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted PDF file to the application using it, as is, `pdfresurrect`.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in PDFResurrect version 0.22b.
- The issue was reported by `chibataiki`.
- A fix has been implemented in commit `7e35d18` which includes a boundary check.
- The fix is included in version `0.23b`.
