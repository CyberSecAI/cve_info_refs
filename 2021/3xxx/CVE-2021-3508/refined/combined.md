| Hi, I found an infinite loop in function `get_xref_linear_skipped` in pdf.c  env: version: v0.22b commit [af10865](https://github.com/enferex/pdfresurrect/commit/af10865670d23208bcd58e490966a6013e8ab9ff) OS: ubuntu 20.04  If found 'trailer' ,then look backwards for 'xref'. But if there isn't character 'x' backward, the function `get_xref_linear_skipped` will go into an infinite loop.  ``` ─── source:pdf.c+729 ────     724        return;     725     726      /* If we found 'trailer' look backwards for 'xref' */     727      ch = 0;     728      while (SAFE_F(fp, ((ch = fgetc(fp)) != 'x')))                // fp=0x0000ffffffffeea8  →  [...]  →  0x00000000fbad2488  →  729        fseek(fp, -2, SEEK_CUR);     730     731      if (ch == 'x')     732      {     733          xref->start = ftell(fp) - 1;     734          fseek(fp, -1, SEEK_CUR); ─────────────────────────────────────────────  ```  poc(zipped ): [pdfresurrect\_hang\_1.zip](https://github.com/enferex/pdfresurrect/files/6323748/pdfresurrect_hang_1.zip)  To reproduct:  ./pdfresurrect [poc]  reporter: chiba of Topsec alphaLab |
