Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3151:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of input validation and output encoding in the i-doit web application, specifically when handling user-supplied input in the application's request parameters. This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- Lack of input validation and output encoding on several parameters related to monitoring configurations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application.
- This injected code executes in the browsers of users who access the affected application content.
- The attacker could potentially steal session tokens or login credentials.
- The attacker can perform arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim user.
- Keystrokes of the user can be logged

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks are possible by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the affected application.
- The attack involves modifying the following parameters:  `C__MONITORING__CONFIG__TITLE`, `SM2__C__MONITORING__CONFIG__TITLE[p_strValue]`, `C__MONITORING__CONFIG__PATH`, `SM2__C__MONITORING__CONFIG__PATH[p_strValue]`, `C__MONITORING__CONFIG__ADDRESS`, and `SM2__C__MONITORING__CONFIG__ADDRESS[p_strValue]`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs low privileges to inject the malicious script, i.e. the attacker needs to have access to the application and modify its parameters.
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the application.
- User interaction is required, as the injected script executes when another user views the page containing the malicious code.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same local network as the victim.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable parameters are related to monitoring configurations.
- The vulnerability was found in i-doit version 1.15.2 and likely prior versions.
- The issue is resolved in version 1.16.0 of the software.
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates the injection of a simple JavaScript alert, which serves as an example of malicious code execution. The PoC includes the HTTP request with the injected script, and screenshots showing the script being executed in the browser.
