**Bulletin ID:** HCSEC-2021-04

**Affected Products / Versions:** Vault Enterprise 1.6.0 and 1.6.1; fixed in 1.6.2.

**Publication Date:** 29 January, 2021

**Summary**

Vault Enterprise 1.6.0 and 1.6.1 allowed the `remove-peer` raft operator command to be executed against DR secondaries without authentication. This vulnerability, CVE-2021-3282, was fixed in Vault Enterprise 1.6.2.

**Background**

Vault Enterprise clusters configured with [integrated storage](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/internals/integrated-storage) (also known as the Raft storage engine) and [replication](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/enterprise/replication) use the Raft consensus algorithm to ensure that all nodes have replicated the same data.

**Details**

It was discovered that the `remove-peer` raft operator command could be executed against DR secondaries without authentication. While it isn’t possible to remove the final node, it may still be possible to compromise the cluster’s availability.

**Remediation**

Customers should evaluate the risk associated with this issue and consider upgrading to Vault Enterprise 1.6.2 or newer. Please refer to [Upgrading Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/upgrading) for general guidance and version-specific upgrade notes.

**Acknowledgement**

This issue was discovered by the Vault engineering team.
