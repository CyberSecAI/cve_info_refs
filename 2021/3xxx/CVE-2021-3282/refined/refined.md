**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `remove-peer` Raft operator command could be executed against Disaster Recovery (DR) secondaries without authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of authentication for the `remove-peer` Raft operator command on DR secondaries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- While the final node cannot be removed, exploitation may compromise cluster availability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending the `remove-peer` command to a DR secondary.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to a DR secondary node within a Vault Enterprise cluster.
- No authentication is required.
