Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3836:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper configuration of the XML parser in the `XMLUtils.java` file. Specifically, the `DocumentBuilderFactory` was not configured to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core vulnerability is an XXE vulnerability. The code was using the default settings of the `DocumentBuilderFactory`, which can be susceptible to XXE attacks if the XML being parsed references external entities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An XXE vulnerability can have several impacts:
* **Information disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read local files on the server where the application is running.
* **Denial of service:** An attacker could cause the server to consume excessive resources by requesting large external files.
* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker might be able to make the server perform requests to other internal or external services.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted XML input. An attacker needs to provide an XML document that contains a reference to an external entity that points to either a local file or an external resource. This malicious XML would then be parsed by the vulnerable `XMLUtils.java` code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to submit arbitrary XML to the application which will then be parsed by the vulnerable XML parser. This could be through various means depending on the applicationâ€™s functionality, such as uploading a file, sending data through an API, or other methods that can be used to submit user controlled XML to the vulnerable parser.

**Additional Details:**
The provided content shows the specific code change to fix the vulnerability which was setting the `XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING` feature to true on the `DocumentBuilderFactory`. This prevents the parser from resolving external entities and prevents the XXE attack. The github commit diff shows the following code change:
