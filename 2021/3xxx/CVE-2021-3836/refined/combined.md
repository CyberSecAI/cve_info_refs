@akilovich - sure 👍

Because [@srikanthprathi](https://github.com/srikanthprathi) disclosed a valid security vulnerability to us, we are able to create a CVE for this report.

A CVE notifies developers using your package about this vulnerability, and the version that patches it as well.

You can read more about it [here](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/security/what-is-cve).
